## ðŸŽ¨ Design Adherence

All new components follow the established design system:
- âœ… Dark mode (#0f172a background)
- âœ… Teal primary (#14b8a6)
- âœ… Orange secondary (#f97316)
- âœ… Rounded corners (0.75rem)
- âœ… Minimalist aesthetic
- âœ… Generous padding (24px)
- âœ… Subtle shadows

## ðŸ’¡ Key Innovation: Mock Data Alignment

All features use data structures that **exactly match** the real backend schema from `task.md`:

- `Finding` schema with evidence_strength, sample_size
- `GapCell` with organism, tissue, exposure, duration
- `OntologyTerm` with id, label, source_obo
- `ExternalContent` for NASA News/Explainers (ready for integration)

**Result:** When backend is ready, only need to swap API import - all types remain unchanged!
