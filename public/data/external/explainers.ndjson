These missions will help pioneer scientific discovery beyond theVan Allen belts.\n\nVariables in space, likemicrogravityorionizing radiation, are different than they are on Earth. For example, the Moon has only ⅙ of Earth’s gravity and a much thinner atmosphere, which experiences more intense radiation. These differences affect living organisms, including plants.\n\nUnderstanding these differences is vital to helping astronauts go farther and stay longer in space.\n\nSeveral biological life forms, including plant seeds, flew aboard the Artemis I mission.\n\nArtemis I was an uncrewed test flight of the Space Launch System (SLS) and the Orion spacecraft, which flew around the Moon. The primary goals for the test flight were to demonstrate Orion’s systems and thus ensure a safe journey to the Moon and back for the first crewed flight on Artemis II.1\n\nThe Orion spacecraft had plant seeds on board. These seeds had been modified to hold increased nutrients. Since spaceflight can strip seeds of their nutrient reserves, the goal of this experiment was to see if modifications could preserve the nutritional value of the seeds. The seeds in question had increased levels of branched-chain amino acids, which are essential to humans and can only be obtained from plants.2\n\nBeyond researching how to make seeds hardier for space travel, scientists also want to understand how to grow plants in space.\n\nGrowing plants in space is very different from growing them on Earth. In space, water “floats” and the supply of it is limited. The angles and hours of sunshine are different, and so is the circadian rhythm. Research is vital to overcoming these challenges, and to making it possible for plants to be grown on missions.\n\nThe Artemis I mission was the precursor to Artemis II and Artemis III. During the Artemis II mission, astronauts will orbit the Moon. The Artemis III mission will enable astronauts to land on the Moon and eventually establish a basecamp.3\n\nEventually, these pathfinding missions on the Moon will help enable Mars exploration.\n\nMissions to Mars could take months each way, and given the limited room aboard the spacecraft, the crew will only be able to bring limited supplies. Many supplies — like food — will need to be made instead of taken.\n\nUnderstanding how to adapt plants for environments in space is crucial for supporting these crewed Artemis missions. Scientists will need to understand what plants will still provide astronauts with nutritional benefits, and what food can be grown in space. Eventually certain plants could even be identified as viable future space crops.\n\nThis research could contribute to agricultural innovations that benefit humanity. Learning more about what makes plants thrive in the extreme conditions of space could also enable us to grow hardier and more nutritional crops in harsh environments on Earth.\n\n1https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/biological-physical/around-the-moon-and-back-a-test-drive-for-science\n\n2https://science.nasa.gov/biological-physical/investigations/life-beyond-earth\n\n3https://www.nasa.gov/specials/artemis/\n\nWebb is the premier observatory of the next decade, serving thousands of astronomers worldwide.

People have always tried to leave the world a better place for future generations.” - unknown\n\nOne of the largest hazards for astronauts traveling to Mars will be overcoming exposure to high energy radiation from the solar wind, solar storms, and galactic cosmic rays that originate outside of our solar system. This radiation is more damaging to humans than medical X-rays used to see broken bones or treat cancer.\n\nThe Earth’s magnetosphere traps the high energy radiation particles and shields the Earth from the solar storms and the constantly streaming solar wind that can damage technology as well as people living on Earth.\n\nThese trapped particles form two belts of radiation, known as the Van Allen Belts, that surround the Earth like enormous donuts1. The outer belt is made up of billions of high-energy particles that originate from the Sun and the inner belt results from interactions of cosmic rays with Earth’s atmosphere.\n\nAstronauts must fly though the Van Allen Belts to reach outer space, so it is important to fly through this region quickly to limit their exposure to radiation. Sensitive electronics on satellites and space craft traveling through the Van Allen Belts also need to be protected from the radiation.\n\nLocated beyond low-Earth orbit, these radiation belts were discovered in 1958 by astrophysicist James Van Allen who helped uncover the key to enabling exploration of the outer solar system. Van Allen calculated that it was possible to fly through the weaker regions of radiation to reach outer space.\n\nIn 1968, NASA’s Apollo Mission 8 was the first crewed spaceship to fly beyond the Van Allen belts to orbit the Moon and then return to Earth. The most recent time humans have set foot on the Moon or traveled beyond low-Earth orbit was in 1972, during the final mission of the Apollo program, Apollo 17.\n\nWhen the International Space Station was completed in 2011, its low-Earth orbit made it safer for astronauts to travel to and from the station as it is a shorter distance from Earth, approximately 250 miles— roughly the distance between Washington, DC, and New York City.\n\nNASA plans to use its upcoming Artemis missions to send astronauts beyond the Van Allen Belts to land on the south pole of the Moon by the end of 2025, and eventually on to Mars.\n\nSince a one-way trip to Mars could take six to nine months, it is important to first develop technologies and conduct research on the Moon to better understand what is needed to thrive in deep space.\n\nSince the Moon is more accessible to us than Mars, scientists can use it to gain important scientific knowledge about the effects of the harsh conditions of deep space on living systems. Altered gravity, high energy radiation exposure, and different atmospheric composition are just a few of the unique stressors that can affect our ability to sustain life off-Earth.\n\nTheArtemis Imission was an important step towards understanding the impacts to life beyond the Van Allen Belts by flying model organisms around the Moon and back. This research could help identify which crops to grow on the Moon, alternative sources of fuel, and how to ensure crew health during long periods of exposure to the harsh conditions of space beyond the protective layers of the Van Allen Belts.\n\nAround the Moon and Back: A Test Drive for ScienceStudying the Van Allen Belts 60 Years After America’s First SpacecraftRadiation Belts – Fun Facts\n\nCitations1https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/rbsp/mission/fun-facts.html\n\nWebb is the premier observatory of the next decade, serving thousands of astronomers worldwide.

One way to do this is by using organisms that possess properties similar to humans, such as fungi.\n\nThe Biological and Physical Sciences (BPS) Division at NASA conducted four investigations, collectively known asBiological Experiment 01 (BioExpt-01), using model organisms aboard theArtemis Imission, an uncrewed test flight sent around the Moon and back. Here’s why fungi was among the four “passengers”…\n\nThere are three main reasons fungi was included. First, researchers can test how fungi is impacted by the high levels of radiation experienced during space exploration. Understanding how radiation affects microorganisms like fungi can allow researchers to find new strategies or medicines to prevent astronauts from radiation harm.\n\nSecond, researchers want to develop new biomaterials to make a protective coating for spacecrafts and the electronic equipment used in space. Understanding how fungi responds to radiation will aid in the development of this protective layer.\n\nThird, researchers want to learn how fungi can be used in space biomanufacturing. Fungi could help eventually produce biomaterials, medicine, and even food used to sustain life on other planets. The ability to “make, not take” certain supplies eliminates the need to transport them from Earth, saving costs.\n\nFungi have a natural ability to survive and grow in extreme conditions. Fungi are one of the first organisms to thrive in environments on Earth that experience nuclear activity and, therefore, high levels of radiation.\n\nResearchers are particularly interested in observing the importance of fungi’s natural protective qualities, such as DNA repair and melanin synthesis. How DNA repairs itself after damage caused by radiation can affect the adaption and survival of an organism. Melanin, a pigment occurring in the hair, skin, and iris of the eye that helps block damaging ultraviolet rays, could also be key to surviving in harsh environments outside of Earth.\n\nThese findings about the impact of radiation and the effectiveness of fungi’s natural protective qualities can be applied to humans, helping to protect astronauts as they explore and establish a sustainable presence in space —during future Artemis II and Artemis III missions.\n\nWebb is the premier observatory of the next decade, serving thousands of astronomers worldwide.

A study published in npj Microgravity shows how analyzing diverse datasets together can reveal insights that might otherwise be missed — in this case, linking space-grown food quality to astronaut nutrition and gut health.\n\nThepaperreviewed previous studies of plants grown aboard the International Space Station. The authors found that some edible plants grown in low Earth orbit have lower concentrations of essential nutrients, like calcium and magnesium, than those grown on Earth.\n\nThe reduced levels of these nutrients could make crops not as effective in mitigating the bone loss and reduced immune function that astronauts encounter in space.\n\nThree Analysis Working Groups from NASA'sOpen Science Data Repositorycollaborated to make this paper possible. These discipline-specific groups typically work independently, but this project sparked conversations among researchers with different specialties.\n\nResearchers combined plant data, crop nutrition profiles, gut studies, and astronaut blood biomarkers — a data integration effort of the Biological and Physical Sciences Divisionopen sciencemodel. The work also draws on data from JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency).\n\nFor NASA, these findings offer new insights into how to feed and support astronauts in space, particularly on long-duration missions to the Moon and Mars.\n\nThe study also examined increased intestinal permeability — often called “leaky gut” — a condition that can result from poor nutrition and may be exacerbated by the space environment. Intestinal permeability may interfere with how astronauts absorb nutrients and regulate immune responses.\n\nIf properly engineered, space-grown crops could offer a solution to these health challenges. The team outlined several potential strategies, including bioengineering plants with higher nutrient content, incorporating more antioxidant-rich species, and designing personalized nutrition plans using astronauts' genetic information.\n\nThe study suggests targeting specific biological pathways, such as using compounds like quercetin, an antioxidant found in certain crops, to address bone health challenges at the molecular level.

The findings of his research with Dr. Dorothy Shippen offer insight into the effects of spaceflight on plant chromosomes and how these findings could impact human health.\n\nBarbero:The best analogy is a shoelace. At the very tip of a shoelace is a piece of plastic called an aglet. The aglet holds the shoelace together. If it is damaged or removed, the shoelace begins to unravel. Telomeres are compound structures at the very tip of a chromosome. They protect the ends of chromosomes from becoming frayed or tangled. Therefore, telomeres are vital for chromosome survival.\n\nBarbero:They are probably the best-known markers of cell survival. It is a longevity marker. The length of a telomere is a very important indicator of the health of an organism. In humans, if telomeres are too long, it could be a marker of malignancies like cancer. If telomeres are too short, it could be a sign of premature aging. As humans get older, their telomeres become shorter over time. Plants do not have cancer, but a shorter telomere length is a marker for the plant not being able to survive multiple generations.\n\nAging, genetics, and environmental factors cause telomere shortening. The ideal length for a telomere is species specific. A healthy telomere length for humans is between 5-15 kilobases (a unit of measure used to designate the length of DNA or RNA). InArabidopsis thaliana(Col-0 ecotype), a model plant related to mustard plants, a healthy telomere range is between 2-5 kilobases.\n\nBarbero:The idea was sparked by theNASA Twins Study. Identical twin brothers, Mark and Scott Kelly, both NASA astronauts, participated in an experiment that helped scientists better understand the impacts of spaceflight on the human body. This was accomplished by comparing Scott Kelly, who spent one year on the International Space Station, to his brother, Mark Kelly, who remained on Earth.\n\nOne of the key findings of the study was the change in telomere length. Scott Kelly’s telomeres grew longer while he was in space. When he returned to Earth, some of his telomeres fell below baseline. As mentioned previously, telomere lengthening can be a hallmark for malignancies. Short telomeres are associated with stem cell disease. So, that led us to question, is this something that happens in other organisms? What happens to plant telomeres in microgravity?\n\nIf we want to rely on plants as a food source and as a way to generate oxygen and remove carbon dioxide, we need to make sure plants last a long time in space.\n\nBarbero:This experiment was launched in June of 2021 on the SpaceX-22 Commercial Resupply Services mission. We used Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings that were kept in a petri dish. They grew inside the Vegetable Production System (Veggie) hardware on the International Space Station for 12 days. The samples were then frozen and sent back down to Earth. The plants were then carefully dissected and analyzed in a lab.\n\nBarbero:To our surprise, the plants that were kept on the International Space Station had no change in telomere length. The length of the telomeres in space were the same as the plants on Earth. This leads us to believe that plants may be more than capable of maintaining their genome in harsh environments, which means, plants can be kept through many generations in low Earth orbit.\n\nBarbero:We have a pretty good idea of the mechanism of telomere maintenance in plants. There’s a potential avenue to understand how this mechanism can possibly benefit human telomeres. We can investigate how the plant telomere maintenance mechanism differs from human telomere maintenance mechanisms. This could help us understand why human telomeres got longer in space. It’s a very tough question to answer, but that’s why we need to keep pushing towards the same goal in science.\n\nBarbero:Now, we are trying to understand how radiation affects plant telomeres. We will investigate howArabidopsis thalianatelomeres respond to a wide range of stressors in a state-of-the-art galactic cosmic ray simulator. In the Artemis era, where humans are going to be exposed to a greater amount of radiation, we also need to study how plant telomeres are maintained with an increasing source of radiation. Could plants be a reliable food source beyond low Earth orbit?", "ocr_text": "", "media_assets":

After the oxygen tank explosion and subsequent damage to the spacecraft, the agency used simulators and vehicle modeling not only to evaluate the cause of the anomaly but also to develop and test real-time solutions for the astronauts' survival.\n\nDecades after Apollo 13, John Vickers, principal technologist and associate director of the Materials and Processes Laboratory at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center, was credited with coining the term “digital twins,” in 2010.\n\nInstruments and spacecraft systems continue to grow in complexity. The digital twin’s goal is not only to ensure these technologies operate as expected and for longer durations but also to enablereal-time monitoring, predictive maintenance and adaptive decision-making – such capabilities are critical as we prepare to return to the Moon.It can play a critical role in forecasting the probabilities of mission success.\n\nSeveral digital twins helped successfully test and monitor the James Webb Space Telescope. The world’s most advanced space telescope, which stands four stories high and the length of a tennis court, could not fit in NASA’s thermal vacuum chamber, prompting the Agency to build a digital twin.\n\nOne digital twin modeled the telescope “core” to test its core temperature since a spike in temperature could make the telescope “blind” and unable to look for the universe’s most distant galaxies. Next, a 3D video-based digital twin was developed to enable NASA scientists and partners to follow in real time the unfurling of the giant telescope’smassive sunshield, a complicated maneuver that had 344 different ways to fail.\n\nThese virtual models are alsotransforming analytics on Earth, providing an integrated picture of Earth systems, past and present, as well as how they will evolve in the future.Using a replica of Earth, NASA can detect and monitor floods, the planet’s oceans for carbon, wildfires and air quality, to name a few examples. NASA’s Wildfire Digital Twin uses AI and machine learning to forecast potential burn paths, merging data from sensors to produce precise global models.\n\nDigital twins hold great promise torevolutionize personalized medicine, from preventing to treating diseases. On Earth, digital twins are already used to suggest real-time adjustments to insulin delivery for patients with Type 1 diabetes and show great potential in diagnosing and treating cardiac conditions.\n\nIn space,astronaut digital twins could play a pivotal role in predicting and mitigating health issues during missions.By integrating genomic profiles, age, gender, previous flight data and medical history, these tools could enable real-time health monitoring and personalized interventions, paving the way for safer deep space exploration.\n\nDigital twins could provide the path forward for humanity to realize its deep-space ambitions. From modeling and simulation to real-time monitoring, digital twins show promise to enhance the safety and reliability of space missions in the era of AI and autonomous operations.\n\nDigital twins are transforming life on Earth, making it easier to anticipate and tackle complex problems. We now enjoy a better picture of Earth, including predicting natural disasters. The technology shows great promise in improving how we diagnose, treat and monitor conditions like heart disease and diabetes, so people live longer, healthier lives.\n\nRelated resources:\n\nDigital Twin Summit NASA PowerPoint Presentation\n\nAbout BPS:\n\nNASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences Division pioneers scientific discovery and enables exploration by using space environments to conduct investigations not possible on Earth.

This research could help protect astronauts on future long-duration missions to the Moon and Mars, while also advancing treatments for millions of people on Earth who suffer from osteoporosis.\n\nDuring long-duration missions, astronauts may experience a gradual reduction in bone density—typically around 1% to 2% per month—even with consistent exercise routines. While scientists understand how bones work on Earth, they aren’t sure exactly why bones weaken so quickly in microgravity.\n\nPrevious research aboard the space station revealed that microgravity changes how stem cells behave and what substances they release. Scientists now want to dig deeper into these cellular changes to better understand what causes bone loss in space and explore potential ways to prevent it.\n\nThe Microgravity Associated Bone Loss-B (MABL-B) investigation focuses on special stem cells called mesenchymal stem cells, or MSCs. As these cells mature, they build new bone tissue in the body.\n\nScientists suspect that a protein called IL-6 might be the culprit behind bone problems in space. Data from the earlierMABL-A missionsuggests that microgravity promotes the type of IL-6 signaling that enhances bone degradation. The MABL-B experiment will investigate this by testing ways to block this IL-6 signaling pathway.\n\nThe experiment will grow mesenchymal stem cells alongside other bone cells in special containers designed for space research. Cells will be cultured for 19 days aboard the space station, with crew members periodically collecting samples for analysis back on Earth.\n\nThe research could lead to targeted treatments that protect astronauts from bone loss during long-duration missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond. As crews venture farther from Earth, bone health becomes increasingly critical since medical evacuation or emergency return to Earth won't be possible during Mars missions.\n\nThe findings could provide new insights into age-related bone loss that affects millions of people on Earth. Understanding how the IL-6 protein affects bone health may lead to new treatments for osteoporosis and other bone conditions that come with aging.\n\nNASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences Divisionpioneers scientific discovery and enables exploration by using space environments to conduct investigations not possible on Earth.

For example, when water freezes, it becomes ice, which is a molecular crystal. Some crystals are a mixture of different kinds of materials.\n\nThe world would be a very different place if it wasn’t for crystals. We come in contact with crystals every day—from your coffee cup to your cell phone. Almost all metals, ceramics, and semiconductors are crystals. Silicon is a crystal used to form the “brains” of electronic and computing devices such as microprocessors or memory chips. All computers and cell phones have semiconductor crystals inside of them. Other types of semiconductor crystals can be used as detectors for different optic wavelengths, such as infrared, x-ray, and gamma ray.\n\nTurbine blades, made from metal crystals, are used in the engines of jets.\n\nLasers, such as the ones used in scanners at the grocery store, are made from optical crystals, which are a type of semiconductor crystal. TheGrowth of Ternary Compound Semiconductors (GTCS) experimentcompares zinc selenide crystals grown in space against the ones grown on Earth. Results could improve high-powered lasers operating in infrared wavelengths by providing insights on how gravity affects the electrical, structural, and optical characteristics of crystals.\n\nScientists have been trying to optimize crystallization processes for many years. They study different kinds of crystal growth parameters to optimize the specific kind of crystal they want to grow. Optimizing crystal growth can lead to improvements in various fields such asmedicineand technology.\n\nCrystals grown on Earth tend to have defects. Little cracks in the crystals can be detrimental to the properties that scientists want to achieve with the crystal. That’s why NASA grows crystals on the International Space Station—in a microgravity environment, where many classes of crystals grow better. Gravity gives rise to convection, which can have negative effects on the quality of the crystal. In a microgravity environment, there’s significantly less convection, which results in crystals of much higher purity. The ISS is used as a laboratory to understand the crystallization process. By learning these processes, they can be applied on Earth.\n\nCrystallization 101: Why NASA studies crystals in space:https://youtu.be/XR1hqp9GR0Q\n\nSpace crystals contribute to advancements in technology:https://youtu.be/Arqg1n1jl4Q", "ocr_text": "", "media_assets": ["https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/missions/hubble/galaxies/spiral/Hubble_NGC2775_potw2538a.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/esd/eo/content-feature/aerosols/images/aerosol_fine_fraction_depth_201008_hammer.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/acd25-132-006.jpg?w=1024", "https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/ARC-1969-A-16712/ARC-1969-A-16712~large.jpg?w=1920&h=1382&fit=clip&crop=faces%2Cfocalpoint", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/uc-s03-working-file-horizontal-v02-2.png?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/1-pia26662-dsc4667-enhanced-nr.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/taking-in-the-view-surface-from-hls.png?w=1024", "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/themes/nasa-child/assets/images/nasa-logo@2x.png", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/cds/general/images/2023/03/53636962950-44cdcf9882-o.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/jsc2023e006587.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/cds/learn/science-activation-stories/2025/2025-0805-RiversofStarsandStories-30-moonactivity-sm-Brandi_Stewart.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/psd/solar-system/skywatching/2025/october/02_Jupiter%20and%20Saturn_Credit_Preston%20Dyches_CC%20BY-NC%202.0.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/iss070e001252.jpg?w=1024", "https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/AFRC2025-0013-02/AFRC2025-0013-02~large.jpg?w=1919&h=1536&fit=clip&crop=faces%2Cfocalpoint", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/astro/exo-explore/exoplanet-artists-concepts/WISPIT%202%20b%20Wide%20Final.png?w=1024", "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/sodium-chloride-crystals-9510583796-e8de0230fc-o-johnson-flickr.jpg", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/cds/general/images/2023/09/exoplanetwatch-896.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/img-3738.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/missions/webb/science/2025/09/STScI-01K6196E18EPYF8RDEAQVA01Y3.png?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/missions/prism/prism-data-cube.png?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/psd/photojournal/pia/pia13/pia13126/PIA13126.tif?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/astro/programs/exep/images/exo.png?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/esd/articles/2025/hydroflame_banner.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/afrc2025-0030-83.jpg?w=1024", "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/concrete-hardening-51872765082-1feb8a7ca7-o-johnson-flickr.jpg?w=2048", "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/crystals-grown-in-microgravity-0004364medium.jpg", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/esd/articles/2025/A90%20NASA%20Chesapeake%20Shawn%20Serbin.jpeg?w=1024", "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/concrete-hardening-51872765082-1feb8a7ca7-o-johnson-flickr.jpg", "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/crystals-grown-in-microgravity-0004364medium.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/content/dam/science/astro/programs/physics-of-the-cosmos/images/gwsig/gravitational_waves-16.gif", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/gsfc-20171208-archive-e000760orig-stpatricksaurora-iotd.jpg?w=1024", "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/sodium-chloride-crystals-9510583796-e8de0230fc-o-johnson-flickr.jpg?w=2048", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/20240131-207a0543.png?w=1024"], "referenced_urls": [], "provenance": {"parser_path": "external.explainers", "fetched_at": "2025-10-04T03:36:24.206423", "source_type": "html"}}

This is the International year of quantum and BPS is studying the world we don't see.", "published_at": "2025-04-02T12:29:41-04:00", "authors": ["NASA Science Editorial Team"], "tags": ["ISS Research", "NASA Directorates", "Biological &amp; Physical Sciences", "Science Divisions", "Biological & Physical Sciences", "Science Mission Directorate"], "body_text": "The United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has dubbed 2025 the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology, in honor of 100 years of research in the field of quantum mechanics. The milestone prompts the question, “Why should we study the world we don’t see?”\n\nWe live in a quantum world — in the realm of the very small. Comprised of atomic and subatomic particles, or the building blocks of all matter, quantum research helps us better understand the connected nature of a universe, but even with quantum mechanics,scientists can only explain less than 5% of the mass and energy in the known universe.\n\nAs a branch of physics,quantum mechanics explains what classical physics cannot: how particles behave like waves at the atomic level. Quantum research makes it possible to explain the behavior and interactions between these particles, as well as the forces that hold atoms together and give structure to our universe. It underlies everyday devices such as cellphones, computers, medical devices, and GPS, not to mention lasers, fiber optics, and LEDs.\n\nNASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences (BPS) Division uses the unique conditions of space to dive deeper into the behavior of these atomsand, at the same time, to uncover whether Albert Einstein was right about how the universe behaves. In Einstein’s theory, time does not pass at the same rate for everyone. Space and time are warped by matter.\n\nValidating Einstein’s theory of general relativity deepens our understanding of gravity and can provide insightsinto the nature ofdark matteranddark energy, which comprise 95% of the mass and energy of the cosmos. Furthermore, we can only detect these phenomena on cosmological scales; that is, through their effects on the scale of galaxies and throughout the universe, not locally from our vantage point on Earth.\n\nAstronomers call dark matter the galaxy’s “scaffolding” — we can’t see it, but we can feel its gravitational pull. Dark energy, meanwhile, is like a balloon inflating in space — a mysterious influence driving the accelerated expansion of the universe.\n\nLaunched to the space station in May 2018, serves as a first-of-its-kind facility to study ultra-cold atoms in microgravity. The approximate size of a small refrigerator, the Cold Atom Lab often is labeled the “coolest place in the known universe,” because of its ability to chill atoms to almost absolute zero. These almost motionless atoms, called Bose-Einstein Condensates, get so cold they begin acting like a single, large particle, allowing scientists to observe quantum effects.While scientists demonstrated the first Bose-Einstein Condensate in 1995, the microgravity environment of space bypasses terrestrial limitations, enabling studies of quantum matter that cannot be conducted on Earth. The experiments NASA is performing using the Cold Atom Lab will someday allow scientists to measure gravity with unprecedented precision.Precise measurements of gravity could underly future technologies that improve spacecraft navigation, track water on Earth, explore the composition of moons and other planets from orbit, and probe mysterious cosmic phenomena, like dark matter and dark energy.\n\nExplore\n\nSEAQUE was deployed in November 2024 on the Materials International Space Station Experiment. This experiment aims to demonstrate quantum-level communication in space through entanglement, a fundamental principle in quantum physics where particles remain connected even when separated by great distance. SEAQUE is testing technologies that could enable secure, long-distance quantum communication using entangled photons, potentially paving the way for quantum networks in space and on Earth.This advancement ultimately could result in enhanced security for data transmission between spacecrafts and improved capabilities for quantum computing and sensing applications on Earth.\n\nExplore\n\nACES,a European Space Agency investigation for which BPS is providing ground support and atomic clocks on the ground for comparison, isexpected to launch to the International Space Station in 2025. This experiment will demonstrate a new generation of atomic clocks in the space environment to test Einstein’s theory of general relativity by measuring time with extreme accuracy in space.The ACES network will allow scientists to compare ground clocks at high resolution on a world-wide basis using both microwave and optical links.\n\nExplore\n\nAlthough 100 years have passed since the development of quantum mechanics, much remains unknown about quantum phenomena. Using space as a laboratory, however, has led to scientific breakthroughs that could unlock mysteries of the universe and contribute to new technologies beyond our imagination.\n\nHow this benefits space exploration:\n\nInsights from quantum research could advance humanity’s exploration of space by enabling highly precise measurements of phenomena in space, improving navigation, and enhancing space situational awareness.\n\nHow this benefits humanity:\n\nQuantum research has contributed to technologies used in everyday life, including GPS navigation, medical imaging, cell phones, computers, and more. NASA’s quantum research also advances scientific knowledge, opening up new career pathways and inspiring new generations of physicists.\n\nLearn more about unraveling ​mysteries of the universe​.\n\nNASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences Divisionpioneers scientific discovery and enables exploration by using space environments to conduct investigations not possible on Earth. Studying biological and physical phenomenon under extreme conditions allows researchers to advance the fundamental scientific knowledge required to go farther and stay longer in space, while also benefitting life on Earth.\n\nStay up-to-date with the latest content from NASA as we explore the universe and discover more about our home planet.\n\nOn May 1st and 2nd, the Open Science Data Repository (OSDR) hosted the 2024 AWG Symposium, a virtual event that…\n\nOn Thursday, March 16th, Open Science hosted the 2023 Analysis Working Group (AWG) Symposium from 10 am – 2:30 pm…\n\nOn Thursday, June 30th, GeneLab hosted the 2022 AWG Symposium from 10 am – 2:30 pm PT.

So, imagine if small devices, called organ-chips, which are roughly the size of a credit card or USB drive, could be used to predict how your body might respond to a specific medical treatment.\n\nOrgan-chips are small avatars for human organs.These chips contain cell cultures that model the structures and functions of specific human tissues and organs, such as the lungs, heart, pancreas, and liver. They can also be linked together to mimic entire human systems.\n\nKnown by various names — such as organ-on-a-chip, tissue chips, tissue-on-a-chip, microphysiological systems (MPS), and 3D tissue chips — these devices usually function for about 30 days. However, NASA and other research organizations are working to extend their lifespan to allow scientists to study the longer-term effects of diseases and treatments.\n\nOrgan-chips can be made from adult human cells donated by volunteers and patients. They’recreated from a blood draw, skin cells, or stored cell cultures. These cells are converted to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that can become nearly any type of cell in the human body.\n\nResearchers culture iPSCs in an organ-chip — an engineered environment similar to the human body — to create miniature avatars of the human organ they’re interested in studying.\n\nSinceorgan-chipsare made directly from human cells, they are considered more accurate models for comparing scientific and biomedical data.They can be used to understand how and why the human body adapts to changes in the spaceflight environment and other extreme conditions.\n\nSending organ-chips beyond the protective shield of Earth’sVan Allen Beltsenables researchers to study the effects of extreme stressors, particularly radiation, on human cells without putting humans at risk.\n\nOrgan-chips are being used by NASA and other researchers today — and couldcontribute to big leaps in precision health care, including a deeper understanding of human biology and disease, preventative measures for disease, and personalized therapeutic treatments.\n\nFor example, on Earth, cancer, which has both environmental and genetic components, affects lives around the world and is among the leading causes of death. Researchers are using organ-chips as an essential scientific tool to significantly advance the discovery of how cancer cells originate, grow, and spread.\n\nResearchers and oncologists useorgan-chips today to test new pharmaceutical treatments and understand how a specific patient’s cancer reacts to different treatments.Findings and data from these studies could enable clinicians to tailor cancer treatments to individual patients and decrease the time for screening. These advancements could also reduce secondary effects of the treatments and increase quality of life.\n\nFor NASA,this research could be used to safeguard astronaut health on deep-space missions.The chips can provide insights on how deep-space stressors, including extreme radiation and microgravity, might affect astronauts on an individual level.\n\nAs we go farther and stay longer in space, crew will have limited access to on-site clinical healthcare.

This surface layer on the Moon is fragmented, sharp rock material.\n\nJust like the Earth has soil, the Moon has lunar regolith. But an important difference is that soil is made of organic materials, whereas regolith is the result of the impact of meteoroidsas well as charged particles from the Sun and stars.\n\nWhile the Earth’s soil is exposed to wind and water, which wear down the edges of the particles, the rock material of lunar regolith remains very sharp with fresh fractured surfaces. This makes theregolith potentially dangerous; it can quickly wear down space suits and equipment and be hazardous to astronaut health.\n\nUnderstanding the possible impacts of lunar regolith is critical to enabling humans to explore and stay on the Moon for longer periods of time.As we stay longer on the Moon and eventually go to Mars, we will need to reduce the quantity of supplies launched from Earth and instead produce supplies using the natural resources available.\n\nRegolith is a natural resource of the Moon. Since it is readily available, it could be a convenient resource for producing supplies, building structures, extracting water and gasses, and growing plants to reduce the need to fly the supplies and raw materials from Earth.\n\nIn fact, scientists have already started experimenting withgrowing plants in lunar regolith.After two days, seeds germinated, although the resulting plants did not grow as well as those grown in more nutrient-rich Earth soil. This research advances scientific knowledge in four areas:\n\nAnother potential use for lunar regolith is in building materials. Scientists are working to understand if regolith can be mixed with cement and different binders to make a type of lunar concrete which could be used to build space habitats and other structures. The goal of theMICS (Microgravity Investigation of Cement Solidification) experimentwas to investigate the complex process of cement solidification in microgravity on the International Space Station. The data from this study and other space station concrete solidification studies can inform research investigations to be conducted in the partial gravity of the Moon.\n\nThe investigation of the potential of regolith on the Moon and Mars for manufacturing and life-sustaining applications is vital for a sustained presence.What scientists find today could propel the future of space agriculture, building, and manufacturing in space.\n\nExperiments have taken place aboard the International Space Station to study cement based concrete in microgravity.\n\nNASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences Divisionpioneers scientific discovery and enables exploration by using space environments to conduct investigations not possible on Earth. Studying biological and physical phenomenon under extreme conditions allows researchers to advance the fundamental scientific knowledge required to go farther and stay longer in space, while also benefitting life on Earth.", "ocr_text": "", "media_assets": ["https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/missions/hubble/galaxies/spiral/Hubble_NGC2775_potw2538a.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/esd/eo/content-feature/aerosols/images/aerosol_fine_fraction_depth_201008_hammer.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/acd25-132-006.jpg?w=1024", "https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/ARC-1969-A-16712/ARC-1969-A-16712~large.jpg?w=1920&h=1382&fit=clip&crop=faces%2Cfocalpoint", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/uc-s03-working-file-horizontal-v02-2.png?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/1-pia26662-dsc4667-enhanced-nr.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/taking-in-the-view-surface-from-hls.png?w=1024", "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/themes/nasa-child/assets/images/nasa-logo@2x.png", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/cds/general/images/2023/03/53636962950-44cdcf9882-o.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/jsc2023e006587.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/cds/learn/science-activation-stories/2025/2025-0805-RiversofStarsandStories-30-moonactivity-sm-Brandi_Stewart.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/psd/solar-system/skywatching/2025/october/02_Jupiter%20and%20Saturn_Credit_Preston%20Dyches_CC%20BY-NC%202.0.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/iss070e001252.jpg?w=1024", "https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/AFRC2025-0013-02/AFRC2025-0013-02~large.jpg?w=1919&h=1536&fit=clip&crop=faces%2Cfocalpoint", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/astro/exo-explore/exoplanet-artists-concepts/WISPIT%202%20b%20Wide%20Final.png?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/cds/general/images/2023/09/exoplanetwatch-896.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/cds/general/images/2023/04/m/meatball-1041.jpg?w=1041&h=862&fit=clip&crop=faces%2Cfocalpoint", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/img-3738.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/missions/webb/science/2025/09/STScI-01K6196E18EPYF8RDEAQVA01Y3.png?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/missions/prism/prism-data-cube.png?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/psd/photojournal/pia/pia13/pia13126/PIA13126.tif?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/astro/programs/exep/images/exo.png?w=1024", "https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/6901250/6901250~large.jpg?w=1896&h=1920&fit=clip&crop=faces%2Cfocalpoint", "https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/as11-40-5878/as11-40-5878~large.jpg?w=1912&h=1920&fit=clip&crop=faces%2Cfocalpoint", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/plants_in_soil_from_the_moon.jpg", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/esd/articles/2025/hydroflame_banner.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/afrc2025-0030-83.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/esd/articles/2025/A90%20NASA%20Chesapeake%20Shawn%20Serbin.jpeg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/content/dam/science/astro/programs/physics-of-the-cosmos/images/gwsig/gravitational_waves-16.gif", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/gsfc-20171208-archive-e000760orig-stpatricksaurora-iotd.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/20240131-207a0543.png?w=1024"], "referenced_urls": ["https://science.nasa.gov/biological-physical/data/osdr/\">OSDR</a></li><li"], "provenance": {"parser_path": "external.explainers", "fetched_at": "2025-10-04T03:36:24.357427", "source_type": "html"}}

Scientists with the Cold Atom Lab have pushed the boundaries of fundamental physics, developing valuable quantum expertise that has enabled them to provide strategic insights that inform other NASA missions.\n\nThe Cold Atom Lab creates Bose-Einstein condensates — clouds of atoms cooled to the coldest temperature matter can reach. In microgravity, Bose-Einstein condensates can reach colder temperatures more easily and exist for longer than those created in Earth-based laboratories, giving researchers more opportunities to study them. And scientists don't need to leave Earth to run these ultra-cold experiments on the space station; they control everything from their desks.\n\nThe Cold Atom Lab is also the first space-based facility to use Bose-Einstein condensates in atom interferometry, a technique that uses the wave-like nature of atoms to measure properties of the environment with extraordinary precision. Atom interferometers split atom waves and then recombine them.\n\nImagine dropping two pebbles in a pond and watching how the ripples interact — creating patterns of high waves where they meet and flat spots where they cancel out. Atom interferometers work similarly, but with atoms instead of water. By studying these patterns, scientists can detect tiny changes in gravity that affect how the waves interact.\n\nIn the microgravity environment of space, the atoms experience longer freefall times, which makes subsequent measurements of their interactions more precise. Scientists with the Cold Atom Lab are working toward using space-based atom interferometry to measure gravity in space. Future missions could use this technique to track the movement of water on Earth, study the composition of other planets and moons from orbit, and improve spacecraft navigation.\n\nThe Cold Atom Lab team's expertise has helped pave the way forthe start of the Earth Science Technology Office’s Quantum Gravity Gradiometer (QGG) pathfinderproject.\n\nThe QGG is a technology demonstration instrument, sponsored by NASA’s Earth Science Technology Office (ESTO) that will use advanced atom interferometry to test technologies needed to measure Earth's gravitational fields from space with unprecedented accuracy. Like a quantum stethoscope, the QGG instrument will be able to detect the gravitational \"heartbeat\" of matter moving beneath Earth's surface by measuring tiny changes in the pull of gravity.\n\nQuantum-sensing capabilities like those in QGG could help scientists:\n\nThe quantum expertise developed through the Cold Atom Lab provides a strong technical foundation for QGG and future missions.

The U.S. is currently the only nation with a continuously operating quantum physics facility in space. The expertise developed for the Cold Atom Lab has created a unique team of quantum specialists who can now support a variety of NASA's scientific and exploration goals.\n\nThe project has also strengthened U.S. commercial and academic capabilities in quantum technologies. Work on the Cold Atom Lab has advanced quantum technology development in both industry and academia. Small businesses and university spinoffs that developed components for the lab have enhanced their technical capabilities. These vendors improved their laser systems, experimental apparatus, and other components that now have potential applications beyond NASA missions.\n\nAs quantum technologies advance, the specialized teams assembled by NASA are paving the way for future missions.

These states take on forms that are easily observable, whether it’s a coffee mug, the coffee inside it, or the steam rising from it. And you may also know the fourth state of matter: plasma, which is found in sources like lightning, neon bulbs, and stars, including the Sun.\n\nIn 1995, researchers made the ground-breaking discovery that there is a fifth state of matter: Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs). Essentially, BECs are formed when particles are cooled to near absolute zero, causing them to coalesce into a single quantum object that acts as a wave in a relatively large packet.\n\nAlthough difficult to even create on Earth, BECs are now formed in space to enable scientists to study the nature of matter at the smallest (quantum) scale and make important technological advancements.  BECs enable scientists to manipulate a quantum system on a macroscopic scale, enabling a variety of experiments not possible on the microscopic scale.\n\nBy studying how identical BECs behave together as a wave — rendering them visible to ultra-sensitive cameras — scientists are able to gain valuable information about single atoms and subatomic particles where the wave-nature isn’t directly observable.\n\nBEC research can lead to more precise sensors, fundamental insights into nature and our universe, and offers the potential for developing and studying new materials, among many other uses.\n\nIn fact, quantum research has contributed to technologies that touch our everyday lives — things like lasers, cell phones, computers, GPS navigation systems, and MRI scanners for medical imaging. Over a century ago, when scientists first theorized the fifth state of matter, these inventions were the fodder of science fiction. Similarly, continuing to push the boundaries of quantum discovery could contribute to future advancements beyond our wildest imaginations.\n\nA (brief) history of the fifth state of matter\n\nBose-Einstein Condensates are named after physicists Satyendra Nath Bose and Albert Einstein, who predicted the condensates in the 1920s.\n\nIn 1995, physicists Eric Cornell at the National Institute of Standards & Technology and Carl Wieman at the University of Colorado at Boulder created the first BEC in a gas of rubidium atoms, and shortly thereafter, Wolfgang Ketterle at MIT produced a BEC in a gas of sodium atoms. Collectively, this is considered the official discovery of the fifth state of matter.\n\nQuantum and the Cold Atom Lab\n\nToday, scientists with NASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences Division (BPS) conductquantum scienceout of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. These researchers use the space environment to explore the strange world of quantum mechanics in ways not possible on Earth and, since 2018, have been producing BECs almost daily in space using theCold Atom Laboratory(CAL) aboard the International Space Station.\n\nIn CAL, atoms are cooled to within a fraction of a degree above absolute zero. These cold atoms move slowly and are therefore easier to study than here on Earth. Also, in the microgravity environment of space, BECs can float, which extends our observation time of them.\n\nQuantum research enables us to learn more about the fundamental nature of matter, which can provide a greater understanding of how the universe works at the smallest scale. This knowledge could provide a new foundation for future generations of scientists and engineers to innovate from, advance space exploration, and benefit life on Earth.\n\nRelated Information:\n\nHouston We Have a Podcast: The Coolest Experiment in the Universe\n\nNASA's Cold Atom Lab Takes One Giant Leap for Quantum Science\n\nWorld Quantum Day", "ocr_text": "", "media_assets": ["https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/missions/hubble/galaxies/spiral/Hubble_NGC2775_potw2538a.jpg?w=1024", "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/fifth-state-of-matter.jpg", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/esd/eo/content-feature/aerosols/images/aerosol_fine_fraction_depth_201008_hammer.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/acd25-132-006.jpg?w=1024", "https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/ARC-1969-A-16712/ARC-1969-A-16712~large.jpg?w=1920&h=1382&fit=clip&crop=faces%2Cfocalpoint", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/uc-s03-working-file-horizontal-v02-2.png?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/1-pia26662-dsc4667-enhanced-nr.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/taking-in-the-view-surface-from-hls.png?w=1024", "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/themes/nasa-child/assets/images/nasa-logo@2x.png", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/cds/general/images/2023/03/53636962950-44cdcf9882-o.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/jsc2023e006587.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/cds/learn/science-activation-stories/2025/2025-0805-RiversofStarsandStories-30-moonactivity-sm-Brandi_Stewart.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/psd/solar-system/skywatching/2025/october/02_Jupiter%20and%20Saturn_Credit_Preston%20Dyches_CC%20BY-NC%202.0.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/iss070e001252.jpg?w=1024", "https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/AFRC2025-0013-02/AFRC2025-0013-02~large.jpg?w=1919&h=1536&fit=clip&crop=faces%2Cfocalpoint", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/astro/exo-explore/exoplanet-artists-concepts/WISPIT%202%20b%20Wide%20Final.png?w=1024", "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/fifth-state-of-matter.jpg?w=2048", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/cds/general/images/2023/09/exoplanetwatch-896.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/img-3738.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/missions/webb/science/2025/09/STScI-01K6196E18EPYF8RDEAQVA01Y3.png?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/missions/prism/prism-data-cube.png?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/psd/photojournal/pia/pia13/pia13126/PIA13126.tif?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/astro/programs/exep/images/exo.png?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/esd/articles/2025/hydroflame_banner.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/afrc2025-0030-83.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/esd/articles/2025/A90%20NASA%20Chesapeake%20Shawn%20Serbin.jpeg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/content/dam/science/astro/programs/physics-of-the-cosmos/images/gwsig/gravitational_waves-16.gif", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/gsfc-20171208-archive-e000760orig-stpatricksaurora-iotd.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/20240131-207a0543.png?w=1024"], "referenced_urls": [], "provenance": {"parser_path": "external.explainers", "fetched_at": "2025-10-04T03:36:24.467838", "source_type": "html"}}

It could also serve as a source of food and be used to produce biologics, such as medicines, in space.  That’s why researchers sought to identify which strains of algae would not just survive, but thrive, in the harsh conditions of deep space.\n\nFor the experiment, researchers inserted a tardigrade gene into algal cells using short pulses of electricity. Tardigrades are known as water bears because they resemble miniature bears under a microscope, The gene calledDsup(short for Damage suppressor)allows tardigrades to withstand environmental conditions on Earth that are harmful to other forms of life. This enabled the researchers to test whether the gene that helps tardigrades survive harsh environments on Earth can protect algal cells as well.\n\nResults from “Fuel to Mars” suggest that the green alga used in Artemis I, might make the best traveling companion on future missions. Samples from the study revealed a “population survival response,” where the space environment, including the galactic cosmic radiation field, potentially stimulated, rather than impeded, algae survival.\n\nAnother observation from the research is thatChlamydomonas,even without the tardigrade gene, may have their own strategy to survive harmful conditions of the space environment. The researchers found that someChlamydomonascells on the Artemis I flight produced more carotenoids, a type of pigment that gives vegetables and fruits their brilliant colors.\n\nAntioxidant properties of carotenoids are known to provide protection from stress and could partly explain why some algal cells were better protected than others when exposed to galactic cosmic radiation.\n\nThe Artemis I experiment also included a successful technology demonstration of scientific hardware, known as Moonshot. It provided light cycles to maintain algal cell growth and conducted measurements of the environment throughout the journey around the Moon.\n\nScientists plan to apply these findings for the benefit of both astronauts and citizens. In addition to informing which resources to send on future Moon and Mars missions, this research could also advance radiation therapies for treatments on Earth.\n\nLearn More:\n\nAbout BPS\n\nNASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences Divisionpioneers scientific discovery and enables exploration by using space environments to conduct investigations not possible on Earth. Studying biological and physical phenomenon under extreme conditions allows researchers to advance the fundamental scientific knowledge required to go farther and stay longer in space, while also benefitting life on Earth.", "ocr_text": "", "media_assets": ["https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/missions/hubble/galaxies/spiral/Hubble_NGC2775_potw2538a.jpg?w=1024", "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/cs-04.png?w=1494", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/esd/eo/content-feature/aerosols/images/aerosol_fine_fraction_depth_201008_hammer.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/acd25-132-006.jpg?w=1024", "https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/ARC-1969-A-16712/ARC-1969-A-16712~large.jpg?w=1920&h=1382&fit=clip&crop=faces%2Cfocalpoint", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/uc-s03-working-file-horizontal-v02-2.png?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/1-pia26662-dsc4667-enhanced-nr.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/taking-in-the-view-surface-from-hls.png?w=1024", "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/themes/nasa-child/assets/images/nasa-logo@2x.png", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/cds/general/images/2023/03/53636962950-44cdcf9882-o.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/jsc2023e006587.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/cds/learn/science-activation-stories/2025/2025-0805-RiversofStarsandStories-30-moonactivity-sm-Brandi_Stewart.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/psd/solar-system/skywatching/2025/october/02_Jupiter%20and%20Saturn_Credit_Preston%20Dyches_CC%20BY-NC%202.0.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/iss070e001252.jpg?w=1024", "https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/AFRC2025-0013-02/AFRC2025-0013-02~large.jpg?w=1919&h=1536&fit=clip&crop=faces%2Cfocalpoint", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/astro/exo-explore/exoplanet-artists-concepts/WISPIT%202%20b%20Wide%20Final.png?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/cds/general/images/2023/09/exoplanetwatch-896.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/img-3738.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/missions/webb/science/2025/09/STScI-01K6196E18EPYF8RDEAQVA01Y3.png?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/missions/prism/prism-data-cube.png?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/psd/photojournal/pia/pia13/pia13126/PIA13126.tif?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/astro/programs/exep/images/exo.png?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/esd/articles/2025/hydroflame_banner.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/afrc2025-0030-83.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/esd/articles/2025/A90%20NASA%20Chesapeake%20Shawn%20Serbin.jpeg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/content/dam/science/astro/programs/physics-of-the-cosmos/images/gwsig/gravitational_waves-16.gif", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/gsfc-20171208-archive-e000760orig-stpatricksaurora-iotd.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/20240131-207a0543.png?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/bps/space-crops/chlamydomonas-reinhardtii-colored.jpg?w=480&h=270&fit=clip&crop=faces%2Cfocalpoint", "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/cs-04.png"], "referenced_urls": [], "provenance": {"parser_path": "external.explainers", "fetched_at": "2025-10-04T03:36:24.514056", "source_type": "html"}}

These experiments, many of which are sponsored by NASA’sBiological and Physical Sciences (BPS) Division, are improving our understanding of combustion and the safety of future deep space explorers.\n\nWhen you remove Earth’s gravitational pull, flames behave much differently. The typical shape of a candle flame is caused by less dense warm air rising to be replaced by cooler ambient air from below. In microgravity, however, that circulation effect does not happen, creating a spherical flame!\n\nGravity is a strong force that can cloud scientific studies on Earth. Studying combustion in microgravity provides a unique opportunity for scientists to better understand the fundamental aspects of combustion without that clouding effect of gravity.\n\nAdditionally, researchers study fire in space to better protect astronauts. Astronauts must know what to expect in case of a fire emergency. Unlike on Earth, Astronauts cannot leave the spacecraft and dial 911. The spacecraft environment must be made as safe as possible by using materials that do not burn whenever possible. Some materials may even be more flammable in partial-gravity environments, making this research crucial.\n\nResearchers have designed International Space Station facilities to study combustion while keeping crew safe during the tests. The primary facility used to study flames aboard station is the Combustion Integrated Rack (CIR). CIR safely contains small-scale flame studies and requires little crew interaction.\n\nThe BPS-sponsored Solid Fuel Ignition and Extinction (SoFIE) experiment is designed to slot into the CIR and enables studies of ignition and the flammability of solid spacecraft materials.\n\nLarger scale flame studies have been conducted aboard Northrop Grumman Cygnus spacecraft after they depart station. ThisSaffireseries of experiments allowed for scaled-up studies of fire spread.\n\nAfter decades of space combustion research, researchers have made great progress so far.\n\nWith humanity heading back to the Moon as a part of the Artemis program, studying flames in true lunar gravity is important for crew safety. Tests will help us understand how to better design our habitats, and which materials to avoid which may be more flammable in an environment with less gravity.\n\nThe Flammability of Materials on the Moon (FM2) study will be the first flammability test on another world. The experiment will be conducted on the lunar surface to evaluate flame size, strength, intensity and spread compared to Earth gravity.\n\nRelated Resources\n\nAbout BPS\n\nNASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences Divisionpioneers scientific discovery and enables exploration by using space environments to conduct investigations not possible on Earth. Studying biological and physical phenomenon under extreme conditions allows researchers to advance the fundamental scientific knowledge required to go farther and stay longer in space, while also benefitting life on Earth.", "ocr_text": "", "media_assets": ["https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/missions/hubble/galaxies/spiral/Hubble_NGC2775_potw2538a.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/esd/eo/content-feature/aerosols/images/aerosol_fine_fraction_depth_201008_hammer.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/acd25-132-006.jpg?w=1024", "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/jsc2023e002281orig.jpg", "https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/ARC-1969-A-16712/ARC-1969-A-16712~large.jpg?w=1920&h=1382&fit=clip&crop=faces%2Cfocalpoint", "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/iss049e003808medium.jpg?w=1279", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/uc-s03-working-file-horizontal-v02-2.png?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/1-pia26662-dsc4667-enhanced-nr.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/taking-in-the-view-surface-from-hls.png?w=1024", "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/jsc2023e046631small.jpg?w=640", "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/themes/nasa-child/assets/images/nasa-logo@2x.png", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/cds/general/images/2023/03/53636962950-44cdcf9882-o.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/jsc2023e006587.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/cds/learn/science-activation-stories/2025/2025-0805-RiversofStarsandStories-30-moonactivity-sm-Brandi_Stewart.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/psd/solar-system/skywatching/2025/october/02_Jupiter%20and%20Saturn_Credit_Preston%20Dyches_CC%20BY-NC%202.0.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/iss070e001252.jpg?w=1024", "https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/AFRC2025-0013-02/AFRC2025-0013-02~large.jpg?w=1919&h=1536&fit=clip&crop=faces%2Cfocalpoint", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/astro/exo-explore/exoplanet-artists-concepts/WISPIT%202%20b%20Wide%20Final.png?w=1024", "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/jsc2023e013681medium.jpg", "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/jsc2023e046631small.jpg", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/cds/general/images/2023/09/exoplanetwatch-896.jpg?w=1024", "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/jsc2023e002281orig.jpg?w=994", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/img-3738.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/missions/webb/science/2025/09/STScI-01K6196E18EPYF8RDEAQVA01Y3.png?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/missions/prism/prism-data-cube.png?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/psd/photojournal/pia/pia13/pia13126/PIA13126.tif?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/astro/programs/exep/images/exo.png?w=1024", "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/iss049e003808medium.jpg", "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/candle-comparison.webp", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/esd/articles/2025/hydroflame_banner.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/afrc2025-0030-83.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/esd/articles/2025/A90%20NASA%20Chesapeake%20Shawn%20Serbin.jpeg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/content/dam/science/astro/programs/physics-of-the-cosmos/images/gwsig/gravitational_waves-16.gif", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/gsfc-20171208-archive-e000760orig-stpatricksaurora-iotd.jpg?w=1024", "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/jsc2023e013681medium.jpg?w=1280", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/20240131-207a0543.png?w=1024"], "referenced_urls": ["https://science.nasa.gov/biological-physical/data/osdr/\">OSDR</a></li><li"], "provenance": {"parser_path": "external.explainers", "fetched_at": "2025-10-04T03:36:24.563891", "source_type": "html"}}

You’re lucky if you find them, but you can’t make it happen on command.\n\nThese strange materials break all the rules of how crystals are supposed to work, and discovering them has largely been a matter of chance.\n\nNow, NASA-funded researchers have figured out how to grow these mysterious structures. Scientists can deliberately grow quasicrystals and watch every step of the process happen in real time under a microscope.\n\nImagine building with toy blocks, but instead of using regular bricks that create simple, repeating grids, you're working with special pieces that form incredibly organized patterns that never perfectly repeat. That's essentially what quasicrystals are — materials where atoms arrange themselves in highly ordered but non-repeating patterns.\n\nTraditional crystals look identical when rotated at certain angles, and they can only have particular “symmetries” like 2-fold, 4-fold or 6-fold (like how a square looks the same 4 times as you spin it around). Quasicrystals can have 5-fold, 8-fold, 10-fold, or even 12-fold symmetries that scientists once thought were impossible.\n\nThis strange structure is what makes quasicrystals promising for advanced applications.\n\nProfessor David Marr and his team at Colorado School of Mines cracked a decades-long puzzle. Using funding from a NASA grant, they developed a method to grow dodecagonal quasicrystals — structures with 12-fold symmetry — by manipulating tiny particles with magnetic and electric fields. For the first time, they could watch the entire quasicrystal assembly process happen live under an optical microscope.\n\nThe breakthrough came through their work on the Advanced Colloids Experiment with Temperature Control (ACE-T9). With this development, researchers on Earth could essentially turn a dial to control how fast intricate quasicrystal patterns formed. Instead of relying on luck or chance discoveries, they now have a systematic way to guide particles into these complex, non-repeating arrangements. This could offer a new blueprint for creating advanced materials with quasicrystals.\n\nWhat makes this breakthrough particularly exciting is the level of control the team achieved. Previous quasicrystal discoveries were largely accidental, but now scientists have a systematic approach to creating and studying these materials. That shift from chance discoveries to deliberate creation could be what brings quasicrystal applications from the laboratory into everyday use.\n\nProfessor Marr’s research earned a featured spot on the cover of the scientific journal Nature Physics.\n\nQuasicrystals could potentially solve some serious engineering challenges. In space, materials that can self-assemble might reduce the need for complex construction projects on satellites or habitats. The unique way quasicrystals interact with light could also lead to revolutionary sensor technologies for space exploration missions.\n\nEarth-based applications are equally promising. Researchers believe controlled quasicrystal formation might enable ultra-efficient solar cells, advanced optical devices, or breakthrough manufacturing techniques. The aerospace industry could see benefits from stronger, lighter materials, while other sectors might develop improved materials for robotics or filtration systems.\n\nMaterials Science at NASA’s Division of Biological and Physical Sciences (BPS)\n\nWhat BPS Studies\n\nBiological and Physical Sciences Data\n\nNASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences Divisionpioneers scientific discovery and enables exploration by using space environments to conduct investigations not possible on Earth.

This research not only advances space exploration technology, but also improves our lives on Earth.\n\nUnderstanding Soft Matter\n\nSoft matter encompasses a fascinating family of materials: colloidal systems, liquid crystals, foams, gels, emulsions, and granular materials. What makes them special is their unique ability to respond and reorganize when exposed to small forces like temperature changes or gravity. Think of silly putty that flows like a liquid but bounces like a solid: that’s soft matter in action.\n\nUnlike traditional materials like steel or glass, soft matter can seamlessly transition between three distinct phases: liquid-solid, liquid-liquid, and liquid-gas. In the microgravity environment of space, scientists can observe these transitions without Earth's gravity masking subtle but important behaviors.\n\nStudying the novel behaviors of these flexible materials in space is revolutionizing our understanding of fundamental physics and opening new doors in materials science and biotechnology.\n\nFrom Space to Your Daily Life\n\nFrom shaving cream lather to fire-suppressing foams, bubble-laden liquids are a common and important material that we utilize on Earth. But studying the behavior and stability of foams is difficult to do given Earth’s gravitational pull. That’s where NASA comes in.\n\nBy studying these “squishy” materials in space, NASA isn’t just advancing fundamental physics — it’s improving products we use every. So far, studies of colloidal systems — which include substances like blood, paint, and fire retardants — have led to five new commercial patents, extended shelf life for household products, and improved manufacturing processes in space and on Earth.\n\nThe International Space Station'sFoam Optics and Mechanics (FOAM)investigation revealed fascinating insights impossible to obtain on Earth. In microgravity, wet foams maintain their structure instead of draining liquid — a common problem in Earth-based studies. Using advanced light-scattering technology and high-precision imaging, scientists observed foam in its purest form.\n\nThis research extends far beyond academic interest.

While they may sound similar, they are quite different in what they do. What they do have in common is their ability to help us understand how life functions on Earth and in the Universe.\n\nAstrobiology is the study of the origin, evolution, and distribution of life in the Universe1. The hunt for extraterrestrial life might sound like something out of the science-fiction genre, but scientific logic guides this search.\n\nFor NASA scientists, the search to understand life in the Universe starts on Earth. Understanding how life evolved on Earth and what steps made it possible are key to understanding what life might exist outside of it.\n\nTo guide us in our search for life beyond Earth, scientists are studying how life on Earth exists in extreme environments like the scorching hot desert or the freezing Arctic tundra. In our solar system, environments like these can be found on Mars or the icy moons2around Saturn and Jupiter. Future Astrobiology missions will study if these environments in space harbor life.\n\nIn space, tools like robotic science rovers can help scientists search for some of the biosignatures — or signs of life. During the Mars 2020 mission, the rover Perseverance collected data that could be used to look for signs of ancient microbial life3. The rover also collected a suite of samples that a future Mars Sample Return mission will be able to bring back to Earth for study, with all the sophistication and thoroughness of Earth-based instrumentation.\n\nUnderstanding both how life emerged and evolved on Earth and what the limits are to life as we know it guides NASA in its mission to search for life elsewhere in the Universe. Astrobiology strives to answer the question: “Are we alone?”\n\nFor more information, follow NASA’sAstrobiology Programon Twitter at @NASAAstrobio.\n\nSpace Biology\n\nSpace Biology is the study of howthespaceflight environment — such as ionizing radiation, microgravity, isolation, and altered atmosphere — affects life. Studying how living things respond at a fundamental level to these extreme conditions can inform what’s needed to ensure crew health on deep space missions and contribute to biomedical and agricultural advancements on Earth.\n\nThe main objective of NASA’s Space Biology research is to better understand how spaceflight affects living systems in spacecraft, such as the International Space Station, as well as in deep space, on planetary surfaces, or in ground-based experiments that mimic aspects of spaceflight.\n\nThe experiments NASA conducts on these platforms examine how plants, microbes, and model organisms (such as fruit flies, worms, and rodents) adjust or adapt to living in space. Researchers examine metabolism, growth, stress responses, physiology, and developmental processes.\n\nThey study how organisms repair cellular damage and protect themselves from infection and disease in microgravity conditions while also exposed to space radiation. And they do it across the spectrum of biological organization, from molecules to cells, tissues, organs and systems to whole organisms, communities, and ecosystems.\n\nAnother focus of Space Biology is plant biology. Since space is limited aboard spacecraft, astronauts will need access to sustainable, nutritious sources of food for long-term stays in space.\n\nLimited water supplies, microgravity, and different atmospheric and light conditions can affect plant health. Understanding how plants grow in the harsh conditions of space can help scientists determine which ones are most suitable for becoming “space crops.” Research in this field has already contributed to agricultural advancements on Earth, including hydroponic, aeroponic, and vertical farming.\n\nTo learn more about how NASA’sBiological and Physical Sciences Divisionpioneers scientific discovery, follow us on Twitter at @NASASpaceSci.\n\nSummary\n\nAstrobiology focuses on the origins, evolution, and the limits to life on Earth to understand where and how to search for life in space. Space Biology studies how Earthly life responds to space environmental conditions to further our understanding of how life operates in built environments for space exploration.\n\nNASA’s research in both fields has contributed to scientific knowledge, biomedical and technological innovations, and agricultural advancements that benefit both space exploration and terrestrial life.\n\n1https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/about/2https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/news/icy-moons-and-their-plumes/3https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/missions/2020-mars-rover/", "ocr_text": "", "media_assets": ["https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/missions/hubble/galaxies/spiral/Hubble_NGC2775_potw2538a.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/esd/eo/content-feature/aerosols/images/aerosol_fine_fraction_depth_201008_hammer.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/acd25-132-006.jpg?w=1024", "https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/ARC-1969-A-16712/ARC-1969-A-16712~large.jpg?w=1920&h=1382&fit=clip&crop=faces%2Cfocalpoint", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/uc-s03-working-file-horizontal-v02-2.png?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/1-pia26662-dsc4667-enhanced-nr.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/taking-in-the-view-surface-from-hls.png?w=1024", "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/space-bio-astrobio.png", "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/themes/nasa-child/assets/images/nasa-logo@2x.png", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/cds/general/images/2023/03/53636962950-44cdcf9882-o.jpg?w=1024", "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/space-biology-astrobiology2.png?w=1578", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/jsc2023e006587.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/cds/learn/science-activation-stories/2025/2025-0805-RiversofStarsandStories-30-moonactivity-sm-Brandi_Stewart.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/psd/solar-system/skywatching/2025/october/02_Jupiter%20and%20Saturn_Credit_Preston%20Dyches_CC%20BY-NC%202.0.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/iss070e001252.jpg?w=1024", "https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/AFRC2025-0013-02/AFRC2025-0013-02~large.jpg?w=1919&h=1536&fit=clip&crop=faces%2Cfocalpoint", "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/space-biology-astrobiology.jpg?w=789", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/astro/exo-explore/exoplanet-artists-concepts/WISPIT%202%20b%20Wide%20Final.png?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/cds/general/images/2023/09/exoplanetwatch-896.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/img-3738.jpg?w=1024", "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/space-biology-astrobiology.jpg", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/missions/webb/science/2025/09/STScI-01K6196E18EPYF8RDEAQVA01Y3.png?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/missions/prism/prism-data-cube.png?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/psd/photojournal/pia/pia13/pia13126/PIA13126.tif?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/astro/programs/exep/images/exo.png?w=1024", "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/space-biology-astrobiology2.png", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/esd/articles/2025/hydroflame_banner.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/afrc2025-0030-83.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/esd/articles/2025/A90%20NASA%20Chesapeake%20Shawn%20Serbin.jpeg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/content/dam/science/astro/programs/physics-of-the-cosmos/images/gwsig/gravitational_waves-16.gif", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/gsfc-20171208-archive-e000760orig-stpatricksaurora-iotd.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/20240131-207a0543.png?w=1024", "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/space-bio-astrobio.png?w=1806"], "referenced_urls": ["https://science.nasa.gov/biological-physical/data/osdr/\">OSDR</a></li><li"], "provenance": {"parser_path": "external.explainers", "fetched_at": "2025-10-04T03:36:24.821476", "source_type": "html"}}

Muscles develop to push against the force of gravity. Sports rely on balls being pulled back to Earth. Cyclists fight against it to climb mountains.\n\nWhat if we didn’t have to contend with gravity? And what can we learn by studying phenomena unencumbered by it? That’s what NASA researchers aim to find out.\n\nRemoving the effects of gravity can enable researchers to answer important scientific questions and study how humans can safely stay longer in space. For example, the shape of flames on Earth is formed by heated, less dense air rising, which is due to gravity. In space, flamesburn as spheres. To better understand the core principles of combustion on Earth and learn how to keep crews safe on deep space missions, NASA’sBiological and Physical Sciences (BPS) Divisionstudies flames in microgravity. While the International Space Station provides a platform for long-duration microgravity studies, BPS scientists can also simulate short-term microgravity on Earth.\n\nAlthough platforms like the space station have made long-duration microgravity accessible, launching research into orbit still takes a significant investment of time and money. Researchers often only have one shot at success and not much control over the study once it is loaded onto the rocket.\n\nSimulating microgravity on Earth is much lower cost and risk. Researchers can easily perform many versions of an experiment and be more hands on with the work, enabling them to gather data quickly.\n\nWhile simulated microgravity can only last for a short time and does not perfectly replicate the space environment, it is a great testing grounds for studies that might later fly aboard the International Space Station. Experiments can be refined on Earth before committing to launching it to the orbiting laboratory. For example, the BPS-sponsoredRing Sheared Dropinvestigation, which studies amyloids and fibrils associated with diseases such as Alzheimer’s,used parabolic flightsto test its equipment before launching the experiment to station.\n\nImportant tools for simulating microgravity close to Earth include drop towers, parabolic flights, and suborbital flights.\n\nTime in microgravity: ~5 seconds\n\nThese ground-basedTowerssupport the dropping of experiments with low drag from air, due to creating a vacuum in the tower before the drop and enable a few seconds of microgravity.\n\nTheseplane flights— also known as “vomit comets” — follow a steep up and down pattern, creating a microgravity environment at the top of the hills of the flight. This is the same effect as when a rider temporarily feels weightless on a roller coaster and is experiencing reduced gravity.\n\nTime in microgravity: 3-4 minutes\n\nRocketscarrying science experiments follow the same parabola as the airplane, but because they fly much higher, the microgravity time is extended.\n\nNASA employs a variety of microgravity platforms to advance scientific research efficiently and cost-effectively.\n\nThere is, however, no substitute for launching research to space. Space stations allow for “unlimited” access to microgravity, which enables researchers to study phenomena for longer periods of time and gather critical data that could lead to transformational discoveries. Together, these research platforms ensure NASA possesses the information needed to go farther and stay longer in deep space.\n\nWhy Do Science in Microgravity?\n\nParabolic Flights Advance Space Technologies for Gesture Control, Propellant Gauging, and Mars Sample Return Capabilities\n\n5 Hazards of Human Spaceflight\n\nNASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences Divisionpioneers scientific discovery and enables exploration by using space environments to conduct investigations not possible on Earth. Studying biological and physical phenomenon under extreme conditions allows researchers to advance the fundamental scientific knowledge required to go farther and stay longer in space, while also benefitting life on Earth.", "ocr_text": "", "media_assets": ["https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/missions/hubble/galaxies/spiral/Hubble_NGC2775_potw2538a.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/esd/eo/content-feature/aerosols/images/aerosol_fine_fraction_depth_201008_hammer.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/acd25-132-006.jpg?w=1024", "https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/ARC-1969-A-16712/ARC-1969-A-16712~large.jpg?w=1920&h=1382&fit=clip&crop=faces%2Cfocalpoint", "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/jsc2023e002281orig.jpg", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/uc-s03-working-file-horizontal-v02-2.png?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/1-pia26662-dsc4667-enhanced-nr.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/taking-in-the-view-surface-from-hls.png?w=1024", "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/parabolic-flight-ring-shear-team-20210429-steve-boxall-zero-g-research-fll-zg535-flight-7461-high-res.jpg?w=2048", "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/suborbital-rocket-ksc-2013-2810orig.jpg", "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/themes/nasa-child/assets/images/nasa-logo@2x.png", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/cds/general/images/2023/03/53636962950-44cdcf9882-o.jpg?w=1024", "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/parabolic-flight-ring-shear-team-20210429-steve-boxall-zero-g-research-fll-zg535-flight-7461-high-res.jpg", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/jsc2023e006587.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/cds/learn/science-activation-stories/2025/2025-0805-RiversofStarsandStories-30-moonactivity-sm-Brandi_Stewart.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/psd/solar-system/skywatching/2025/october/02_Jupiter%20and%20Saturn_Credit_Preston%20Dyches_CC%20BY-NC%202.0.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/iss070e001252.jpg?w=1024", "https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/AFRC2025-0013-02/AFRC2025-0013-02~large.jpg?w=1919&h=1536&fit=clip&crop=faces%2Cfocalpoint", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/astro/exo-explore/exoplanet-artists-concepts/WISPIT%202%20b%20Wide%20Final.png?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/cds/general/images/2023/09/exoplanetwatch-896.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/img-3738.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/missions/webb/science/2025/09/STScI-01K6196E18EPYF8RDEAQVA01Y3.png?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/missions/prism/prism-data-cube.png?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/psd/photojournal/pia/pia13/pia13126/PIA13126.tif?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/astro/programs/exep/images/exo.png?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/esd/articles/2025/hydroflame_banner.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/afrc2025-0030-83.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/esd/articles/2025/A90%20NASA%20Chesapeake%20Shawn%20Serbin.jpeg?w=1024", "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/suborbital-rocket-ksc-2013-2810orig.jpg?w=1365", "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/grc-1966-c-03681orig.jpg", "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/grc-1966-c-03681orig.jpg?w=2048", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/content/dam/science/astro/programs/physics-of-the-cosmos/images/gwsig/gravitational_waves-16.gif", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/gsfc-20171208-archive-e000760orig-stpatricksaurora-iotd.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/20240131-207a0543.png?w=1024", "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/jsc2023e002281orig.jpg?w=994"], "referenced_urls": [], "provenance": {"parser_path": "external.explainers", "fetched_at": "2025-10-04T03:36:24.868837", "source_type": "html"}}
