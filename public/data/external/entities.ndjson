These missions will help pioneer scientific discovery beyond theVan Allen belts.\n\nVariables in space, likemicrogravityorionizing radiation, are different than they are on Earth. For example, the Moon has only ⅙ of Earth’s gravity and a much thinner atmosphere, which experiences more intense radiation. These differences affect living organisms, including plants.\n\nUnderstanding these differences is vital to helping astronauts go farther and stay longer in space.\n\nSeveral biological life forms, including plant seeds, flew aboard the Artemis I mission.\n\nArtemis I was an uncrewed test flight of the Space Launch System (SLS) and the Orion spacecraft, which flew around the Moon. The primary goals for the test flight were to demonstrate Orion’s systems and thus ensure a safe journey to the Moon and back for the first crewed flight on Artemis II.1\n\nThe Orion spacecraft had plant seeds on board. These seeds had been modified to hold increased nutrients. Since spaceflight can strip seeds of their nutrient reserves, the goal of this experiment was to see if modifications could preserve the nutritional value of the seeds. The seeds in question had increased levels of branched-chain amino acids, which are essential to humans and can only be obtained from plants.2\n\nBeyond researching how to make seeds hardier for space travel, scientists also want to understand how to grow plants in space.\n\nGrowing plants in space is very different from growing them on Earth. In space, water “floats” and the supply of it is limited. The angles and hours of sunshine are different, and so is the circadian rhythm. Research is vital to overcoming these challenges, and to making it possible for plants to be grown on missions.\n\nThe Artemis I mission was the precursor to Artemis II and Artemis III. During the Artemis II mission, astronauts will orbit the Moon. The Artemis III mission will enable astronauts to land on the Moon and eventually establish a basecamp.3\n\nEventually, these pathfinding missions on the Moon will help enable Mars exploration.\n\nMissions to Mars could take months each way, and given the limited room aboard the spacecraft, the crew will only be able to bring limited supplies. Many supplies — like food — will need to be made instead of taken.\n\nUnderstanding how to adapt plants for environments in space is crucial for supporting these crewed Artemis missions. Scientists will need to understand what plants will still provide astronauts with nutritional benefits, and what food can be grown in space. Eventually certain plants could even be identified as viable future space crops.\n\nThis research could contribute to agricultural innovations that benefit humanity. Learning more about what makes plants thrive in the extreme conditions of space could also enable us to grow hardier and more nutritional crops in harsh environments on Earth.\n\n1https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/biological-physical/around-the-moon-and-back-a-test-drive-for-science\n\n2https://science.nasa.gov/biological-physical/investigations/life-beyond-earth\n\n3https://www.nasa.gov/specials/artemis/\n\nWebb is the premier observatory of the next decade, serving thousands of astronomers worldwide.

People have always tried to leave the world a better place for future generations.” - unknown\n\nOne of the largest hazards for astronauts traveling to Mars will be overcoming exposure to high energy radiation from the solar wind, solar storms, and galactic cosmic rays that originate outside of our solar system. This radiation is more damaging to humans than medical X-rays used to see broken bones or treat cancer.\n\nThe Earth’s magnetosphere traps the high energy radiation particles and shields the Earth from the solar storms and the constantly streaming solar wind that can damage technology as well as people living on Earth.\n\nThese trapped particles form two belts of radiation, known as the Van Allen Belts, that surround the Earth like enormous donuts1. The outer belt is made up of billions of high-energy particles that originate from the Sun and the inner belt results from interactions of cosmic rays with Earth’s atmosphere.\n\nAstronauts must fly though the Van Allen Belts to reach outer space, so it is important to fly through this region quickly to limit their exposure to radiation. Sensitive electronics on satellites and space craft traveling through the Van Allen Belts also need to be protected from the radiation.\n\nLocated beyond low-Earth orbit, these radiation belts were discovered in 1958 by astrophysicist James Van Allen who helped uncover the key to enabling exploration of the outer solar system. Van Allen calculated that it was possible to fly through the weaker regions of radiation to reach outer space.\n\nIn 1968, NASA’s Apollo Mission 8 was the first crewed spaceship to fly beyond the Van Allen belts to orbit the Moon and then return to Earth. The most recent time humans have set foot on the Moon or traveled beyond low-Earth orbit was in 1972, during the final mission of the Apollo program, Apollo 17.\n\nWhen the International Space Station was completed in 2011, its low-Earth orbit made it safer for astronauts to travel to and from the station as it is a shorter distance from Earth, approximately 250 miles— roughly the distance between Washington, DC, and New York City.\n\nNASA plans to use its upcoming Artemis missions to send astronauts beyond the Van Allen Belts to land on the south pole of the Moon by the end of 2025, and eventually on to Mars.\n\nSince a one-way trip to Mars could take six to nine months, it is important to first develop technologies and conduct research on the Moon to better understand what is needed to thrive in deep space.\n\nSince the Moon is more accessible to us than Mars, scientists can use it to gain important scientific knowledge about the effects of the harsh conditions of deep space on living systems. Altered gravity, high energy radiation exposure, and different atmospheric composition are just a few of the unique stressors that can affect our ability to sustain life off-Earth.\n\nTheArtemis Imission was an important step towards understanding the impacts to life beyond the Van Allen Belts by flying model organisms around the Moon and back. This research could help identify which crops to grow on the Moon, alternative sources of fuel, and how to ensure crew health during long periods of exposure to the harsh conditions of space beyond the protective layers of the Van Allen Belts.\n\nAround the Moon and Back: A Test Drive for ScienceStudying the Van Allen Belts 60 Years After America’s First SpacecraftRadiation Belts – Fun Facts\n\nCitations1https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/rbsp/mission/fun-facts.html\n\nWebb is the premier observatory of the next decade, serving thousands of astronomers worldwide.

One way to do this is by using organisms that possess properties similar to humans, such as fungi.\n\nThe Biological and Physical Sciences (BPS) Division at NASA conducted four investigations, collectively known asBiological Experiment 01 (BioExpt-01), using model organisms aboard theArtemis Imission, an uncrewed test flight sent around the Moon and back. Here’s why fungi was among the four “passengers”…\n\nThere are three main reasons fungi was included. First, researchers can test how fungi is impacted by the high levels of radiation experienced during space exploration. Understanding how radiation affects microorganisms like fungi can allow researchers to find new strategies or medicines to prevent astronauts from radiation harm.\n\nSecond, researchers want to develop new biomaterials to make a protective coating for spacecrafts and the electronic equipment used in space. Understanding how fungi responds to radiation will aid in the development of this protective layer.\n\nThird, researchers want to learn how fungi can be used in space biomanufacturing. Fungi could help eventually produce biomaterials, medicine, and even food used to sustain life on other planets. The ability to “make, not take” certain supplies eliminates the need to transport them from Earth, saving costs.\n\nFungi have a natural ability to survive and grow in extreme conditions. Fungi are one of the first organisms to thrive in environments on Earth that experience nuclear activity and, therefore, high levels of radiation.\n\nResearchers are particularly interested in observing the importance of fungi’s natural protective qualities, such as DNA repair and melanin synthesis. How DNA repairs itself after damage caused by radiation can affect the adaption and survival of an organism. Melanin, a pigment occurring in the hair, skin, and iris of the eye that helps block damaging ultraviolet rays, could also be key to surviving in harsh environments outside of Earth.\n\nThese findings about the impact of radiation and the effectiveness of fungi’s natural protective qualities can be applied to humans, helping to protect astronauts as they explore and establish a sustainable presence in space —during future Artemis II and Artemis III missions.\n\nWebb is the premier observatory of the next decade, serving thousands of astronomers worldwide.

A study published in npj Microgravity shows how analyzing diverse datasets together can reveal insights that might otherwise be missed — in this case, linking space-grown food quality to astronaut nutrition and gut health.\n\nThepaperreviewed previous studies of plants grown aboard the International Space Station. The authors found that some edible plants grown in low Earth orbit have lower concentrations of essential nutrients, like calcium and magnesium, than those grown on Earth.\n\nThe reduced levels of these nutrients could make crops not as effective in mitigating the bone loss and reduced immune function that astronauts encounter in space.\n\nThree Analysis Working Groups from NASA'sOpen Science Data Repositorycollaborated to make this paper possible. These discipline-specific groups typically work independently, but this project sparked conversations among researchers with different specialties.\n\nResearchers combined plant data, crop nutrition profiles, gut studies, and astronaut blood biomarkers — a data integration effort of the Biological and Physical Sciences Divisionopen sciencemodel. The work also draws on data from JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency).\n\nFor NASA, these findings offer new insights into how to feed and support astronauts in space, particularly on long-duration missions to the Moon and Mars.\n\nThe study also examined increased intestinal permeability — often called “leaky gut” — a condition that can result from poor nutrition and may be exacerbated by the space environment. Intestinal permeability may interfere with how astronauts absorb nutrients and regulate immune responses.\n\nIf properly engineered, space-grown crops could offer a solution to these health challenges. The team outlined several potential strategies, including bioengineering plants with higher nutrient content, incorporating more antioxidant-rich species, and designing personalized nutrition plans using astronauts' genetic information.\n\nThe study suggests targeting specific biological pathways, such as using compounds like quercetin, an antioxidant found in certain crops, to address bone health challenges at the molecular level.

The findings of his research with Dr. Dorothy Shippen offer insight into the effects of spaceflight on plant chromosomes and how these findings could impact human health.\n\nBarbero:The best analogy is a shoelace. At the very tip of a shoelace is a piece of plastic called an aglet. The aglet holds the shoelace together. If it is damaged or removed, the shoelace begins to unravel. Telomeres are compound structures at the very tip of a chromosome. They protect the ends of chromosomes from becoming frayed or tangled. Therefore, telomeres are vital for chromosome survival.\n\nBarbero:They are probably the best-known markers of cell survival. It is a longevity marker. The length of a telomere is a very important indicator of the health of an organism. In humans, if telomeres are too long, it could be a marker of malignancies like cancer. If telomeres are too short, it could be a sign of premature aging. As humans get older, their telomeres become shorter over time. Plants do not have cancer, but a shorter telomere length is a marker for the plant not being able to survive multiple generations.\n\nAging, genetics, and environmental factors cause telomere shortening. The ideal length for a telomere is species specific. A healthy telomere length for humans is between 5-15 kilobases (a unit of measure used to designate the length of DNA or RNA). InArabidopsis thaliana(Col-0 ecotype), a model plant related to mustard plants, a healthy telomere range is between 2-5 kilobases.\n\nBarbero:The idea was sparked by theNASA Twins Study. Identical twin brothers, Mark and Scott Kelly, both NASA astronauts, participated in an experiment that helped scientists better understand the impacts of spaceflight on the human body. This was accomplished by comparing Scott Kelly, who spent one year on the International Space Station, to his brother, Mark Kelly, who remained on Earth.\n\nOne of the key findings of the study was the change in telomere length. Scott Kelly’s telomeres grew longer while he was in space. When he returned to Earth, some of his telomeres fell below baseline. As mentioned previously, telomere lengthening can be a hallmark for malignancies. Short telomeres are associated with stem cell disease. So, that led us to question, is this something that happens in other organisms? What happens to plant telomeres in microgravity?\n\nIf we want to rely on plants as a food source and as a way to generate oxygen and remove carbon dioxide, we need to make sure plants last a long time in space.\n\nBarbero:This experiment was launched in June of 2021 on the SpaceX-22 Commercial Resupply Services mission. We used Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings that were kept in a petri dish. They grew inside the Vegetable Production System (Veggie) hardware on the International Space Station for 12 days. The samples were then frozen and sent back down to Earth. The plants were then carefully dissected and analyzed in a lab.\n\nBarbero:To our surprise, the plants that were kept on the International Space Station had no change in telomere length. The length of the telomeres in space were the same as the plants on Earth. This leads us to believe that plants may be more than capable of maintaining their genome in harsh environments, which means, plants can be kept through many generations in low Earth orbit.\n\nBarbero:We have a pretty good idea of the mechanism of telomere maintenance in plants. There’s a potential avenue to understand how this mechanism can possibly benefit human telomeres. We can investigate how the plant telomere maintenance mechanism differs from human telomere maintenance mechanisms. This could help us understand why human telomeres got longer in space. It’s a very tough question to answer, but that’s why we need to keep pushing towards the same goal in science.\n\nBarbero:Now, we are trying to understand how radiation affects plant telomeres. We will investigate howArabidopsis thalianatelomeres respond to a wide range of stressors in a state-of-the-art galactic cosmic ray simulator. In the Artemis era, where humans are going to be exposed to a greater amount of radiation, we also need to study how plant telomeres are maintained with an increasing source of radiation. Could plants be a reliable food source beyond low Earth orbit?", "ocr_text": "", "media_assets":

After the oxygen tank explosion and subsequent damage to the spacecraft, the agency used simulators and vehicle modeling not only to evaluate the cause of the anomaly but also to develop and test real-time solutions for the astronauts' survival.\n\nDecades after Apollo 13, John Vickers, principal technologist and associate director of the Materials and Processes Laboratory at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center, was credited with coining the term “digital twins,” in 2010.\n\nInstruments and spacecraft systems continue to grow in complexity. The digital twin’s goal is not only to ensure these technologies operate as expected and for longer durations but also to enablereal-time monitoring, predictive maintenance and adaptive decision-making – such capabilities are critical as we prepare to return to the Moon.It can play a critical role in forecasting the probabilities of mission success.\n\nSeveral digital twins helped successfully test and monitor the James Webb Space Telescope. The world’s most advanced space telescope, which stands four stories high and the length of a tennis court, could not fit in NASA’s thermal vacuum chamber, prompting the Agency to build a digital twin.\n\nOne digital twin modeled the telescope “core” to test its core temperature since a spike in temperature could make the telescope “blind” and unable to look for the universe’s most distant galaxies. Next, a 3D video-based digital twin was developed to enable NASA scientists and partners to follow in real time the unfurling of the giant telescope’smassive sunshield, a complicated maneuver that had 344 different ways to fail.\n\nThese virtual models are alsotransforming analytics on Earth, providing an integrated picture of Earth systems, past and present, as well as how they will evolve in the future.Using a replica of Earth, NASA can detect and monitor floods, the planet’s oceans for carbon, wildfires and air quality, to name a few examples. NASA’s Wildfire Digital Twin uses AI and machine learning to forecast potential burn paths, merging data from sensors to produce precise global models.\n\nDigital twins hold great promise torevolutionize personalized medicine, from preventing to treating diseases. On Earth, digital twins are already used to suggest real-time adjustments to insulin delivery for patients with Type 1 diabetes and show great potential in diagnosing and treating cardiac conditions.\n\nIn space,astronaut digital twins could play a pivotal role in predicting and mitigating health issues during missions.By integrating genomic profiles, age, gender, previous flight data and medical history, these tools could enable real-time health monitoring and personalized interventions, paving the way for safer deep space exploration.\n\nDigital twins could provide the path forward for humanity to realize its deep-space ambitions. From modeling and simulation to real-time monitoring, digital twins show promise to enhance the safety and reliability of space missions in the era of AI and autonomous operations.\n\nDigital twins are transforming life on Earth, making it easier to anticipate and tackle complex problems. We now enjoy a better picture of Earth, including predicting natural disasters. The technology shows great promise in improving how we diagnose, treat and monitor conditions like heart disease and diabetes, so people live longer, healthier lives.\n\nRelated resources:\n\nDigital Twin Summit NASA PowerPoint Presentation\n\nAbout BPS:\n\nNASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences Division pioneers scientific discovery and enables exploration by using space environments to conduct investigations not possible on Earth.

This research could help protect astronauts on future long-duration missions to the Moon and Mars, while also advancing treatments for millions of people on Earth who suffer from osteoporosis.\n\nDuring long-duration missions, astronauts may experience a gradual reduction in bone density—typically around 1% to 2% per month—even with consistent exercise routines. While scientists understand how bones work on Earth, they aren’t sure exactly why bones weaken so quickly in microgravity.\n\nPrevious research aboard the space station revealed that microgravity changes how stem cells behave and what substances they release. Scientists now want to dig deeper into these cellular changes to better understand what causes bone loss in space and explore potential ways to prevent it.\n\nThe Microgravity Associated Bone Loss-B (MABL-B) investigation focuses on special stem cells called mesenchymal stem cells, or MSCs. As these cells mature, they build new bone tissue in the body.\n\nScientists suspect that a protein called IL-6 might be the culprit behind bone problems in space. Data from the earlierMABL-A missionsuggests that microgravity promotes the type of IL-6 signaling that enhances bone degradation. The MABL-B experiment will investigate this by testing ways to block this IL-6 signaling pathway.\n\nThe experiment will grow mesenchymal stem cells alongside other bone cells in special containers designed for space research. Cells will be cultured for 19 days aboard the space station, with crew members periodically collecting samples for analysis back on Earth.\n\nThe research could lead to targeted treatments that protect astronauts from bone loss during long-duration missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond. As crews venture farther from Earth, bone health becomes increasingly critical since medical evacuation or emergency return to Earth won't be possible during Mars missions.\n\nThe findings could provide new insights into age-related bone loss that affects millions of people on Earth. Understanding how the IL-6 protein affects bone health may lead to new treatments for osteoporosis and other bone conditions that come with aging.\n\nNASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences Divisionpioneers scientific discovery and enables exploration by using space environments to conduct investigations not possible on Earth. Studying biological and physical phenomenon under extreme conditions allows researchers to advance the fundamental scientific knowledge required to go farther and stay longer in space, while also benefitting life on Earth.", "ocr_text": "", "media_assets": ["https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/missions/hubble/galaxies/spiral/Hubble_NGC2775_potw2538a.jpg?w=1024",

For example, when water freezes, it becomes ice, which is a molecular crystal. Some crystals are a mixture of different kinds of materials.\n\nThe world would be a very different place if it wasn’t for crystals. We come in contact with crystals every day—from your coffee cup to your cell phone. Almost all metals, ceramics, and semiconductors are crystals. Silicon is a crystal used to form the “brains” of electronic and computing devices such as microprocessors or memory chips. All computers and cell phones have semiconductor crystals inside of them. Other types of semiconductor crystals can be used as detectors for different optic wavelengths, such as infrared, x-ray, and gamma ray.\n\nTurbine blades, made from metal crystals, are used in the engines of jets.\n\nLasers, such as the ones used in scanners at the grocery store, are made from optical crystals, which are a type of semiconductor crystal. TheGrowth of Ternary Compound Semiconductors (GTCS) experimentcompares zinc selenide crystals grown in space against the ones grown on Earth. Results could improve high-powered lasers operating in infrared wavelengths by providing insights on how gravity affects the electrical, structural, and optical characteristics of crystals.\n\nScientists have been trying to optimize crystallization processes for many years. They study different kinds of crystal growth parameters to optimize the specific kind of crystal they want to grow. Optimizing crystal growth can lead to improvements in various fields such asmedicineand technology.\n\nCrystals grown on Earth tend to have defects. Little cracks in the crystals can be detrimental to the properties that scientists want to achieve with the crystal. That’s why NASA grows crystals on the International Space Station—in a microgravity environment, where many classes of crystals grow better. Gravity gives rise to convection, which can have negative effects on the quality of the crystal. In a microgravity environment, there’s significantly less convection, which results in crystals of much higher purity. The ISS is used as a laboratory to understand the crystallization process. By learning these processes, they can be applied on Earth.\n\nCrystallization 101: Why NASA studies crystals in space:https://youtu.be/XR1hqp9GR0Q\n\nSpace crystals contribute to advancements in

The milestone prompts the question, “Why should we study the world we don’t see?”\n\nWe live in a quantum world — in the realm of the very small. Comprised of atomic and subatomic particles, or the building blocks of all matter, quantum research helps us better understand the connected nature of a universe, but even with quantum mechanics,scientists can only explain less than 5% of the mass and energy in the known universe.\n\nAs a branch of physics,quantum mechanics explains what classical physics cannot: how particles behave like waves at the atomic level. Quantum research makes it possible to explain the behavior and interactions between these particles, as well as the forces that hold atoms together and give structure to our universe. It underlies everyday devices such as cellphones, computers, medical devices, and GPS, not to mention lasers, fiber optics, and LEDs.\n\nNASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences (BPS) Division uses the unique conditions of space to dive deeper into the behavior of these atomsand, at the same time, to uncover whether Albert Einstein was right about how the universe behaves. In Einstein’s theory, time does not pass at the same rate for everyone. Space and time are warped by matter.\n\nValidating Einstein’s theory of general relativity deepens our understanding of gravity and can provide insightsinto the nature ofdark matteranddark energy, which comprise 95% of the mass and energy of the cosmos. Furthermore, we can only detect these phenomena on cosmological scales; that is, through their effects on the scale of galaxies and throughout the universe, not locally from our vantage point on Earth.\n\nAstronomers call dark matter the galaxy’s “scaffolding” — we can’t see it, but we can feel its gravitational pull. Dark energy, meanwhile, is like a balloon inflating in space — a mysterious influence driving the accelerated expansion of the universe.\n\nLaunched to the space station in May 2018, serves as a first-of-its-kind facility to study ultra-cold atoms in microgravity. The approximate size of a small refrigerator, the Cold Atom Lab often is labeled the “coolest place in the known universe,” because of its ability to chill atoms to almost absolute zero. These almost motionless atoms, called Bose-Einstein Condensates, get so cold they begin acting like a single, large particle, allowing scientists to observe quantum effects.While scientists demonstrated the first Bose-Einstein Condensate in 1995, the microgravity environment of space bypasses terrestrial limitations, enabling studies of quantum matter that cannot be conducted on Earth. The experiments NASA is performing using the Cold Atom Lab will someday allow scientists to measure gravity with unprecedented precision.Precise measurements of gravity could underly future technologies that improve spacecraft navigation, track water on Earth, explore the composition of moons and other planets from orbit, and probe mysterious cosmic phenomena, like dark matter and dark energy.\n\nExplore\n\nSEAQUE was deployed in November 2024 on the Materials International Space Station Experiment. This experiment aims to demonstrate quantum-level communication in space through entanglement, a fundamental principle in quantum physics where particles remain connected even when separated by great distance. SEAQUE is testing technologies that could enable secure, long-distance quantum communication using entangled photons, potentially paving the way for quantum networks in space and on Earth.This advancement ultimately could result in enhanced security for data transmission between spacecrafts and improved capabilities for quantum computing and sensing applications on Earth.\n\nExplore\n\nACES,a European Space Agency investigation for which BPS is providing ground support and atomic clocks on the ground for comparison, isexpected to launch to the International Space Station in 2025. This experiment will demonstrate a new generation of atomic clocks in the space environment to test Einstein’s theory of general relativity by measuring time with extreme accuracy in space.The ACES network will allow scientists to compare ground clocks at high resolution on a world-wide basis using both microwave and optical links.\n\nExplore\n\nAlthough 100 years have passed since the development of quantum mechanics, much remains unknown about quantum phenomena. Using space as a laboratory, however, has led to scientific breakthroughs that could unlock mysteries of the universe and contribute to new technologies beyond our imagination.\n\nHow this benefits space exploration:\n\nInsights from quantum research could advance humanity’s exploration of space by enabling highly precise measurements of phenomena in space, improving navigation, and enhancing space situational awareness.\n\nHow this benefits humanity:\n\nQuantum research has contributed to technologies used in everyday life, including GPS navigation, medical imaging, cell phones, computers, and more. NASA’s quantum research also advances scientific knowledge, opening up new career pathways and inspiring new generations of physicists.\n\nLearn more about unraveling ​mysteries of the universe​.\n\nNASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences Divisionpioneers scientific discovery and enables exploration by using space environments to conduct investigations not possible on Earth. Studying biological and physical phenomenon under extreme conditions allows researchers to advance the fundamental scientific knowledge required to go farther and stay longer in space, while also benefitting life on Earth.\n\nStay up-to-date with the latest content from NASA as we explore the universe and discover more about our home planet.\n\nOn May 1st and 2nd, the Open Science Data Repository (OSDR) hosted the 2024 AWG Symposium, a virtual event that…\n\nOn Thursday, March 16th, Open Science hosted the 2023 Analysis Working Group (AWG) Symposium from 10 am – 2:30 pm…\n\nOn Thursday, June 30th, GeneLab hosted the 2022 AWG Symposium from 10 am – 2:30 pm PT.

These cells are converted to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that can become nearly any type of cell in the human body.\n\nResearchers culture iPSCs in an organ-chip — an engineered environment similar to the human body — to create miniature avatars of the human organ they’re interested in studying.\n\nSinceorgan-chipsare made directly from human cells, they are considered more accurate models for comparing scientific and biomedical data.They can be used to understand how and why the human body adapts to changes in the spaceflight environment and other extreme conditions.\n\nSending organ-chips beyond the protective shield of Earth’sVan Allen Beltsenables researchers to study the effects of extreme stressors, particularly radiation, on human cells without putting humans at risk.\n\nOrgan-chips are being used by NASA and other researchers today — and couldcontribute to big leaps in precision health care, including a deeper understanding of human biology and disease, preventative measures for disease, and personalized therapeutic treatments.\n\nFor example, on Earth, cancer, which has both environmental and genetic components, affects lives around the world and is among the leading causes of death. Researchers are using organ-chips as an essential scientific tool to significantly advance the discovery of how cancer cells originate, grow, and spread.\n\nResearchers and oncologists useorgan-chips today to test new pharmaceutical treatments and understand how a specific patient’s cancer reacts to different treatments.Findings and data from these studies could enable clinicians to tailor cancer treatments to individual patients and decrease the time for screening. These advancements could also reduce secondary effects of the treatments and increase quality of life.\n\nFor NASA,this research could be used to safeguard astronaut health on deep-space missions.The chips can provide insights on how deep-space stressors, including extreme radiation and microgravity, might affect astronauts on an individual level.\n\nAs we go farther and stay longer in space, crew will have limited access to on-site clinical healthcare. Therefore, it’ll be critical to understand if there are unique and specific healthcare needs of each astronaut so that we can test potential countermeasures and send the right supplies with them on missions. NASA could also potentially use this information to personalize medical kits to each crew member during long-duration missions, including the Moon, Mars, and beyond.\n\nNASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences Divisionpioneers scientific discovery and enables exploration by using space environments to conduct investigations not possible on Earth. Studying biological and physical phenomenon under extreme conditions allows researchers to advance the fundamental scientific knowledge required to go farther and stay longer in space, while also benefitting life on Earth.\n\nTissue chipsare small devices containing living cells that mimic complex functions of specific human tissues and organs.\n\nExtending the longevity of tissue chips used for biomedical research could contribute to unprecedented advancements in predictive medicine and personalized healthcare.\n\nSmall devices about the size of a USB drive, 3D tissue chips replicate cells of specific organs – heart, pancreas, liver, and others. These allow researchers to test and observe how cells respond to various environmental factors, such as radiation and microgravity, and treatments, including medications and chemotherapy.",

This surface layer on the Moon is fragmented, sharp rock material.\n\nJust like the Earth has soil, the Moon has lunar regolith. But an important difference is that soil is made of organic materials, whereas regolith is the result of the impact of meteoroidsas well as charged particles from the Sun and stars.\n\nWhile the Earth’s soil is exposed to wind and water, which wear down the edges of the particles, the rock material of lunar regolith remains very sharp with fresh fractured surfaces. This makes theregolith potentially dangerous; it can quickly wear down space suits and equipment and be hazardous to astronaut health.\n\nUnderstanding the possible impacts of lunar regolith is critical to enabling humans to explore and stay on the Moon for longer periods of time.As we stay longer on the Moon and eventually go to Mars, we will need to reduce the quantity of supplies launched from Earth and instead produce supplies using the natural resources available.\n\nRegolith is a natural resource of the Moon. Since it is readily available, it could be a convenient resource for producing supplies, building structures, extracting water and gasses, and growing plants to reduce the need to fly the supplies and raw materials from Earth.\n\nIn fact, scientists have already started experimenting withgrowing plants in lunar regolith.After two days, seeds germinated, although the resulting plants did not grow as well as those grown in more nutrient-rich Earth soil. This research advances scientific knowledge in four areas:\n\nAnother potential use for lunar regolith is in building materials. Scientists are working to understand if regolith can be mixed with cement and different binders to make a type of lunar concrete which could be used to build space habitats and other structures. The goal of theMICS (Microgravity Investigation of Cement Solidification) experimentwas to investigate the complex process of cement solidification in microgravity on the International Space Station. The data from this study and other space station concrete solidification studies can inform research investigations to be conducted in the partial gravity of the Moon.\n\nThe investigation of the potential of regolith on the Moon and Mars for manufacturing and life-sustaining applications is vital for a sustained presence.What scientists find today could propel the future of space agriculture, building, and manufacturing in space.\n\nExperiments have taken place aboard the International Space Station to study cement based concrete in microgravity.\n\nNASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences

NASA's Cold Atom Lab, designed and built at the agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, creates temperatures one ten billionth of a degree above absolute zero — colder than any naturally occurring spot in the universe.\n\nThe Biological and Physical Sciences (BPS) division of NASA funds and manages this specialized facility on the International Space Station. Scientists with the Cold Atom Lab have pushed the boundaries of fundamental physics, developing valuable quantum expertise that has enabled them to provide strategic insights that inform other NASA missions.\n\nThe Cold Atom Lab creates Bose-Einstein condensates — clouds of atoms cooled to the coldest temperature matter can reach. In microgravity, Bose-Einstein condensates can reach colder temperatures more easily and exist for longer than those created in Earth-based laboratories, giving researchers more opportunities to study them. And scientists don't need to leave Earth to run these ultra-cold experiments on the space station; they control everything from their desks.\n\nThe Cold Atom Lab is also the first space-based facility to use Bose-Einstein condensates in atom interferometry, a technique that uses the wave-like nature of atoms to measure properties of the environment with extraordinary precision. Atom interferometers split atom waves and then recombine them.\n\nImagine dropping two pebbles in a pond and watching how the ripples interact — creating patterns of high waves where they meet and flat spots where they cancel out. Atom interferometers work similarly, but with atoms instead of water. By studying these patterns, scientists can detect tiny changes in gravity that affect how the waves interact.\n\nIn the microgravity environment of space, the atoms experience longer freefall times, which makes subsequent measurements of their interactions more precise. Scientists with the Cold Atom Lab are working toward using space-based atom interferometry to measure gravity in space. Future missions could use this technique to track the movement of water on Earth, study the composition of other planets and moons from orbit, and improve spacecraft navigation.\n\nThe Cold Atom Lab team's expertise has helped pave the way forthe start of the Earth Science Technology Office’s Quantum Gravity Gradiometer (QGG) pathfinderproject.\n\nThe QGG is a technology demonstration instrument, sponsored by NASA’s Earth Science Technology Office (ESTO) that will use advanced atom interferometry to test technologies needed to measure Earth's gravitational fields from space with unprecedented accuracy. Like a quantum stethoscope, the QGG instrument will be able to detect the gravitational \"heartbeat\" of matter moving beneath Earth's surface by measuring tiny changes in the pull of gravity.\n\nQuantum-sensing capabilities like those in QGG could help scientists:\n\nThe quantum expertise developed through the Cold Atom Lab provides a strong technical foundation for QGG and future missions. NASA continues to build on this research to expand our understanding of Earth and space.\n\nNASA’s fundamental quantum research catalyzesinnovation and benefits multiple scientific areas.\n\nThe Cold Atom Lab has helped position NASA as a world leader in space-based quantum research. The U.S. is currently the only nation with a continuously operating quantum physics facility in space. The expertise developed for the Cold Atom Lab has created a unique team of quantum specialists who can now support a variety of NASA's scientific and exploration goals.\n\nThe project has also strengthened U.S. commercial and academic capabilities in quantum technologies. Work on the Cold Atom Lab has advanced quantum technology development in both industry and academia.

These states take on forms that are easily observable, whether it’s a coffee mug, the coffee inside it, or the steam rising from it. And you may also know the fourth state of matter: plasma, which is found in sources like lightning, neon bulbs, and stars, including the Sun.\n\nIn 1995, researchers made the ground-breaking discovery that there is a fifth state of matter: Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs). Essentially, BECs are formed when particles are cooled to near absolute zero, causing them to coalesce into a single quantum object that acts as a wave in a relatively large packet.\n\nAlthough difficult to even create on Earth, BECs are now formed in space to enable scientists to study the nature of matter at the smallest (quantum) scale and make important technological advancements.  BECs enable scientists to manipulate a quantum system on a macroscopic scale, enabling a variety of experiments not possible on the microscopic scale.\n\nBy studying how identical BECs behave together as a wave — rendering them visible to ultra-sensitive cameras — scientists are able to gain valuable information about single atoms and subatomic particles where the wave-nature isn’t directly observable.\n\nBEC research can lead to more precise sensors, fundamental insights into nature and our universe, and offers the potential for developing and studying new materials, among many other uses.\n\nIn fact, quantum research has contributed to technologies that touch our everyday lives — things like lasers, cell phones, computers, GPS navigation systems, and MRI scanners for medical imaging. Over a century ago, when scientists first theorized the fifth state of matter, these inventions were the fodder of science fiction. Similarly, continuing to push the boundaries of quantum discovery could contribute to future advancements beyond our wildest imaginations.\n\nA (brief) history of the fifth state of matter\n\nBose-Einstein Condensates are named after physicists Satyendra Nath Bose and Albert Einstein, who predicted the condensates in the 1920s.\n\nIn 1995, physicists Eric Cornell at the National Institute of Standards & Technology and Carl Wieman at the University of Colorado at Boulder created the first BEC in a gas of rubidium atoms, and shortly thereafter, Wolfgang Ketterle at MIT produced a BEC in a gas of sodium atoms. Collectively, this is considered the official discovery of the fifth state of matter.\n\nQuantum and the Cold Atom Lab\n\nToday, scientists with NASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences Division (BPS) conductquantum scienceout of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. These researchers use the space environment to explore the strange world of quantum mechanics in ways not possible on Earth and, since 2018, have been producing BECs almost daily in space using theCold Atom Laboratory(CAL) aboard the International Space Station.\n\nIn CAL, atoms are cooled to within a fraction of a degree above absolute zero. These cold atoms move slowly and are therefore easier to study than here on Earth. Also, in the microgravity environment of space, BECs can float, which extends our observation time of them.\n\nQuantum research enables us to learn more about the fundamental nature of matter, which can provide a greater understanding of how the universe works at the smallest scale. This knowledge could provide a new foundation for future generations of scientists and engineers to innovate from, advance space exploration, and benefit life on Earth.\n\nRelated Information:\n\nHouston We Have a Podcast: The Coolest Experiment in the Universe\n\nNASA's Cold Atom Lab Takes One Giant Leap for Quantum Science\n\nWorld Quantum Day", "ocr_text": "", "media_assets": ["https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/missions/hubble/galaxies/spiral/Hubble_NGC2775_potw2538a.jpg?w=1024", "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/fifth-state-of-matter.jpg", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/esd/eo/content-feature/aerosols/images/aerosol_fine_fraction_depth_201008_hammer.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/acd25-132-006.jpg?w=1024", "https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/ARC-1969-A-16712/ARC-1969-A-16712~large.jpg?w=1920&h=1382&fit=clip&crop=faces%2Cfocalpoint", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/uc-s03-working-file-horizontal-v02-2.png?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/1-pia26662-dsc4667-enhanced-nr.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/taking-in-the-view-surface-from-hls.png?w=1024", "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/themes/nasa-child/assets/images/nasa-logo@2x.png", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/cds/general/images/2023/03/53636962950-44cdcf9882-o.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/jsc2023e006587.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/cds/learn/science-activation-stories/2025/2025-0805-RiversofStarsandStories-30-moonactivity-sm-Brandi_Stewart.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/psd/solar-system/skywatching/2025/october/02_Jupiter%20and%20Saturn_Credit_Preston%20Dyches_CC%20BY-NC%202.0.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/iss070e001252.jpg?w=1024", "https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/AFRC2025-0013-02/AFRC2025-0013-02~large.jpg?w=1919&h=1536&fit=clip&crop=faces%2Cfocalpoint", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/astro/exo-explore/exoplanet-artists-concepts/WISPIT%202%20b%20Wide%20Final.png?w=1024", "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/fifth-state-of-matter.jpg?w=2048", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/cds/general/images/2023/09/exoplanetwatch-896.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/img-3738.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/missions/webb/science/2025/09/STScI-01K6196E18EPYF8RDEAQVA01Y3.png?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/missions/prism/prism-data-cube.png?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/psd/photojournal/pia/pia13/pia13126/PIA13126.tif?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/astro/programs/exep/images/exo.png?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/esd/articles/2025/hydroflame_banner.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/afrc2025-0030-83.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/esd/articles/2025/A90%20NASA%20Chesapeake%20Shawn%20Serbin.jpeg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/content/dam/science/astro/programs/physics-of-the-cosmos/images/gwsig/gravitational_waves-16.gif", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/gsfc-20171208-archive-e000760orig-stpatricksaurora-iotd.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/20240131-207a0543.png?w=1024"], "referenced_urls": [], "provenance": {"parser_path": "external.explainers", "fetched_at": "2025-10-04T03:36:24.467838", "source_type": "html"}}, "grounded_entities": [{"text": "microgravity", "entity_type": "exposure", "id": "CUSTOM:EXPOSURE:MICROGRAVITY", "label": "microgravity", "source_obo": "CUSTOM", "confidence": 1.0, "spans": [[3191, 3203]]}, {"text": "International Space Station", "entity_type": "platform", "id": "CUSTOM:PLATFORM:ISS", "label": "ISS", "source_obo": "CUSTOM", "confidence": 1.0, "spans": [[2986, 3013]]}, {"text": "MRI", "entity_type": "assay", "id": "CUSTOM:ASSAY:IMAGING", "label": "imaging", "source_obo": "CUSTOM", "confidence": 1.0, "spans": [[1694, 1697]]}, {"text": "Day", "entity_type": "duration", "id": "CUSTOM:DURATION:ACUTE", "label": "acute", "source_obo": "CUSTOM", "confidence": 1.0, "spans": [[3796, 3799]]}], "referenced_ids": {"pmcid": [], "doi": [], "osdr_id": [], "taskbook_id": []}}

It could also serve as a source of food and be used to produce biologics, such as medicines, in space.  That’s why researchers sought to identify which strains of algae would not just survive, but thrive, in the harsh conditions of deep space.\n\nFor the experiment, researchers inserted a tardigrade gene into algal cells using short pulses of electricity. Tardigrades are known as water bears because they resemble miniature bears under a microscope, The gene calledDsup(short for Damage suppressor)allows tardigrades to withstand environmental conditions on Earth that are harmful to other forms of life. This enabled the researchers to test whether the gene that helps tardigrades survive harsh environments on Earth can protect algal cells as well.\n\nResults from “Fuel to Mars” suggest that the green alga used in Artemis I, might make the best traveling companion on future missions. Samples from the study revealed a “population survival response,” where the space environment, including the galactic cosmic radiation field, potentially stimulated, rather than impeded, algae survival.\n\nAnother observation from the research is thatChlamydomonas,even without the tardigrade gene, may have their own strategy to survive harmful conditions of the space environment. The researchers found that someChlamydomonascells on the Artemis I flight produced more carotenoids, a type of pigment that gives vegetables and fruits their brilliant colors.\n\nAntioxidant properties of carotenoids are known to provide protection from stress and could partly explain why some algal cells were better protected than others when exposed to galactic cosmic radiation.\n\nThe Artemis I experiment also included a successful technology demonstration of scientific hardware, known as Moonshot. It provided light cycles to maintain algal cell growth and conducted measurements of the environment throughout the journey around the Moon.\n\nScientists plan to apply these findings for the benefit of both astronauts and citizens. In addition to informing which resources to send on future Moon and Mars missions, this research could also advance radiation therapies for treatments on Earth.\n\nLearn More:\n\nAbout BPS\n\nNASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences Divisionpioneers scientific discovery and enables exploration by using space environments to conduct investigations not possible on Earth. Studying biological and physical phenomenon under extreme conditions allows researchers to advance the fundamental scientific knowledge required to go farther and stay longer in space, while also benefitting life on Earth.", "ocr_text": "", "media_assets": ["https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/missions/hubble/galaxies/spiral/Hubble_NGC2775_potw2538a.jpg?w=1024", "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/cs-04.png?w=1494", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/esd/eo/content-feature/aerosols/images/aerosol_fine_fraction_depth_201008_hammer.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/acd25-132-006.jpg?w=1024", "https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/ARC-1969-A-16712/ARC-1969-A-16712~large.jpg?w=1920&h=1382&fit=clip&crop=faces%2Cfocalpoint", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/uc-s03-working-file-horizontal-v02-2.png?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/1-pia26662-dsc4667-enhanced-nr.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/taking-in-the-view-surface-from-hls.png?w=1024", "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/themes/nasa-child/assets/images/nasa-logo@2x.png", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/cds/general/images/2023/03/53636962950-44cdcf9882-o.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/jsc2023e006587.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/cds/learn/science-activation-stories/2025/2025-0805-RiversofStarsandStories-30-moonactivity-sm-Brandi_Stewart.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/psd/solar-system/skywatching/2025/october/02_Jupiter%20and%20Saturn_Credit_Preston%20Dyches_CC%20BY-NC%202.0.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/iss070e001252.jpg?w=1024", "https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/AFRC2025-0013-02/AFRC2025-0013-02~large.jpg?w=1919&h=1536&fit=clip&crop=faces%2Cfocalpoint", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/astro/exo-explore/exoplanet-artists-concepts/WISPIT%202%20b%20Wide%20Final.png?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/cds/general/images/2023/09/exoplanetwatch-896.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/img-3738.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/missions/webb/science/2025/09/STScI-01K6196E18EPYF8RDEAQVA01Y3.png?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/missions/prism/prism-data-cube.png?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/psd/photojournal/pia/pia13/pia13126/PIA13126.tif?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/astro/programs/exep/images/exo.png?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/esd/articles/2025/hydroflame_banner.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/afrc2025-0030-83.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/esd/articles/2025/A90%20NASA%20Chesapeake%20Shawn%20Serbin.jpeg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/content/dam/science/astro/programs/physics-of-the-cosmos/images/gwsig/gravitational_waves-16.gif", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/gsfc-20171208-archive-e000760orig-stpatricksaurora-iotd.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/20240131-207a0543.png?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/bps/space-crops/chlamydomonas-reinhardtii-colored.jpg?w=480&h=270&fit=clip&crop=faces%2Cfocalpoint", "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/cs-04.png"], "referenced_urls": [], "provenance": {"parser_path": "external.explainers", "fetched_at": "2025-10-04T03:36:24.514056", "source_type": "html"}}, "grounded_entities": [{"text": "radiation", "entity_type": "exposure", "id": "CUSTOM:EXPOSURE:RADIATION", "label": "radiation", "source_obo": "CUSTOM", "confidence": 1.0, "spans": [[312, 321]]}], "referenced_ids": {"pmcid": [], "doi": [], "osdr_id": [], "taskbook_id": []}}

These experiments, many of which are sponsored by NASA’sBiological and Physical Sciences (BPS) Division, are improving our understanding of combustion and the safety of future deep space explorers.\n\nWhen you remove Earth’s gravitational pull, flames behave much differently. The typical shape of a candle flame is caused by less dense warm air rising to be replaced by cooler ambient air from below. In microgravity, however, that circulation effect does not happen, creating a spherical flame!\n\nGravity is a strong force that can cloud scientific studies on Earth. Studying combustion in microgravity provides a unique opportunity for scientists to better understand the fundamental aspects of combustion without that clouding effect of gravity.\n\nAdditionally, researchers study fire in space to better protect astronauts. Astronauts must know what to expect in case of a fire emergency. Unlike on Earth, Astronauts cannot leave the spacecraft and dial 911. The spacecraft environment must be made as safe as possible by using materials that do not burn whenever possible. Some materials may even be more flammable in partial-gravity environments, making this research crucial.\n\nResearchers have designed International Space Station facilities to study combustion while keeping crew safe during the tests. The primary facility used to study flames aboard station is the Combustion Integrated Rack (CIR). CIR safely contains small-scale flame studies and requires little crew interaction.\n\nThe BPS-sponsored Solid Fuel Ignition and Extinction (SoFIE) experiment is designed to slot into the CIR and enables studies of ignition and the flammability of solid spacecraft materials.\n\nLarger scale flame studies have been conducted aboard Northrop Grumman Cygnus spacecraft after they depart station. ThisSaffireseries of experiments allowed for scaled-up studies of fire spread.\n\nAfter decades of space combustion research, researchers have made great progress so far.\n\nWith humanity heading back to the Moon as a part of the Artemis program, studying flames in true lunar gravity is important for crew safety. Tests will help us understand how to better design our habitats, and which materials to avoid which may be more flammable in an environment with less gravity.\n\nThe Flammability of Materials on the Moon (FM2) study will be the first flammability test on another world. The experiment will be conducted on the lunar surface to evaluate flame size, strength, intensity and spread compared to Earth gravity.\n\nRelated Resources\n\nAbout BPS\n\nNASA’s Biological and

You’re lucky if you find them, but you can’t make it happen on command.\n\nThese strange materials break all the rules of how crystals are supposed to work, and discovering them has largely been a matter of chance.\n\nNow, NASA-funded researchers have figured out how to grow these mysterious structures. Scientists can deliberately grow quasicrystals and watch every step of the process happen in real time under a microscope.\n\nImagine building with toy blocks, but instead of using regular bricks that create simple, repeating grids, you're working with special pieces that form incredibly organized patterns that never perfectly repeat. That's essentially what quasicrystals are — materials where atoms arrange themselves in highly ordered but non-repeating patterns.\n\nTraditional crystals look identical when rotated at certain angles, and they can only have particular “symmetries” like 2-fold, 4-fold or 6-fold (like how a square looks the same 4 times as you spin it around). Quasicrystals can have 5-fold, 8-fold, 10-fold, or even 12-fold symmetries that scientists once thought were impossible.\n\nThis strange structure is what makes quasicrystals promising for advanced applications.\n\nProfessor David Marr and his team at Colorado School of Mines cracked a decades-long puzzle. Using funding from a NASA grant, they developed a method to grow dodecagonal quasicrystals — structures with 12-fold symmetry — by manipulating tiny particles with magnetic and electric fields. For the first time, they could watch the entire quasicrystal assembly process happen live under an optical microscope.\n\nThe breakthrough came through their work on the Advanced Colloids Experiment with Temperature Control (ACE-T9). With this development, researchers on Earth could essentially turn a dial to control how fast intricate quasicrystal patterns formed. Instead of relying on luck or chance discoveries, they now have a systematic way to guide particles into these complex, non-repeating arrangements. This could offer a new blueprint for creating advanced materials with quasicrystals.\n\nWhat makes this breakthrough particularly exciting is the level of control the team achieved. Previous quasicrystal discoveries were largely accidental, but now scientists have a systematic approach to creating and studying these materials. That shift from chance discoveries to deliberate creation could be what brings quasicrystal applications from the laboratory into everyday use.\n\nProfessor Marr’s research earned a featured spot on the cover of the scientific journal Nature Physics.\n\nQuasicrystals could potentially solve some serious engineering challenges. In space, materials that can self-assemble might reduce the need for complex construction projects on satellites or habitats. The unique way quasicrystals interact with light could also lead to revolutionary sensor technologies for space exploration missions.\n\nEarth-based applications are equally promising.

These materials exist between traditional solids and liquids, responding dramatically to forces like gravity and temperature.\n\nIn space, scientists can study soft matter's true behavior without gravity's interference, leading to breakthroughs in manufacturing, medicine, and materials science. This research not only advances space exploration technology, but also improves our lives on Earth.\n\nUnderstanding Soft Matter\n\nSoft matter encompasses a fascinating family of materials: colloidal systems, liquid crystals, foams, gels, emulsions, and granular materials. What makes them special is their unique ability to respond and reorganize when exposed to small forces like temperature changes or gravity. Think of silly putty that flows like a liquid but bounces like a solid: that’s soft matter in action.\n\nUnlike traditional materials like steel or glass, soft matter can seamlessly transition between three distinct phases: liquid-solid, liquid-liquid, and liquid-gas. In the microgravity environment of space, scientists can observe these transitions without Earth's gravity masking subtle but important behaviors.\n\nStudying the novel behaviors of these flexible materials in space is revolutionizing our understanding of fundamental physics and opening new doors in materials science and biotechnology.\n\nFrom Space to Your Daily Life\n\nFrom shaving cream lather to fire-suppressing foams, bubble-laden liquids are a common and important material that we utilize on Earth. But studying the behavior and stability of foams is difficult to do given Earth’s gravitational pull. That’s where NASA comes in.\n\nBy studying these “squishy” materials in space, NASA isn’t just advancing fundamental physics — it’s improving products we use every. So far, studies of colloidal systems — which include substances like blood, paint, and fire retardants — have led to five new commercial patents, extended shelf life for household products, and improved manufacturing processes in space and on Earth.\n\nThe International Space Station'sFoam Optics and Mechanics (FOAM)investigation revealed fascinating insights impossible to obtain on Earth. In microgravity, wet foams maintain their structure instead of draining liquid — a common problem in Earth-based studies. Using advanced light-scattering technology and high-precision imaging, scientists observed foam in its purest form.\n\nThis research extends far beyond academic interest. Understanding how foams and gels behave in different gravitational environments helps create:\n\nFuture Frontiers\n\nThis research extends far beyond immediate applications.

While they may sound similar, they are quite different in what they do. What they do have in common is their ability to help us understand how life functions on Earth and in the Universe.\n\nAstrobiology is the study of the origin, evolution, and distribution of life in the Universe1. The hunt for extraterrestrial life might sound like something out of the science-fiction genre, but scientific logic guides this search.\n\nFor NASA scientists, the search to understand life in the Universe starts on Earth. Understanding how life evolved on Earth and what steps made it possible are key to understanding what life might exist outside of it.\n\nTo guide us in our search for life beyond Earth, scientists are studying how life on Earth exists in extreme environments like the scorching hot desert or the freezing Arctic tundra. In our solar system, environments like these can be found on Mars or the icy moons2around Saturn and Jupiter. Future Astrobiology missions will study if these environments in space harbor life.\n\nIn space, tools like robotic science rovers can help scientists search for some of the biosignatures — or signs of life. During the Mars 2020 mission, the rover Perseverance collected data that could be used to look for signs of ancient microbial life3. The rover also collected a suite of samples that a future Mars Sample Return mission will be able to bring back to Earth for study, with all the sophistication and thoroughness of Earth-based instrumentation.\n\nUnderstanding both how life emerged and evolved on Earth and what the limits are to life as we know it guides NASA in its mission to search for life elsewhere in the Universe. Astrobiology strives to answer the question: “Are we alone?”\n\nFor more information, follow NASA’sAstrobiology Programon Twitter at @NASAAstrobio.\n\nSpace Biology\n\nSpace Biology is the study of howthespaceflight environment — such as ionizing radiation, microgravity, isolation, and altered atmosphere — affects life. Studying how living things respond at a fundamental level to these extreme conditions can inform what’s needed to ensure crew health on deep space missions and contribute to biomedical and agricultural advancements on Earth.\n\nThe main objective of NASA’s Space Biology research is to better understand how spaceflight affects living systems in spacecraft, such as the International Space Station, as well as in deep space, on planetary surfaces, or in ground-based experiments that mimic aspects of spaceflight.\n\nThe experiments NASA conducts on these platforms examine how plants, microbes, and model organisms (such as fruit flies, worms, and rodents) adjust or adapt to living in space. Researchers examine metabolism, growth, stress responses, physiology, and developmental processes.\n\nThey study how organisms repair cellular damage and protect themselves from infection and disease in microgravity conditions while also exposed to space radiation. And they do it across the spectrum of biological organization, from molecules to cells, tissues, organs and systems to whole organisms, communities, and ecosystems.\n\nAnother focus of Space Biology is plant biology. Since space is limited aboard spacecraft, astronauts will need access to sustainable, nutritious sources of food for long-term stays in space.\n\nLimited water supplies, microgravity, and different atmospheric and light conditions can affect plant health. Understanding how plants grow in the harsh conditions of space can help scientists determine which ones are most suitable for becoming “space crops.” Research in this field has already contributed to agricultural advancements on Earth, including hydroponic, aeroponic, and vertical farming.\n\nTo learn more about how NASA’sBiological and Physical Sciences Divisionpioneers scientific discovery, follow us on Twitter at @NASASpaceSci.\n\nSummary\n\nAstrobiology focuses on the origins, evolution, and the limits to life on Earth to understand where and how to search for life in space. Space Biology studies how Earthly life responds to space environmental conditions to further our understanding of how life operates in built environments for space exploration.\n\nNASA’s research in both fields has contributed to scientific knowledge, biomedical and technological innovations, and agricultural advancements that benefit both space exploration and terrestrial life.\n\n1https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/about/2https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/news/icy-moons-and-their-plumes/3https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/missions/2020-mars-rover/", "ocr_text": "", "media_assets":

Muscles develop to push against the force of gravity. Sports rely on balls being pulled back to Earth. Cyclists fight against it to climb mountains.\n\nWhat if we didn’t have to contend with gravity? And what can we learn by studying phenomena unencumbered by it? That’s what NASA researchers aim to find out.\n\nRemoving the effects of gravity can enable researchers to answer important scientific questions and study how humans can safely stay longer in space. For example, the shape of flames on Earth is formed by heated, less dense air rising, which is due to gravity. In space, flamesburn as spheres. To better understand the core principles of combustion on Earth and learn how to keep crews safe on deep space missions, NASA’sBiological and Physical Sciences (BPS) Divisionstudies flames in microgravity. While the International Space Station provides a platform for long-duration microgravity studies, BPS scientists can also simulate short-term microgravity on Earth.\n\nAlthough platforms like the space station have made long-duration microgravity accessible, launching research into orbit still takes a significant investment of time and money. Researchers often only have one shot at success and not much control over the study once it is loaded onto the rocket.\n\nSimulating microgravity on Earth is much lower cost and risk. Researchers can easily perform many versions of an experiment and be more hands on with the work, enabling them to gather data quickly.\n\nWhile simulated microgravity can only last for a short time and does not perfectly replicate the space environment, it is a great testing grounds for studies that might later fly aboard the International Space Station. Experiments can be refined on Earth before committing to launching it to the orbiting laboratory. For example, the BPS-sponsoredRing Sheared Dropinvestigation, which studies amyloids and fibrils associated with diseases such as Alzheimer’s,used parabolic flightsto test its equipment before launching the experiment to station.\n\nImportant tools for simulating microgravity close to Earth include drop towers, parabolic flights, and suborbital flights.\n\nTime in microgravity: ~5 seconds\n\nThese ground-basedTowerssupport the dropping of experiments with low drag from air, due to creating a vacuum in the tower before the drop and enable a few seconds of microgravity.\n\nTheseplane flights— also known as “vomit comets” — follow a steep up and down pattern, creating a microgravity environment at the top of the hills of the flight. This is the same effect as when a rider temporarily feels weightless on a roller coaster and is experiencing reduced gravity.\n\nTime in microgravity: 3-4 minutes\n\nRocketscarrying science experiments follow the same parabola as the airplane, but because they fly much higher, the microgravity time is extended.\n\nNASA employs a variety of microgravity platforms to advance scientific research efficiently and cost-effectively.\n\nThere is, however, no substitute for launching research to space. Space stations allow for “unlimited” access to microgravity, which enables researchers to study phenomena for longer periods of time and gather critical data that could lead to transformational discoveries. Together, these research platforms ensure NASA possesses the information needed to go farther and stay longer in deep space.\n\nWhy Do Science in Microgravity?\n\nParabolic Flights Advance Space Technologies for Gesture Control, Propellant Gauging, and Mars Sample Return Capabilities\n\n5 Hazards of Human Spaceflight\n\nNASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences Divisionpioneers scientific discovery and enables exploration by using space environments to conduct investigations not possible on Earth. Studying biological and physical phenomenon under extreme conditions allows researchers to advance the fundamental scientific knowledge required to go farther and stay longer in space, while also benefitting life on Earth.", "ocr_text": "", "media_assets":

Before traveling to Mars, NASA needs to learn how spaceflight is going to affect the astronauts on this demanding journey – and now they can thanks to miniature avatars.\n\nThese avatars will be able to model diseases and help determine medications that are personalized for the individuals who will embark on the uncharted journey. Astonishingly, this remarkable technology exists today and is not a work of science fiction.\n\nSpace travel is exceptionally challenging – particularly on the human body. In spaceflight, astronauts experience a number of stressors like bone loss, muscle atrophy, immune system changes, and other disorders that can affect their health.\n\nCollectively, these stressors can contribute to health issues in astronauts, and as humanity continues to explore space further and longer than before, these astronauts will not have access to a fully equipped hospital or lab to treat their ailments. Enter the need for disease models, advanced drug development and methods to understand biological changes in deep space prior to the voyage.\n\nThe first 3D tissue chip was introduced in 2010 and, after extensive research over  the past 12 years, has shown promising results. These chips are engineered to be roughly the size of a credit card and can be used to represent various human organs by modeling both structure and function of different parts of the body – such as the lungs, liver, kidneys, intestines, bone, muscle and heart. Combined, they can represent multi-organ human systems.\n\nThese miniature avatars of living organ tissues are engineered using a person’s blood or skin cells converted through induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) science to grow the tissue of interest on microfluidic chips. Researchers use these tissue chips within labs, both on Earth and in space aboard the International Space Station, to gain deeper insights into biological effects from spaceflight exposure, understand disease modeling and to predict the efficacy of potential pharmaceuticals.\n\n“3D tissue chips mimic biological organs by providing multi-layer structures and environments that are representative of what you would find inside of the human body,” says Dr. Lisa Carnell, Program Scientist for Translational Research in NASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences division.\n\n3D tissue chips have already proven their value in current research, so scientists have high hopes for this new technology in the future. Recently, tissue chips were used to study COVID-19 helping to understand the disease pathology and to test potential therapeutics.\n\nNASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences division, the Department of Health and Human Services National Institutes of Health (NIH), Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), and FDA are collaborating on the next steps in advancing 3D tissue chips even further.\n\nCurrently, 3D tissue chips are only viable for about a month limiting their use. This multi-agency collaboration aims to change that by funding nine contracts that will extend tissue viability and physiological function to a minimum of six months. By extending tissue viability, researchers will be able to test acute and chronic exposures to drugs, radiation, environmental hazards, infection, and microgravity, to name a few.\n\n“NASA wants to send these avatars to deep space, the Moon, and Mars, so that we can understand what is happening to human biology in space and come up with ways to protect astronauts,” explains Carnell. “These are going to be really valuable for NASA, to ensure that humans can thrive in deep space on future Artemis missions.”\n\nHere are the teams of researchers working to extend the tissue chip longevity to study a wide variety of biological changes including neurotoxic stressors, radiation exposure, and acute and chronic exposures to drugs to name a few.\n\nElizabeth Blaber, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,Understanding the Brain-Liver-Gut Axis during Spaceflight and Aginginvestigation will provide long-term, multicellular complex human tissue models for studying responses to acute and chronic spaceflight stressors that mimic deep space exploration.\n\nJoel Blanchard, ICAHN School of Medicine at Mount Sinai,Identification of Biomarkers and Pathological Mechanisms via Longitudinal Analysis of Neurological and Cerebrovascular Responses to Neurotoxic Stress Using a Multi-cellular Integrated Model of the Human Braininvestigation will determine how genetically diverse human brain tissue responds to neurotoxic stresses that may be encountered in space.\n\nGuohao Dai, Northeastern University,Bioengineer Long-lasting 3D Neurovascular Microphysiological System to Model Chronic Inflammation-mediated Neurodegenerationinvestigation will develop a long-lasting neurovascular model that can be used to evaluate the impact of chronic stressors to the brain.\n\nDr. Guillermo García-Cardeña, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Inc.Modeling Anthracycline-triggered Vascular Dysfunctioninvestigation will use an organ-on-chip platform to investigate how a chemotherapy drug, doxorubicin, triggers vascular cell dysfunction which will support development of new therapeutic interventions to curtail off-target effects.\n\nAbhishek Jain, Texas A&M,Long-term Patient iPSC Vessel Chip Model to Assess Stressors of Atherosclerosis and mRNA Therapeuticsinvestigation will study vascular signaling mechanisms to identify therapeutics for aging and radiation-related vascular diseases.\n\nChristopher Porada, Wake Forest University,Long-lived Single- and Multi-organ Tissue Equivalent (OTE) Platforms to Model the Response of Human Tissues to Various Stressorsinvestigation will use human organ tissue equivalents (OTEs) to gain insight into how different human tissues respond to spaceflight.\n\nGordana Vunjak-Novakovic, Columbia University,MORPH: Multi-Organ Repair Post Hypoxiainvestigation will study the effects of acute hypoxia on organ systems that are most critically affected: brain, heart, bone marrow and vasculature.\n\nJoseph Wu, Stanford University,Assessing Long-Term Effects of Radiation Exposure in Engineered Heart & Vascular Tissuesinvestigation will gain a better understanding of how and why radiation exposure causes disease by using heart and blood vessel-like tissues created with stem cell biology and tissue engineering technology.\n\nCatherine Yeung, University of Washington,Extended Culture of Kidney MPS and Organoids to Model Acute and Chronic Exposure to Drugs and Environmental Toxinsinvestigation will use kidney chips and organoids to better understand injury and recovery from chronic exposure to drugs, toxins and pathogens.\n\nNASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences Division pioneers scientific discovery and enables exploration by using space environments to conduct investigations not possible on Earth. Studying biological and physical phenomenon under extreme conditions allows researchers to advance the fundamental scientific knowledge required to go farther and stay longer in space, while also benefitting life on Earth.\n\nWebb is the premier observatory of the next decade, serving thousands of astronomers worldwide.

The applications came from graduate students and early career professionals in diverse disciplines, including astronomy, ecology, engineering, nursing, policy, and zoology, to name a few.\n\nSadie Coffin, AAPS-NASA Cit Sci Leaders Fellow. (Credit: Olivia Schlichtkrull)\n\nWe are delighted to announce thatSadie Coffin, PhD student and co-lead (alongside her advisor, Dr. Jeyhan Kartaltepe) of theRedshift Wrangler project, will serve as the AAPS-NASA Cit Sci Leaders Fellow. Sadie’s task is to curate resources, advice, and best practices on topics of common interest from four years of NASA Cit Sci Leaders events. Sadie will dig into our recordings to find the moments, speakers, advice, and resources that offer the best guidance for project leaders starting or managing projects. She’ll help package the best elements of the recordings into usable formats for busy scientists and project leaders interested in creating, managing, and improving participatory science projects.\n\n“This fellowship offers a unique opportunity to gain the mentorship and expertise I need to build a career that not only advances research but also fosters public engagement and inclusivity in science,” said Sadie.\n\nThe enthusiasm, talent, and passion in the applications we received revealed the broad appeal, utility, and growing acceptance of participatory research. One applicant commented, “Working in the participatory sciences is how I find meaning in my career as a researcher.”  Many others commented that they were eager to connect with mentors and colleagues who were as invested in this work as they were.\n\nThank you to everyone who applied for this fellowship and to all of the early career professionals working in this field. You are inspiring, and we can’t wait to see what big ideas you contribute to the growth of this field! AAPS will announce additional fellowships focused on different projects in the coming months. Please watch for upcoming calls, consider applying yourself, and share them with the inspiring early career individuals in your networks!\n\nA NASA-sponsored team at the University of Iowa (UI) is

There are different gravity levels on the Moon and Mars to consider, different levels of radiation, different wavelengths of light – all of which need to be better understood before we can hope to colonize these new worlds.  Dr. John Z. Kiss is one of the biologists selected by NASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences Division, to help provide that understanding.\n\nDr. Kiss was the Co-Principal Investigator (Co-PI) for the Seedling Growth project, a NASA supported series of plant biology experiments onboard the International Space Station. During 3 separate missions, Dr. Kiss studied how plants react to different levels of gravity and light in conditions similar to those we’ll find on the Moon and Mars. But what made these experiments truly unique was the international team behind them. As NASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences Division chose Dr. Kiss to be their Co-PI, the European Space Agency chose Dr. F. Javier Medina as their Co-PI. The two biologists then assembled an international team from the USA, Spain, France, Germany, Norway, and the Netherlands. The result? Their combined work over a four-year period was so influential that the two scientists were recently awarded one of the highest honors in the global science community: The COSPAR Medal.\n\nCOSPAR – the Committee on Space Research – only bestows four medals biannually. Dr. Kiss and Dr. Medina won theCOSPAR International Cooperation Medal– a “humbling” experience according to Dr. Kiss.\n\nDr. Marianne Steele, a NASA contractor with Wyle Labs, served as the Deputy Project Manager and Project Manager for all of Dr. Kiss’ flight studies. She’s not surprised that he won this particular COSPAR Medal: “He is open and free in sharing knowledge. He works together with his peers and his coworkers to go beyond his individual research. He is also passionate about students and passing information on to the next generation. Those are the qualities you need to engage in international cooperation.”\n\nDr. Kiss and his team uncovered a prodigious amount of new knowledge about plant life in Space. As the COSPAR medal nominating committee noted: “[The Seedling Growth] project resulted in outstanding scientific output (24 peer-reviewed publications plus 62 published abstracts) from a spaceflight project with plants and allowed for a fantastic training opportunity for graduate students and post-doctoral researchers. The number of publications in peer reviewed journals and scientific presentations is among the highest for any life sciences spaceflight project to date.”\n\nThe new knowledge gained by Dr. Kiss and his team is also relevant for how plants could behave on Earth. As he notes: “I'm a firm believer that if you do good basic research, ultimately that'll be applied to practical applications. Growing plants on the Moon or Mars will be under stressful environments. There are also plenty of stressful environments on earth, especially now due to climate change and increased salinity in soil. So, I think understanding how plants adapt to microgravity responses, or how their gene expression changes in space, can be applied to stressful conditions on Earth.”\n\nDr Kiss’ investigations were supported by NASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences (BPS) Division as part of its mission to pioneer scientific discovery and enable exploration.

Attendees of the Materials Science in Space Workshop gathered at the 2019 International Space Station Research and Development Conference in Atlanta to help define the next generation of materials research, including investigations and technology development to expand human exploration and scientific discovery farther into the solar system.\n\nProducing metals, glasses, and composites that will stand up to the rigors of spaceflight is important to the future of space exploration, as is creating manufacturing techniques that can make new tools and supplies aboard a spacecraft or on the surface of an uninhabited planet. The workshop participants explored a number of Earth applications as well, including stronger glasses, fiber optics, polymers, improving the flow of molten metals, lubrication, and pharmaceuticals.\n\nNASA’s Space Life and Physical Sciences Research and Applications (SLPSRA) Division and the International Space Station U.S. National Laboratory jointly conducted the workshop as part of the conference sponsored by the National Lab. Researchers from academia, industry, and government agencies gathered to discuss future materials science research opportunities aboard the space station relevant to both NASA and the National Lab’s goals. Experiments sponsored by the National Lab focus on improving the quality of life on Earth, and experiments sponsored by SLPSRA aim at both improving life on Earth and enabling human space exploration, including the development of new spaceflight technologies and furthering fundamental science.\n\nThe orbiting laboratory is aunique platformwith access to conditions to enable research that can both benefit life on Earth and build the knowledge necessary to live and work farther from our home planet. Researchers can conduct long-duration experiments aboard the space station to find out how lack of gravity affects the microstructure and properties of their research. Outside the station, scientists can also study how materials degrade when exposed to the harsh environment of space, such as temperature extremes, intense ultraviolet radiation, and vacuum conditions. Storage space and research time on the station is extremely limited, requiring careful consideration and planning of both resources and research priorities.\n\nThe workshop participants discussed potential future investigations, research areas in need of further exploration, gaps in existing research capabilities on the station, and proposed recommendations. Breakout sessions covered functional materials, materials characteristics, and materials science to inform operations on the lunar surface. The sessions also addressed advanced manufacturing techniques, including 3-D printing to create critical supplies and new materials where needed, and other ways to use resources of new worlds, such as transforming lunar dust into building materials for roads and dwellings.\n\nAnother major topic was using the microgravity environment of the space station to reveal the underlying physics of manufacturing processes, especially heat transfer and the transport of atoms from one place to another. Scientists plan to use data from fundamental physics research aboard station to create baselines and reference databases that will improve the way we make new materials both on Earth and in space.\n\nParticipants proposed new hardware and facilities aboard the station and asked NASA and the National Lab to help create working groups to further explore and develop ideas. They also asked the National Lab and SLPSRA to create more funding opportunities and to establish a dedicated materials science research program for the space station, where most of the proposed experiments will take place.\n\nSLPSRA and the National Lab are reviewing feedback from participants and considering how best to prioritize and implement recommendations. This workshop helped the space science community bring sustained human exploration beyond our planet closer to reality.\n\nPresentations from the workshop and a report summarizing the workshop are available at the National Lab’s website:\n\nhttps://www.issnationallab.org/workshops/2019-materials-in-space/.\n\nStay informedon other exciting SLPSRA research initiatives:\n\nhttps://science.nasa.gov/biological-physical\n\nFor daily updates, follow @ISS_Research,Space Station Research and Technology Newsorour Facebook.Follow theISS National Labfor information on its sponsored investigations.

To thrive in deep space, it’s essential for astronauts to have access to nutrient-rich foods. Currently, they take most of what they need to consume with them from Earth. However, as missions grow longer and take humans farther away from Earth’s surface, it will be important for the crew to reliably grow plants in altered microgravity conditions to help supplement their diet and to create a pleasing environment that reminds them of home.\n\nWhen SpaceX’s 25th cargo resupply mission for NASA (SpX-25) launches to the International Space Station, the cargo Dragon spacecraft will be carrying an important space biology investigation that has the potential to change how we grow and maintain crops both in space and here on Earth.\n\nTheDynamics of Microbiomes in Space(DynaMoS) experiment revolves around studying microscopic organisms that we currently have very little knowledge of. The earliest signs of life forms on Earth first appeared over three billion years ago. These microorganisms, or microbes, eventually became the precursors to all life that thrives on this planet today. Since they first emerged, microbes have evolved drastically to utilize the resources that are available to them, and soil is one of the most complex habitats consisting of diverse microbial life.\n\nSoil microbes are essential for cycling carbon and other nutrients to support plant growth, which is critical for supporting all life.\n\nGrowing crops anywhere has its challenges. Aside from unpredictable weather, one of the many issues that farmers face on Earth is balancing carbon sequestration in soil — meaning they need to ensure that the soil has the right amount of carbon to produce a successful harvest. Soil conservation is essential for farmers since it focuses on replacing the nutrients lost in the soil from growing crops (such as corn) which strips the soil of nutrients. In order to replace what has been lost by farming, farmers must find ways to replace the carbon in order to successfully grow their next round of crops.\n\nThe same practice of balancing the right amount of carbon in soil to create proper plant growth conditions also applies in space.\n\nEnsuring that plant growth can be reliable and sustainable is an important part of space exploration, which is why researching the microorganism communities within the soil is a fundamental step towards thriving in deep space.DynaMoSwill examine how microgravity and other factors affects metabolic interactions in communities of soil microbes. This investigation will focus on the soil microorganism communities that decompose chitin, the second most abundant carbon polymer on Earth.\n\n“Farmers on Earth face challenges with weather changes, balancing carbon levels in soil, and other unpredictable forces, but growing crops in space is a whole different playing field,” explains Dr. Mamta Patel Nagaraja, deputy program scientist for space biology for NASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences (BPS) division. “One factor that is key is understanding how soil microbes perform and function in microgravity since they heavily affect the carbon and nutrient levels. Understanding the behavior of these microbes in spaceflight has the potential to improve agricultural production for long duration space travel, including to other planets, and of course, farming right here on Earth.”\n\nThe results of this research could potentially improve our limited understanding of the function of soil microorganism communities in space while also optimizing these communities to better support agricultural production on Earth. Additionally, the results could help support the design of future space gardens that will rely on the natural processes carried out by soil microorganisms, paving the way for future space exploration missions and for future space farmers.\n\nNASA’sBiological and Physical Sciences Divisionpioneers scientific discovery and enables exploration by using space environments to conduct investigations not possible on Earth. Studying biological and physical phenomenon under extreme conditions allows researchers to advance the fundamental scientific knowledge required to go farther and stay longer in space, while also benefitting life on Earth.\n\nWebb is the premier observatory of the next decade, serving thousands of astronomers worldwide.

These systems—including nuclear fission power systems for missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond; vapor compression heat pumps to support Lunar and Martian habitats; and systems to provide thermal control and advanced life support onboard spacecraft—will require advanced heat transfer capabilities to execute the thermal control required.\n\nA team sponsored by NASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences Division is developing a new technology that will not only achieve orders-of-magnitude improvement in heat transfer to enable these systems to maintain proper temperatures in space, but will also enable significant reductions in size and weight of the hardware. What’s more, this same technology may make owning an electric-powered car here on Earth easier and more feasible.\n\nA team led by led by Issam Mudawar, Purdue University’s Betty Ruth and Milton B. Hollander Family Professor of Mechanical Engineering, has developed the Flow Boiling and Condensation Experiment (FBCE) to enable two-phase fluid flow and heat transfer experiments to be conducted in the long-duration microgravity environment on the International Space Station.\n\nThe FCBE’s Flow Boiling Module includes heat-generating devices mounted along the walls of a flow channel into which coolant is supplied in liquid state. As these devices heat up, the temperature of the liquid in the channel increases, and eventually the liquid adjacent to the walls starts to boil. The boiling liquid forms small bubbles at the walls that depart from the walls at high frequency, constantly drawing liquid from the inner region of the channel toward the channel walls (see figure below). This process efficiently transfers heat by taking advantage of both the liquid’s lower temperature and the ensuing change of phase from liquid to vapor. This process is greatly ameliorated when the liquid supplied to the channel is in a subcooled state (i.e., well below the boiling point).  This new “subcooled flow boiling” technique results in greatly improved heat transfer effectiveness compared to other approaches and could be used to control the temperatures of future systems in space.\n\nFBCE was tested and delivered to the Station in August 2021 and began providing microgravity flow boiling data in early 2022.  Results from these FBCE experiments will enable the design of future space systems that require temperature control, but this technology also has applications on Earth—specifically, it could make owning an electric car more appealing.\n\nBefore electric cars can become widely used, certain challenges must be overcome. First, a network of charging stations must be deployed along highways and roads to enable charging of electric vehicles. Second, the time required to charge a vehicle must be reduced. Currently, charging times vary widely, from 20 minutes at a station alongside a roadway to hours using an at-home charging station.  Lengthy charging times and charger location are both cited as major concerns of people who are considering electric vehicle ownership.\n\nAn electric vehicle charging system contains a charging cable ending with a plug that is inserted into the vehicle’s charging inlet.  The electrical current supplied through the charging cable is delivered to the battery inside to the vehicle, which powers the vehicle’s electric motor.  The passage of electrical current through any conductor results in a finite amount of heat generation, and the higher the current, the greater the heat generated.  A charging station conductor typically consists of a bundle of wires and due to temperature limits, charging cables for conventional, 350-ampere, “fast charging” systems require sizable conductors, rendering the charging cable quite heavy and inconvenient for customers to maneuver.  The cable weight is also increased by the large charging connector and liquid coolant passing through the cable to remove the heat.\n\nReducing the charging time for electric vehicles to five minutes (an industry goal) will require charging systems to provide current at 1,400 amperes. Currently, advanced chargers only deliver currents up to 520 amperes, and most chargers available to consumers support currents of less than 150 amperes. Charging systems providing 1,400 amperes will generate significantly more heat than current systems, however, and will require improved methods to control temperature.\n\nRecently, Mudawar’s team applied the “subcooled flow boiling” principles learned from the NASA FBCE experiments to the electric vehicle charging process. Using this new technology, dielectric (non-electrically conducting) liquid coolant is pumped through the charging cable, where it captures the heat generated by the current-carrying conductor.  Subcooled flow boiling allows Mudawar’s team to deliver 4.6 times the current of the fastest available electric vehicle chargers on the market today by removing up to 24.22 kilowatts of heat.  Purdue’s charging cable can provide 2,400 amperes, which is far beyond the 1,400 amperes required to reduce time required to charge an electric car to five minutes. Application of this new technology resulted in unprecedented reduction of the time required to charge a vehicle and may remove one of the key barriers to worldwide adoption of electric vehicles.\n\nDr. Issam Mudawar, Purdue University\n\nBiological and Physical Sciences Division\n\nA NASA-sponsored team at the University of Iowa (UI) is restoring and advancing the nation’s…\n\nA NASA-sponsored team at the University of Iowa (UI) is restoring and advancing the nation’s…\n\nWebb is the premier observatory of the next decade, serving thousands of astronomers worldwide.

You probably know Sir Isaac Newton from a certain apple story, but you may not know that he lived through a pandemic, just as we are today.\n\nIn 1665, an outbreak of the bubonic plague caused Newton’s school to close, leading him to study from home for two years. He went on to make one of the discoveries he is most famous for: that the same force acts upon all objects in the universe; and he was able to represent this phenomenon mathematically, establishing his law of universal gravitation. Newton’s findings on areas including gravity have shaped our understanding of the universe and continue to impact our work in space today.\n\nAt home on Earth, gravity makes our lives so much easier. With this force governing our world, our muscles are naturally strengthened because they have to support our body weight, and water doesn’t float up into the air around us after we pour it into a glass. But to accomplish our goal of thriving in space, we have to adapt to living and working without forces like gravity acting upon us. That’s where our work at BPS comes in.\n\nMuch of our research focuses on how fundamental biological and physical processes are affected by gravity — or the lack of it. We study how the space environment impacts biological processes like cell function and plant growth, as well as physical processes such as combustion and fluid movement. Now is a particularly exciting time for us, as we’re providing scientists a once in a decadeopportunityto help shape the future of transformative science research.\n\nThe insights gathered from our studies in space help inform the science needed to address the problems we face on Earth as well. For example, NASA’s research on bone and muscle loss aboard the International Space Station could contribute to medical advancements for preventing and treating diseases like osteoporosis. Developing ways to grow plants in space gives us tools for raising crops under the most difficult conditions on our home planet.\n\nIn fact, you have probably already experienced some of the benefits of our space-tested work back on Earth, like LED bulbs to promote plant growth, improvements in firefighting tools, and household products such as shampoos, laundry detergents, and dish soaps.\n\nDuring Newton’s time several centuries ago, the role of gravity was still being defined, whereas today we’re preparing to establish the first long-term presence on the Moon with NASA’sArtemis program.\n\nAs Newton once said, “What we know is a drop, what we don’t know is an ocean.”\n\nFollow us as we, at NASA BPS, investigate ways to go farther and stay longer in space, in order to advance space exploration and enable scientific discovery that benefits life on Earth!\n\nFor more on BPS:https://science.nasa.gov/biological-physicalFollow us on Twitter:https://twitter.com/NASASpaceSci\n\nNASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences Divisionpioneers scientific discovery and enables exploration by using space environments to conduct investigations not possible on Earth.

Congressional and executive branch support for NASA’sArtemisprogram, as well as for future missions to Mars, has led to significant levels of opportunity for scientists and engineers who can now do more than imagine sustaining human life in deep space, they can help make it a reality.\n\nNASA plans on sending the first woman and next man to the Moon by 2024 and enabling sustainable exploration by 2028. The Moon is a natural stepping-stone to Mars, and it is there the agency will demonstrate new technologies, capabilities and business approaches needed for exploration farther into the solar system.\n\nRegolith and dust, deep-space and reflected radiation, reduced gravity, and a closed habitat are a few of the lunar features that will enable unique research opportunities on the Moon. Scientists will conduct experiments under these distinctive conditions to improve methods of fire safety; extract lunar water and oxygen; promote plant growth; enhance closed-loop life support systems and supporting technologies; mitigate the effects of dust on extravehicular activity (EVA) systems and suits, life support systems, and surface construction systems; develop technologies that facilitate the extraction, synthesis and processing of minerals, metals and other materials; and more.\n\nThus, there is a unified vision and high levels of collaboration across NASA directorates: Human Exploration and Operations, Science, and Space Technology. NASA is also engaging outside experts from other international partners, government agencies, commercial industry partners, and academia. The American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR) helps facilitate collaboration and solicit new ideas.\n\nASGSR is a non-profit dedicated to promoting a multidisciplinary approach to research in space. Its members represent academia, government, and industry. The organization brings together a diverse group of scientists and engineers to exchange ideas that advance the understanding of how living organisms and physical systems respond to gravity and other aspects of the spaceflight environment. NASA’s participation in ASGSR’s annual conference in October 2019 focused on discussing specific experiments and findings that will influence the upcoming NASA missions.\n\n“Spaceflight affects Earth-based biological and physical systems in many ways including altered gravity and deep space radiation,” says Dr. Craig Kundrot, director of NASA’s Space Life and Physical Sciences and Applications (SLPSRA) division. “Sustainable human exploration requires research to identify new ways to minimize the risks in spaceflight environments and to maximize the productivity of the missions.”\n\nLanding astronauts on Mars will take great feats of engineering and technology. Sustaining life on another planet, as opposed to the short trips conducted during the Apollo program, also requires scientific advancements. Given the gravitational differences of the Moon and Mars, and the extended duration of space travel, conference participants discussed prioritizing the areas of research and study that could affect the safe transport of astronauts and the establishment of sustainable operations .\n\nAt the conference, top experts were joined by the next generation of scientists, ranging from high schoolers to graduate students. “The ASGSR conference presents a unique opportunity for rising scientists to share the results of their research and to learn the latest developments in their fields and in NASA’s planning,” continues Kundrot. “Our scientific successors will play a key role in continuing the fundamental research that needs to be done to not only get astronauts to and from the Moon and Mars, but also to help them stay — to grow food, recycle water, power a colony, and more.”\n\nNext up in NASA’s mission preparation: theDecadal Surveyfor Life and Physical Sciences in Space. The survey will solicit the science community at large for white papers that will identify leading-edge scientific questions in these fields and the observations required to answer them. SLPSRA will then commission research resulting directly from the Decadal Survey recommendations.\n\nConsiderable work remains. Developing sustainable operations on the Moon and Mars requires the contributions of scientists representing a broad range of disciplines. It involves deep examination of the risks and challenges such missions can pose, as well as the means to mitigate them. Sustained exploration requires extensive collaboration across industry, academia, government, and international partners — when we go to the Moon,we go together. Thus, the ideas exchanged at ASGSR and the white papers submitted through the Decadal Survey will be instrumental in influencing and supporting NASA’s future missions.\n\nSubmit proposalsfor theDecadal SurveyWatchthe2019 ASGSR Annual Meeting webcast recordingLearn moreaboutASGSRLearn moreaboutNASA’S Artemis programStay informedon other excitingSLPSRAresearch initiatives\n\nFor daily updates, follow @ISS_Research,Space Station Research and Technology Newsorour Facebook.

However, there is strong evidence to believe this theory may not be complete and that there are unknown forces at play. These new physics effects may manifest themselves in small deviations from Einstein’s prediction.\n\nTheACES (Atomic Clock Ensemble in Space) investigationis an ESA (European Space Agency) mission that aims to help answer fundamental physics questions. By comparing a highly precise atomic clock in space with numerous ground atomic clocks around the world, ACES could take global time synchronization and clock comparison experiments to new heights.\n\nSponsored by NASA, United States scientists are participating in the mission in various ways, including contributing ground station reference clocks. Scheduled to collect data for 30 months, this vast network of precise clocks is expected to provide fresh insights into the exact relationship between gravity and time, set new limits for unknown forces, and improve global time synchronization.\n\nIn addition to investigating the laws of physics, ACES will enable new terrestrial applications such as relativistic geodesy, which involves measuring Earth's shape and gravitational field with extreme precision. These advancements are critical to space navigation, satellite operations, and GPS systems. For example, without understanding the time fluctuations between Earth and medium Earth orbit, GPS would be progressively less accurate.\n\nProbing Plants for Properties to Protect DNA\n\nTheAPEX-12 (Advanced Plant EXperiment-12) investigationwill test the hypothesis that induction of telomerase activity in space protects plant DNA molecules from damage elicited by cellular stress evoked by the combined spaceflight stressors experienced by seedlings grown aboard the space station. It is expected that results will lead to a better understanding of differences between human and plant telomere behavior in space.\n\nData on telomerase activity in plants could be leveraged not only to develop therapies for age-related diseases in space and on Earth, but also for ensuring food crops are more resilient to spaceflight stress.\n\nTelomeres and telomerase influence cell division and cell death, two processes crucial to understanding aging in humans.Telomeresare the protective end caps of chromosomes. Each time a cell divides, the telomeres shorten slightly, essentially acting as a biological clock for cell aging. Conversely, telomerase is an enzyme that adds nucleotide sequences to the ends of telomeres, lengthening them and counteracting their shortening.\n\nIn humans, telomere shortening is linked to various age-related conditions, such as cardiovascular diseases and certain cancers. In astronauts, studies have shown that spaceflight leads to changes in telomere length, with a notable lengthening observed. This phenomenon carries potential implications for astronaut health outcomes. By contrast, plant telomere length did not change during spaceflight, despite a dramatic increase in telomerase activity.\n\nHow this benefits space exploration:Experiments aboard NASA’s SpaceX CRS-32 mission are twofold. One, they have the potential to significantly enhance precision timekeeping, which is necessary to improve space navigation and communication. Two, they can provide insights into how plants adapt to protect DNA molecules from cellular stress caused by environmental factors experienced in spaceflight, in an effort to sustain plant life in space.\n\nHow this benefits humanity:The experiments conducted on NASA’s SpaceX CRS-32 mission offer a range of potential benefits to humanity. First, improving precision timekeeping for more accurate GPS technology. Second, capturing data about how telomerase activity correlates to cellular stress in plants, which could lead to assays which better correlate telomerase activity and cellular stress and provide fundamental research to contribute to potential therapies for humans.\n\nAtomic Clock Ensemble in Space (ACES) is a European Space Agency (ESA) mission that aims to help answer fundamental physics questions.\n\nAdvanced Plant EXperiment-12 (APEX-12) will test the hypothesis that induction of telomerase, a protein complex, activity in space protects plant DNA molecules from damage elicited by cellular stress evoked by the combined spaceflight stressors experienced by seedlings grown aboard the space station.\n\nAbout BPS\n\nNASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences Divisionpioneers

{"normalized_item": {"type": "news", "source_url": "https://science.nasa.gov/science-research/biological-physical-sciences/preparing-to-take-flight/", "title": "Preparing to Take Flight", "summary": "Conducting research in space is a complex endeavor: applying for funding, working with engineers to develop hardware, preparing and operating the experiment", "published_at": "2022-02-11T09:17:00-05:00", "authors": ["NASA Science Editorial Team"], "tags": ["Science &amp; Research", "Biological & Physical Sciences", "Biological &amp; Physical Sciences"], "body_text": "9 min read\n\nConducting research in space is a complex endeavor: applying for funding, working with engineers to develop hardware, preparing and operating the experiment in space, analyzing data, and more.\n\nSince training for spaceflight experiments isn’t something you typically learn in school, it’s critical that professional scientists leverage the experience of colleagues and mentors. That’s why NASA developed its Spaceflight Technology, Applications and Research (STAR) program — to equip associate and postdoctoral researchers with the insights and information needed to optimize success, from grant writing to experiment design.\n\nStudying biological phenomena in spaceflight environments enables researchers to advance fundamental knowledge in ways not possible on Earth. “For many researchers, the ideal venue might be the International Space Station or even beyond low Earth orbit,” says STAR course co-organizer Dr. Marianne Sowa. “So, there is a lot at stake once an investigation is green-lit. This might be their one chance to run an experiment in space, so it’s essential that we help them lay the groundwork for success.”\n\n“Our participants learn both fundamental space biology and the practical aspects or planning a spaceflight experiment,” adds Dr. Egle Cekanaviciute, STAR course director and a scientist with the Space Biosciences Research Division atNASA’s Ames Research Center. “By the end of the course they have a solid foundation of knowledge and, perhaps even more importantly, they know where to go with their questions.”\n\n“Part of the process includes looking at the potential limitations of a proposed investigation,” continues Cekanaviciute. “For example, you wouldn’t expect to send 100 mice to the space station and do the analysis the moment they land. This is not the way it works, but if you aren’t in the field or at a NASA center you wouldn’t know that.”\n\nOriginally developed as an in-person Space Biosciences program to be held at Ames prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, STAR was quickly converted to a virtual format. This pivot enabled researchers from around the world to participate in the program, who otherwise may not have had the opportunity. “We found the virtual format to be a fantastic way to bring the science community together and grow the spaceflight community around the world,” says Dr. Lisa Carnell, STAR course co-organizer.\n\nThroughout the course, participants hear from academic researchers NASA experts, commercial spaceflight providers, and peers on variety of topics designed to enable researchers to design and progress their investigations in space biology. “One of the aspects of the course that I am the most proud of is the community of participants that we are building and the connections they establish with the more senior researchers who are our seminar speakers,” says Cekanaviciute. STAR ‘graduates’ couldn’t agree more and share other highlights from their experiences below.\n\n“The diversity of topics covered in the course curriculum and the ability to receive additional advice for seeking grant funding and preparing for spaceflight experiments. I also thought it would be a good opportunity to network with other scientists in the space biology field and potentially collaborate together on future research projects too.”\n\n“As an early career researcher entering the field of Space Biology, this course seemed incredibly valuable to gain greater context and perspective to shape my research and find valuable insights from people directly working with Space flight missions.”\n\n“Each of us lives in that small ‘research bubble,’ focused on very specific cells or systems. The fascination of the program was to broaden my horizon. Hearing about octopuses in space, while thinking about the astronaut microbiome, and in the next session learning about grant funding mechanism is a privilege.”\n\n“Designing experiments on Earth may not translate successfully to experiments in space, given the lack of gravity and how materials may behave. The understanding of how to undertake a multilayer approach in order to execute an experiment, from designing a hypothesis that is relevant to the risks associated with space health and the possible benefits to life on Earth, would not have been possible without this carefully crafted program.”\n\n“I was surprised to discover the accessibility of space biosciences to new investigators. Through small-group meetings with flight integration companies, I learned about the remarkable hardware and spaceflight logistics expertise available. In addition, I found that the space biology community was open to sharing the lessons learned from their own experiences.”\n\n“I was already working on grant applications. Some of the criticisms I could directly address using new knowledge taught and discussed during our STAR sessions. The review of experiments, hardware, grant applications, payload, and data sharing were invaluable, too, especially while being in the midst of the grant writing process.”\n\n* Dr. Schwertz was awarded aSpace Biology grantfor a flight mission to study the effects of spaceflight on human blood cells, called megakaryocytes. It was his third resubmission, which was successfully granted after his completion of the STAR program.\n\n“One of the most interesting sessions was the meeting with the implementation partners and researchers that have conducted spaceflight experiments and the one-on-one discussions. Each partner highlighted their capabilities and the limitations of what can be done in a space environment, allowing us to rethink of how we could possibly conduct our own experiments.”\n\n“The STAR course has given me additional contemporary topic ideas to share with the students enrolled in my undergraduate course. I’ve also been able to meet other scientists whose science I hope to feature and whom I would like to invite to guest-lecture in my undergraduate course.”\n\n“By being part of this course, I can connect with peers and mentors around the world. The topics of each week’s seminars are of immense relevance to our ongoing space biology payload development. I am able to get personalized feedback to some of the queries about our project’s development and get a holistic perspective of mission design, development, and execution. The learnings will certainly help me train my team to carry out several successful flight as well as ground control experiments and chart out a near-midterm research strategy for the work ahead.”\n\n“The collaborative culture created through this program ensures that we could all reach out to one another and take advantage of our individual expertise in future proposals and interpretation of results.”\n\n“The STAR program included grant writing workshops during which participants could receive feedback on space biology-relevant projects. The feedback I got from NASA scientists and other participants about my research proposals has been instrumental in my development of space biology projects. The STAR program has revealed a new world of research opportunities that will be transformative for my career.”\n\n“This program is one of the best uses of your time if you are interested in space research. Try to think about your goals upfront, start thinking about the grant you would love to propose, on or before the first session. Be openminded about other disciplines, which will make the research application more rounded, more impactful, and create increased enthusiasm amongst reviewers.”\n\n“Take advantage of the fantastic collaboration opportunities available through the program, including with those who have direct spaceflight research experience. The collective expertise available in the space biology community can mitigate the unique challenges of this research and facilitate exciting new discoveries.”\n\nSpaceflight Technology, Applications and Research (STAR) is a virtual NASA program for space biosciences training. The annual course targets principal investigators (PIs), senior research scientists, and postdoctoral scholars and aims to facilitate their entry to space biology and preparation for conducting spaceflight experiments using NASA and commercial platforms.\n\nCourse curriculum includes fundamental space biology and its practical applications, including technical and logistical considerations, opportunities, and the unique advantages and limitations of conducting an experiment in space. Course participants also have opportunities to interact with PIs with prior mission experience, developers of spaceflight technology, and flight providers. Applications for the next class will open in March of 2022, with classes to be held weekly from September 2022 through February 2023.\n\nSTAR-1 (2020-2021) CohortSTAR-2 (2021-2022) Cohort\n\nNASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences Divisionpioneers scientific discovery and enables exploration by using space environments to conduct investigations not possible on Earth.

In the 1970s, aboutone-third of peoplein developing countries were undernourished; today the number is 13 percent. Even as global population has increased, it has been a long time since the horrific famines that claimed 5 million lives or morein the Soviet Union, China, Europe, and Indiaduring the 20th Century.\n\nHowever, serious food shortages remain a fact of life. Roughly 815 million people were undernourished in 2016,accordingto the UN Food and Agricultural Organization. That is anincrease of 38 million peoplefrom 2015, making 2016 the first year in more than a decade that the world grew hungrier. The grim trend was driven largely by armed conflicts in South Sudan, Yemen, Nigeria, and Syria.\n\nMeanwhile, other problems loom. Climate change is already starting to exacerbate famines, as temperature and precipitation patterns shift.Many experts worrythat food production systems may struggle to adapt in coming decades. Even if problems caused by climate change turn out to be modest, global populations are expected to increase to 10 billion people by 2050, and the demand for food will likely go up by50 percent or moreas people in the developing world increase their income and consume foods that requiremore resources to produce.\n\nSolving global problems sometimes requires a global view, soNASA’s Applied Sciences Programis working to make sure the world’s food systems are ready for the future. Researchers and program managers have created an agency-wide initiative to put remote sensing data and knowledge into the hands of people who can advance agriculture and reduce world hunger.\n\nEarth Matters sat down withSean McCartney, the coordinator of NASA’s newFood Security Office, to learn more.\n\nMcCartney: People sometimes forget thatNASA’s charterstates that one of the agency’s key objectives is “the expansion of human knowledge of the Earth and of phenomena in the atmosphere and space.” There are currently around 20 Earth-observing satellites that collect data on the hydrosphere, biosphere, and atmosphere. NASA has been able to leverage this data through scientific analysis and modeling to better understand food systems on a global scale.\n\nThe food security initiative is part of our Applied Sciences Program, which does outreach with end users and showcases Earth observations. Through this program, NASA began to work with the United Nationson Sustainable Development Goals (SGDs), a global effort to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all. Some of the goals relate to water and food security, and NASA leadership believed that that was an area where Earth observations could really contribute. Getting involved with the SGDs dovetailed with the establishment of the Food Security Office.\n\nWe already do a lot with satellites to monitor major commodity crops like rice, maize, wheat, and soy. We can use satellites to help track key crop characteristics, such as the“greenness” of vegetation (NDVI), crop type, the acreage and distribution of crops, precipitation, soil moisture, evapotranspiration, and more. This sort of environmental data is incorporated into important crop assessment reports, such as theGEOGLAM Crop Monitor, a monthly bulletin on conditions for major crops around the world.\n\nLikewise, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) uses satellite data as part of itsFamine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET), which produces frequent reports on food conditions in 34 of the most famine-prone countries in the world.\n\nWhat we’re trying to do is optimize programs and tools like these — and develop others — and get them into the right hands at the right time. NASA assets help inform governments, NGOs, the private sector, and other stakeholders to anticipate and react to food shortages.\n\nA lot of our efforts so far have been through theEarth Observations for Food Security and Agriculture Consortium (EOFSAC), a program led by the University of Maryland. It really is a multidisciplinary group, which is what makes the program so exciting. The consortium has roughly 40 partner organizations from government, NGOs, international organizations, universities, and the private sector all working together. You can see a fulllist of the partners here.\n\nPartnering with both the private and public sector—for instance, USDA and USAID—is one focus. They are going to be looking at innovative ways where Earth observations can provide value to end users. That might involve working with the reinsurance industry to provide them with a broad view of crops or working with USDA’sNational Agricultural Statistics Serviceto develop ways of incorporating more satellite data into their workflow.\n\nIn February 2018, the consortiumsponsored a workshopat the National Agricultural Library focusing on emerging technologies in Earth observations. Presenters highlighted several new sensors and data sets that are now being applied to agriculture — such as soil moisture, solar induced fluorescence, and satellite-derived precipitation. For a full account of the meeting, you canread the minutes here.\n\nYes. A lot of what the folks at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies are doing is modeling that assimilates Earth observations into long-term forecasts. They’re studying how climate change will affect crop productivity in the future. There’s an international effort called theAgricultural Model Intercomparison Project(AGMIP) that is focused on this and is a rich source of information.\n\nIt really depends on the country. If you look at overall food production, even in countries that are in need, they might be producing adequate food, but they don’t have access to markets, so they can’t get that food to people before it spoils.\n\nYes, check out@EOFSAC,@GEOCropMonitor,@FEWSNET,@G20_GEOGLAM, and@AgMIPnews.\n\nThis piece was originally published on NASA Earth Observatory'sEarth Mattersblog.\n\nExplore Earth

This research, combined withother studieson the health and performance of Artemis II astronauts, will give NASA insight into how to best protect astronauts as exploration expands to the surface of the Moon, Mars, and beyond.\n\nNicky Fox\n\nAssociate Administrator, NASA Science Mission Directorate\n\n“AVATARis NASA’s visionary tissue chip experiment that will revolutionize the very way we will do science, medicine, and human multi-planetary exploration,” said Nicky Fox, associate administrator, Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington. “Each tissue chip is a tiny sample uniquely created so that we can examine how the effects of deep space act on each human explorer before we go to ensure we pack the appropriate medical supplies tailored to each individual’s needs as we travel back to the Moon, and onward to Mars.”\n\nThe investigationis a collaboration between NASA, government agencies, and industry partners, leveraging commercial expertise to gain a deeper understanding of human biology and disease. This research could accelerate innovations in personalized healthcare, both for astronauts in space and patients on Earth.\n\nOrgan chips, also referred to as tissue chips or microphysiological systems, are roughly the size of a USB thumb drive and used to help understand — and then predict — how an individual might respond to a variety of stressors, such as radiation or medical treatments, including pharmaceuticals. Essentially, these small devices serve as “avatars” for human organs.\n\nOrgan chips contain living human cells that are grown to model the structures and functions of specific regions in human organs, such as the brain, lungs, heart, pancreas, and liver — they can beat like a heart, breathe like a lung, or metabolize like a liver. Tissue chips can be linked together to mimic how organs interact with each other, which is important for understanding how the whole human body responds to stressors or treatments.\n\nResearchers and oncologists use human tissue chips today to understand how a specific patient’s cancer might react to different drugs or radiation treatments. To date, a standard milestone for organs-on-chips has been to keep human cells healthy for 30 days. However, NASA and other research institutions are pushing these boundaries by increasing the longevity of organ chips to a minimum of six months so that scientists can observe diseases and drug therapies over a longer period.\n\nTheArtemis II missionwill use organ chips created using blood-forming stem and progenitor cells, which originate in the bone marrow, from Artemis II crew members.\n\nBone marrow is among the organs most sensitive to radiation exposure and, therefore, of central importance to human spaceflight. It also plays a vital role in the immune system, as it is the origin of all adult red and white blood cells, which is why researchers aim to understand how deep space radiation affects this organ.\n\nStudies have shown that microgravity affects the development of bone marrow cells. Although the International Space Station operates in low Earth orbit, which is shielded from most cosmic and solar radiation by the Earth’s magnetosphere, astronauts often experience a loss of bone density. Given that Artemis II crew will be flying beyond this protective layer,AVATARresearchers also seek to understand how the combined stressors of deep space radiation and microgravity affect the developing cells.\n\nTo make the bone marrow organ chips, Artemis II astronauts will first donate platelets to a local healthcare system. The cells remaining from their samples will contain a small percentage of bone marrow-derived stem and progenitor cells. NASA-funded scientists at Emulate, Inc., which developed the organ chip technology used inAVATAR, will purify these cells with magnetic beads that bind specifically to them. The purified cells will then be placed in the bone marrow chips next to blood vessel cells and other supporting cells to model the structure and function of the bone marrow.\n\nInvestigating how radiation affects the bone marrow can provide insights into how radiation therapy and other DNA-damaging agents, such as chemotherapeutic drugs, impair blood cell formation. Its significance for both spaceflight and medicine on Earth makes the bone marrow an ideal organ to study in theArtemis II AVATAR project.\n\n“For NASA, organ chips could provide vital data for protecting astronaut health on deep space missions,” said Lisa Carnell, director of NASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences division at NASA Headquarters. “As we go farther and stay longer in space, crew will have only limited access to on-site clinical healthcare. Therefore, it’ll be critical to understand if there are unique and specific healthcare needs of each astronaut, so that we can send the right supplies with them on future missions.”\n\nDuring the Artemis II mission, the organ chips will be secured in a custom payload developed by Space Tango and mounted inside the capsule during the mission. The battery-powered payload will maintain automated environmental control and media delivery to the organ chips throughout the flight.\n\nLisa Carnell\n\nDirector of NASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences Division\n\nUpon return, researchers at Emulate will examine how spaceflight affected the bone marrow chips by performing single-cell RNA sequencing, a powerful technique that measures how thousands of genes change within individual cells. The scientists will compare data from the flight samples to measurements of crew cells used in a ground-based immunology study happening simultaneously. This will provide the most detailed look at the impact of spaceflight and deep space radiation on developing blood cells to date.\n\nNASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences Divisionpioneers scientific discovery and enables exploration by using space environments to conduct investigations not possible on Earth. Studying biological and physical phenomenon under extreme conditions allows researchers to advance the fundamental scientific knowledge required to go farther and stay longer in space, while also benefitting life on Earth.\n\nGoals\n\nPrecision Health\n\nAVATAR\n\nQuantum Leaps", "ocr_text": "", "media_assets": ["https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/NASA_logo.png?w=300",

Soon", "published_at": "2022-12-07T09:33:00-05:00", "authors": ["NASA Science Editorial Team"], "tags": ["Science &amp; Research", "Biological & Physical Sciences", "Biological &amp; Physical Sciences"], "body_text": "5 min read\n\nAfter 908 days in low Earth orbit, a small package on board the X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle-6 has come home to the delight of some biological scientists. Soon they will open an aluminum alloy container that holds samples of plant seeds that they hope can be used to sustain astronauts on long duration missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond.\n\nOfficially, it is known as a SEER experiment, short for Space Environment Exposure Research, a pathfinder mission supported by NASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences Division (BPS) in collaboration with the US Air Force.\n\nUnofficially, they’re referred to as the “Thrive in Space” experiments – a way to underscore the stepping-stone research that scientists are undertaking to help advance their fundamental understanding of what it takes to grow and protect plants beyond our planet.\n\nSpace Biology Scientists Dr. Ye Zhang and Dr. Howard Levine, with NASA’s BPS Division, will advise a team of researchers who will begin to study these seeds shortly after their arrival.\n\nQ:What kinds of plant seeds did you send into orbit?\n\nZhang:“We chose seeds from 12 plant species or subspecies, including thale cress and purple false brome, which will serve as model organisms. For crops, there were seeds from mizuna mustard, pak choi, lettuce, tomato, radish, chili pepper, Swiss chard, onions, dwarf rice, dwarf wheat, and cucumber.”\n\nQ:Many of those plant seeds have already been germinated, grown, and studied on board the International Space Station. What new information are you trying to get from this mission?\n\nZhang:“We want to see what happens to these seeds after they’re exposed to a variety of space radiation over a long period of time. As a basis of comparison, we’ve examined how seeds react to high levels of radiation; we’ve conducted a number of seed experiments at Brookhaven National Laboratory where we’ve observed how they change behaviors as a result of being subjected to controlled radiation exposure. And, we’ve seen how they react to a lower radiation dose for a limited time on board the space station. But we’ve never subjected them to the multiple types of space radiation bombardment that you’ll find in space over a long period of time. Remember, when we have a round trip to Mars, we’ll be traveling for two or maybe three years, so we want to determine how long these seeds can be stored and still be viable.”\n\nQ:What are the challenges to growing Is crops in space?\n\nLevine:“The biggest challenge is the room you need to grow these edibles. Just to give you a general number, it would take about 50 square meters of soil to provide enough food for one person. So, as we transport our crew members to Mars, the plants we grow will provide them with a token amount of their nutritional needs. That said, there’s an often overlooked or minimized aspect to growing plants in space and that’s the psychological benefit to our crew members; they’ve often told us when they’re able to take care of the plants on board the space station, they really appreciate it as gives them a remembrance of what it’s like on Earth.\n\nAlso remember, you don’t just grow plants for food: They also suck up carbon dioxide which we normally have to do by chemical means. Plants purify the water that’s passed through them. Oh, and by the way, they also produce oxygen.”\n\nQ:Are there any potential benefits from your experiments that could benefit current horticultural methods on Earth?\n\nLevine:“We’re now in what we call the ‘omics’ era, where we look at how genes are differentially expressed under microgravity conditions and eventually under partial gravity. We’re learning about which genes are turned on more, or less, or the same amount as they are on Earth. And all that has great implications for the metabolism and physiology of the plants. That can be very enlightening for horticultural applications on Earth.”\n\nQ:To sum up, what are the top things you’d like researchers to know about your seed radiation experiments?\n\nZhang: “First, we’re working on deep-space crop production capabilities, and that includes testing space exposure impact. Second, we may be able to share some of these seeds with the science community. Certainly, the data we collect from our experiments will be transparent for anyone to see. But, in certain circumstances, I’m hoping we’ll be able to share the actual seeds with other researchers to further our knowledge about growing seeds in inhospitable or extreme conditions.”\n\nLevine:“Once the seeds return, there are three primary areas we’ll want to explore. First is germination; the beginning of growth. We want to know if there’s a reduced germination percentage of the seeds that have spent many long months being bombarded with higher levels of radiation compared to our ground control experiments. Next is the morphology – the seed’s form and structure. Once we get seedlings, we want to see how they differ from the ground control group. We’ve already radiated seeds at our Brookhaven National Laboratory in Long Island and have seen a number that developed mutations, so we’ll be looking for that from our seeds exposed to spaceflight conditions for a prolonged interval. Third, we’ll be conducting ‘omics’ analyses of the seedling tissues obtained from the germinated seeds, to see which plant genes may have been under expressed or overexpressed.”\n\nPlanning for Future Missions\n\nWhen this small container of seeds returns, the first SEER experiment will increase our knowledge about the impact of space radiation, one of the major risks associated with crop production.  By developing ways to mitigate this risk, scientists will enable plants to “Thrive in Space”, a critical undertaking for the success of future interplanetary missions and establishing permanently inhabited bases.\n\nStay informed on other exciting BPS research initiatives at:https://science.nasa.gov/biological-physical\n\nWebb is the premier observatory of the next decade, serving thousands of astronomers worldwide.

This program element is part of Science Mission Directorate (SMD) Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences - 2021 (ROSES-2021) solicitation. These five research projects, involving recognized experts in the fields of combustion science, complex fluids, fluid physics, informatics, and materials science, will use data contained in the PSI system and build on prior reduced-gravity research to advance fundamental research in the physical sciences.\n\nResearchers will investigate important problems with existing data from NASA’sPhysical Sciences Informatics(PSI) system. The online database contains data from completed physical science reduced-gravity flight experiments conducted on theInternational Space Station, Space Shuttle flights, free flying spacecraft, commercial cargo flights to and from the space station, or from related ground-based studies.\n\nOne of the selected studies will use In-Space Soldering Investigation (ISSI) experiment to investigate and improve our understanding of how porosity develops in the solder joints, how it is influenced by gravity, and how solder joints properties and functions are affected. The proposed work would apply advanced 3D materials characterization to solder samples from ISSI and non-ISSI compositions. The additional characterization may feedback into the design of the next generation of on-orbit experiments for soldering, essential for future long-duration human exploration missions. This project is led by Prof. Siddartha Pathak (Iowa State University, Ames).\n\nAnother selected investigation, seeks to develop the ATOMTMtoolbox, a simple computer vision, data analytics and machine learning tool, to expand the meaning and interpretation of existing microgravity data in the PSI system. The results of the project will provide the means for users to better interact with the data, standardize data output and perform insightful analysis on selected datasets to increase the science readiness of investigations. The project is led by Dr. Ioana Cozmuta (G-Space, Inc).\n\nThe selected proposals are from five institutions in five states, with the total combined award amount of approximately $999K during a two-year period.\n\nThe Physical Sciences Research Program is managed by theBiological and Physical Sciences Divisionin NASA's Science Mission Directorate. This program conducts fundamental and applied physical sciences research, with the objective of pioneering scientific discovery, enabling space exploration, and providing benefits on Earth. The program furthers fundamental research by investigating the fundamental laws of the universe and physical phenomena in the absence of gravity. The program also conducts applied research, which contributes to the basic understanding underlying space exploration technologies that will further our return to the Moon and our journey to Mars and beyond. Both have led to improved space systems or new products on Earth.\n\nBelow is the complete list of the selected proposals, principal investigators, and their organizations:\n\nWebb is the premier observatory of the next decade, serving thousands of astronomers worldwide. It studies every phase in the…\n\nThis rover and its aerial sidekick were assigned to study the geology of Mars and seek signs of ancient microbial…\n\nOn a mission to “touch the Sun,” NASA's Parker

The event, held on April 17, 2020, was co-led by Dr. Afshin Beheshti, with KBRwyle (NASA’s Ames Research Center), and Dr. Todd Treangen of Rice University in Houston, Texas. This virtual symposium enabled scientists from around to the world to discuss the data and work on how the findings may be used to effectively combat the viral disease and protect people from infection.\n\nThe Facebook live event was the culmination of work by the COVID-19 International Research Team (COV-IRT), which was formed on March 25, 2020. The formation of COV-IRT was a grassroots effort initiated by a multidisciplinary group of scientists from around the world who are members of the NASA GeneLab Multi-Omics Analysis Working Group (AWG).\n\nCOV-IRT’s purpose is to use cutting- edge systems biology analyses coupled to virological and physiological methods to understand the disease process of the COVID-19 coronavirus. To date, the team’s findings are leading to defining underlying mechanisms for viral infection, especially for high-risk groups, viral transmission, countermeasures for infection, and vaccine targets.  A non-profit organization has been set up by COV-IRT to encourage and enable open science efforts through sample and data sharing and dissemination of information.\n\nFor more on COV-IRT’s coronavirus response efforts:www.COV-IRT.orgNASA GeneLab Multi-Omics Analysis Working GroupWatch the Facebook Live eventFollow COV-IRT on TwitterFollow COV-IRT on FacebookNASA GeneLab\n\nStay informed on space biology & physical sciences research:https://science.nasa.gov/biological-physical\n\nFor daily updates,follow @ISS_Research,Space Station Research and Technology Newsorour Facebook.Follow theISS National Labfor information on its sponsored investigations.For opportunities to see the space station pass over your town, check outSpot the station.\n\nWebb is the premier observatory of the next decade, serving thousands of astronomers worldwide.

Part of that work includes valuable research, as the Moon offers two environments important for science – and to which we do not currently have access down on the ground: The Moon’s gravity is only about one-sixth of Earth’s, and it has a very thin atmosphere which is exposed to more intense radiation than exists on Earth. Additionally, establishing a sustainable presence on the Lunar surface is an essential step towards preparing for missions to Mars.\n\nHowever, before that, to go farther and stay longer in space, including to Mars, we must investigate how biological and physical phenomena behave in the unique environment of the Moon.\n\nTo pave the way for human exploration of the Moon, Mars, and beyond, NASA’s Artemis missions are set up as a series of increasingly complex missions. The first, Artemis I will be an uncrewed test flight of the Space Launch System (SLS) and the Orion spacecraft around the Moon. The primary goals for this test flight are to demonstrate Orion’s systems and thus ensure a safe journey to the Moon and back for the first crewed flight on Artemis II.\n\nThough uncrewed, the crew compartment of Artemis I will have minuscule biological life forms aboard, along with other scientific payloads. Some of these tiny travelers aboard Orion make up NASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences’Biological Experiment 01 (BioExpt-01)mission which will serve as a pathfinder for biological research beyond low-Earth orbit.\n\nBioExpt-01 includes four investigations that will evaluate effects of the deep space environment on the nutritional value of plant seeds, DNA repair within fungi, adaptation of yeast, and algal gene expression. By sending these investigations through two giant donuts of radiation around Earth called the Van Allen Belts — to areas beyond low-Earth orbit — researchers will gain understanding of the elevated levels and impacts of ionizing radiation on biological life forms like never before. This knowledge will help us to understand how biological life forms can better thrive in deep space and support future manned missions to the Moon and Mars.\n\nSending humans back to the Moon and eventually to Mars requires seeking answers to fundamental questions. Since humanity last stepped on the Lunar surface on December 19, 1972, scientists have been wondering how deep space impacts the human body and other life forms, like plants, which will sustain humans for long duration space missions.\n\nFour studies within BioExpt-01 using model organisms and plant seeds aim to help answer critical  questions essential to ensuring crew health on future long-duration missions:\n\nTheDeep Space Radiation Genomicsinvestigation will pioneer scientific discovery by correlating which genes provide cells with a higher probability of survival as well as understanding the types and doses of radiation they experience beyond Earth’s protective magnetosphere.\n\n“We’re using yeast cells in this investigation because they share a lot in common with our own human cells,” explains Luis Zea, principal investigator at the University of Colorado in Boulder, Colorado. “Rather than sending limited numbers of humans in a spacecraft, we can send millions of yeast cells in a tiny bag and study deep-space effects on those cells, which would be very similar to what would occur within our own cells under the same conditions.”\n\nTo prepare for this flight, Zea and his team had to develop a new type of hardware that allows scientists to do their research in space without the presence of human travelers within the spacecraft.\n\n“With Artemis I, we need to have the capability to start the experiment at a specific time during the flight,” said Zea. “So we developed new hardware called PLASM – that’s short for Peristaltic Laboratory for Automated Science with Multigenerations – at BioServe which will be able to detect where it is in relation to Earth and the Moon. It will autonomously start the experiment once it passes through the last Van Allen Belt into a high -radiation environment in order to study how deep space radiation affects the DNA and how the DNA is repaired by these cells.”\n\nIt’s essential to understand the damage deep-space radiation does to DNA and which DNA repair mechanisms are more efficient under these conditions. This knowledge will serve as the baseline for future studies on how researchers can support reliable DNA repair mechanisms for astronauts traveling to deep space.\n\nTraveling to deep space and back requires an ample amount of fuel, oxygen, and nutrition. As it is, available room on board a rocket is hard to come by, so it raises the question: What is portable and can accomplish all three needs?\n\nTheFuel to Marsinvestigation will aim to identify genes and metabolic pathways in the green unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii that appear to have enhanced survival advantages during exposure to the combined effects of space radiation and altered gravity. These could be incorporated into parent strains in future studies to optimize generation of hydrogen and other fuels in space.\n\n“As it turns out, algae is a wonderful source of hydrogen, which is a gas, but can be used as a fuel,” said Holly Birdsall, Fuel to Mars co-principal investigator at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas. “Algae is also edible and can be used to make vitamins or oils that humans need for nutrition. It also couldn’t be simpler to grow — algae requires water and light and that’s just about it. They are a great tiny traveling companion that can answer a lot of our needs.”\n\nThis investigation is led by Birdsall and Timothy Hammond, principal investigator at Duke University School of Medicine in Durham, North Carolina. Together, they hope to gain a deeper understanding of how cells interact with radiation and how to best optimize plants in space.\n\n\"Individual genes in Chlamydomonas have been knocked out helping elucidate the role of important plant genes in the unique environment of deep space,” says Hammond. “Because of this, we can determine which genes determine survival, making green algae the key to studying cells and their reactions in the entire plant world.”\n\nInvestigating Roles of Melanin and DNA Repair on Adaptation and Survivability of Fungi in Deep Spacewill help researchers understand how cells adapt to high levels of cosmic radiation during space travel by focusing on fungi’s natural protective qualities such as DNA repair and melanin synthesis.\n\nZheng Wang, principal investigator at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, DC, hopes this investigation will help researchers identify new ways to prevent radiation damage to humans and equipment in space.\n\n“Fungi are one of the first organisms to thrive in environments on Earth that experience nuclear activity, so there’s a lot of interest in how fungi are able to make life more habitable not only terrestrially but also in deep space,” according to Wang. “Astronauts will have to overcome higher radiation levels during space travel, and one possible solution is to use fungal products to protect them.”\n\nThe different types of fungi that Wang and his team are studying represent different characteristics that help fungi adapt to similar conditions. The first type is a healthy wild-type – which means it’s normally occurring -- strain. The second and third strains are mutants unable to perform DNA repair, which is important to investigate since DNA carries the instructions for how a body should function. The fourth mutant strain cannot produce melanin, which is a pigment occurring in the hair, skin, and iris of the eye in humans and animals which helps block out damaging UV rays.\n\nWang and his team will compare the survival of these strains to understand how important DNA repair and melanin are to thriving in deep space. Their results will help engineer treatments to protect astronauts from high levels of radiation during deep space exploration, and help establish a sustainable presence in space, on the Moon, or on Mars.\n\nLife Beyond Earth: Effect of Spaceflight on Seeds with Improved Nutritional Valueinvestigation will study the impact of space-flight beyond the Van Allen radiation belt on amino acids (the building blocks of proteins) in Arabidopsis thaliana seeds.\n\nAs the main component of skin, muscles, organs, bones, and nails, protein makes up a significant part of the human body and is present in every cell. These proteins are made up of amino acids, which are essential for human diets.\n\nWhen plants and astronauts travel to space, they are subject to several stressors. Plants have been found to lose nutrients, including amino acids, in microgravity. To travel long distances, such as to Mars, plants need to produce more nutrients in a confined space with limited resources.\n\n“Our technology equips plants with a higher content of amino acids that are essential for the human diet,” said Federica Brandizzi, principal investigator for the investigation at the College of Natural Science at Michigan State University, in East Lansing, Michigan. “We’re attempting to see how we can improve plant productivity using plants that we’ve modified to have more resources to withstand spaceflight.”\n\nBrandizzi and her team will send seeds of a model plant called Arabidopsis thaliana, which have been genetically engineered to produce high levels of specific essential amino acids. They will study how deep space affects the levels of amino acids within these genetically modified seeds and see if they confer a competitive advantage for germination and produce stronger plants.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAbout NASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences\n\nNASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences  Division pioneers scientific discovery and enables exploration by using space environments to conduct investigations both on Earth and in Space.

From December 2024 through May 2025, over 300 teams of upper elementary, middle, and high school students from 22 states participated, applying STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) skills in exciting and creative ways.\n\nParticipants tackled eight Mission Objectives inspired by NASA’s Artemis missions, which aim to return humans to the Moon. Students explored challenges such as:\n\nIn-person hub events were hosted by Northern Arizona University, Central Washington University, and Montana State University, where teams from Washington, Montana, and Idaho gathered to present their work, collaborate with peers, and experience life on a college campus. Students also had the chance to connect virtually with NASA scientists and engineers through NESSP’s NASA Expert Talks series.\n\n“Artemis ROADS III is NESSP’s eighth ROADS challenge, and I have to say, I think it’s the best one yet. It’s always inspiring to see so many students across the country engage in a truly meaningful STEM experience. I heard from several students and educators that participating in the challenge completely changed their perspective on science and engineering. I believe that’s because this program is designed to let students experience the joy of discovery and invention—driven by both teamwork and personal creativity—that real scientists and engineers love about their work. We also show students the broad range of STEM expertise NASA relies on to plan and carry out a mission like Artemis. Most importantly, it gives them a chance to feel like they are part of the NASA mission, which can be truly transformative.”– Dr. Darci Snowden, Director, NESSP\n\nNESSP proudly recognizes the following teams for completing all eight Mission Objectives and the Final Challenge:\n\nYou can see highlights of these teams’ work in the Virtual Recognition Ceremony video on theNESSP YouTube channel. The presentation also features the teams selected to travel to Kennedy Space Center in August of 2025, the ultimate prize for these future space explorers!\n\nIn addition to student engagement, the ROADS program provided professional development workshops and NGSS-aligned classroom resources to support K–12 educators. Teachers are invited to explore these materials and register for the next round of workshops, beginning in August 2025:https://nwessp.org/professional-development-registration.\n\nFor more information about NESSP, its programs, partners, and the ROADS National Challenge, visitwww.nwessp.orgor contactinfo@nwessp.org.\n\n-----------\n\nNASA’s Northwest Earth and Space Science Pathways' (NESSP) project is supported by NASA cooperative agreement award number 80NSSC22M0006 and is part of NASA's Science Activation Portfolio.

To address the problem, scientists at the University at Buffalo and Yale University used NASA satellite data to study cloud cover, which they found can help identify the size and location of important animal and plant habitats.\n\nClouds influence such environmental factors as rain, sunlight, surface temperature and leaf wetness—all of which dictate where plants and animals can survive. As part of their study, researchers examined 15 years of data from NASA’s Earth-orbiting Terra and Aqua satellites and built a database containing two images per day of cloud cover for nearly every square kilometer of the planet from 2000 to 2014.\n\nThe study found that variations in cloud cover sharply delineated the boundaries of ecological biomes relevant to many unique species.\n\nThe study was published in the journalPLOS Biologyon March 31.\n\n“When we visualized the data, it was remarkable how clearly you could see many different biomes on Earth based on the frequency and timing of cloudy days over the past 15 years,” said lead scientist Adam Wilson, who conducted the majority of the research at Yale University and is now an assistant professor of geography at the University at Buffalo. “As you cross from one ecosystem into another, those transitions show up very clearly, and the exciting thing is that these data allow you to directly observe those patterns at 1-kilometer resolution.”\n\nCloud cover also helped the researchers better predict where specific species live. By taking cloud patterns into account, the team was able to determine the size and location of habitats for the montane woodcreeper (a South American bird) and king protea (a South African shrub) in unprecedented detail and accuracy. That finding is particularly exciting because the technique could be used to research the habitats of threatened plants and animals, said co-author Walter Jetz, associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Yale University.\n\n“Understanding the spatial patterns of biodiversity is critical if we want to make informed decisions about how to protect species and manage biodiversity and its many functions into the future,” Jetz said.\n\nThe study demonstrates how remote sensing can be a powerful tool in those efforts, Wilson said. “That’s one of the really exciting developments in the field today. We now have decades of satellite observations that we can pull together to characterize the global environment,” he said, noting that Aqua and Aura have been collecting two images per day everywhere on Earth for well over a decade. “It is exciting to now be able to tap into this large stack of detailed data to support global biodiversity and ecosystem monitoring and conservation.”\n\nRead the

That’s the question being addressed by Principal Investigators Anna-Lisa Paul and Robert Ferl in theEpigenetic Adaptation to the Spaceflight Environment – Accumulated Genomic Change Induced by Generations in Space (Plant Habitat-03)investigation which will soon launch to the International Space Station aboard Northrop Grumman’s 18th commercial resupply services mission for NASA.\n\nFrom One Generation to the Next?\n\nThis investigation will take advantage of the unique environment aboard the space station to study an intriguing phenomenon. When exposed to environmental stress, such as spaceflight, plants undergo surprising epigenetic changes. Meaning, instead of changing existing information in the DNA, extra information is added which affects gene expression.\n\nWhat remains unknown and not yet tested is if these changes remain constant from one plant generation to another, like the adaptive changes that occur in Earth-based plant stresses.\n\nWith Plant Habitat-03, seeds from Earth-based plants will be grown-out aboard the space station, harvested on-orbit and returned to Earth. These seeds will then be re-flown together with comparable seeds that were not previously flown in space to see if epigenetics changes from spaceflight affected results in the subsequent generation of plants flown in space.\n\nThis process will give researchers insight into how plants adapt in space from one generation to another.\n\nAdvantages of Adaptative Plants\n\nPlant evolution on Earth can take thousands of years, but research aboard station aims to see if plants could quickly adapt via epigenetic changes from one generation to another in the microgravity environment.\n\nBy understanding the effects of extreme environments on plants, scientists will be able to determine whether a growing generation of plants in space can create subsequent generations of plants with a similar adaptive advantage.\n\n“Plant Habitat-03 will provide a better understanding of how the epigenome contributes to an organism's ability to adapt to environmental stress, in both current and subsequent generations,” according to Sharmila Bhattacharya, space biology program scientist in NASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences Division at NASA Headquarters in Washington. “This is important insight into how astronauts could potentially grow repeated generations of crops in orbit as well as on the Moon or Mars to provide food and other services aboard future space missions. The results can also support development of strategies for adapting crops for growth in extreme environments on Earth.”\n\nThis investigation, among many other research initiatives, will enable scientists to better understand how biological phenomena respond to the extreme conditions of space. This information is critical as NASA prepares for future human exploration, including the agency’s Artemis missions that will send astronauts to the Moon to prepare for future expeditions to Mars.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nPlant Habitat-03-https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/explorer/Investigation.html?#id=8336\n\nhttps://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/ng-18-science-highlights/\n\nAbout BPS\n\nNASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences Divisionpioneers scientific discovery and enables exploration by using space environments to conduct investigations not possible on Earth.

As these changes continue, the long-term survival of many species depends on their ability to safely traverse the landscape to find more optimal habitats.\n\nTo improve animal connectivity and conservation strategies, The Nature Conservancy (TNC) climate change ecologist and NASA-funded principal investigator Kimberly Hall and her team of scientists updated the software tools Omniscape and Circuitscape. This software can input diverse climate, physical, and ecological variables from NASA Earth observation data to map the complex routes animals take to traverse the landscape under current and possible future conditions.\n\nTraditional modeling looks at an organism's single best pathway, but in reality, an animal is likely to choose different avenues based on daily conditions. Omniscape, and its predecessor Circuitscape, leverage circuit theory to map an animal’s changing movements like electricity moving across a circuit board.\n\nThis software package is currently being used by TNC and partner agencies to guide decision-making and investments in land protection and management.\n\nMore information on Omniscape and Circuitscape and how they’re being used can be found

As preserved foods lose their nutritional value over time, produce grown in space may be an excellent source of supplemental nutrients. Growing plants may also provide psychological benefits for astronauts traveling far from home. TheGrowing Beyond Earth Program, a partnership betweenFairchild Tropical Botanic Gardenand theSpace Crop Productionresearch group at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center, has had more than 10,000 middle and high school students contribute to NASA research.  Participating teachers in grades 6-12 receive all the materials to conduct research similar to how plants are being grown in theVeggiechamber on the International Space Station.  Students conduct experiment trials, collect data on different crop types and growing techniques, and report these data in a dedicated online portal.  The compiled data are accessed by Fairchild and NASA scientists, and crops and approaches that work well in classrooms are then tested atKennedy Space Center.\n\nSince the program began in 2015, students have tested approximately 200 plant types in numerous locations across the nation.  The different classroom locations and student scientists involved ensure variability in testing conditions, and if plant varieties do well in many locations, they are likely robust and resilient enough to grow in space.  Twostudent-selected crop varietieshave now been successfully grown in Veggie on the International Space Station, and eaten by the astronauts.  In addition, students have tested a large variety of approaches to growing plants, including variations in lighting, fertilizer, multi-cropping, and pollination.

Adam of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, presented the topic titled “Surface Science in Microgravity – Fluid Geometry in the Ring-Sheared Drop,” presented to a broad audience from academia and the scientific community during the Physical Sciences and Materials Development session.\n\nDr. Adam provided a comprehensive overview of the Ring Sheared Drop (RSD) hardware, experiment campaigns and the evolving role of RSD in advancing biophysical science, particularly in the characterization of proteins. Leveraging the absence of gravity aboard the ISS, the RSD enables researchers to isolate shear-induced aggregation processes relevant to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, offering insight into mechanisms that are difficult to observe with ground-based experiments.\n\nThe presentation traced the RSD development, beginning with the initial campaign in 2016 which was funded by Biological and Physical Sciences (BPS) for hardware development and the first science campaign, and culminating in the most recent 2025 flight campaign, which involved the study of three key proteins: Immunoglobulin G (IgG), Insulin, and Human Serum Albumin (HSA).\n\nA highlight of the session was a discussion of the RSD's custom camera configuration, which has enabled a novel fluid characterization technique known as Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV). This method allows researchers to visually track particle motion within the fluid drop, supporting the validation and refinement of theoretical and computational models describing protein behavior in microgravity.\n\nAdam further explained how in-situ imaging and velocimetry techniques, enabled by the unique RSD camera setup, enhance the analysis of fluid flow and shear-driven aggregation at the molecular level.\n\nThe presentation showcased a series of comparative videos from past and current RSD campaigns, illustrating protein dynamics under varying sample compositions. He emphasized how flight data are being compared against Earth analog experiments to 1) validate predictive models and 2) inform the design of future microgravity research – the two-fold focus of the research from the beginning.\n\nThe session concluded with a summary of preliminary findings from the 2025 campaign, including multi-geometry rheometry results, which offer deeper insight into the viscoelastic behavior of proteins under shear. These findings may well contribute to the development of future pharmaceutical and therapeutic strategies.\n\nTo view the entire presentation, arecordingis available for downloaded from the 2025 ISSRDC site.\n\nVisit the Physical Sciences Informatics (PSI) database to access experiment data from two RSD campaigns,Interfacial Bioprocessing of Pharmaceuticals (IBP-I)andAmyloid Fibril Formation

The Open Science Data Repository Analysis Working Groups invite volunteers from all backgrounds to help answer this question.Request to jointhese citizen science groups to help investigate how life adapts to space environments, exploring topics like radiation effects, microgravity’s impact on human and plant health, and how microbes change in orbit.\n\nCurrently, nine Analysis Working Groups (AWGs) hold monthly meetings to advance their specific focus areas. Participants collaborate using an online platform, the AWG “Forum-Space”, where they connect with peers and experts, join discussions, and contribute toover 20 active projects.\n\nThe AWGs work with data primarily from theNASA Open Science Data Repository(OSDR), a treasure trove of spaceflight data on physiology, molecular biology, bioimaging, and much more. For newcomers, there aretutorialsand acomprehensive papercovering all aspects of the repository and the AWG community. You can explore500+ studies,an omics multi-study visualization portal, theenvironmental data app, andRadLab, a portal for radiation telemetry data. (“Omics” refers to fields of biology that end in “omics,” like “genomics”.)\n\nEach of the nine AWGs has a Lead who organizes their group and holds monthly virtual meetings. Once you join, make sure to connect with the Lead and get on the agenda so you can introduce yourself. Learn moreabout the AWGs here.\n\nHave an idea for a new project? Propose a new project and help lead it! From data analysis and visualization to shaping data standards and conducting literature meta-analyses, there’s a place for everyone to contribute.Request to join, and together, we can address a great challenge for humanity: understanding and enabling life to thrive in deep space!\n\nOn April 17 at 3pm Eastern Time, the NASA Citizen Science Leaders Series is hosting an virtual event with Ryan Scott about these Analysis Working Groups and their work.

Spectrum was developed to undertake these types of studies using model organisms on ISS.\n\nAll organisms exposed to the spaceflight environment exhibit changes in the expression of many genes relative to the comparable ground controls left on Earth. The Multi-Spectral Fluorescence Imaging System (Spectrum) enables scientists to monitor these changes in real time, non-destructively, using live organisms (plants, bacteria, fungi, small invertebrates).\n\nWhile the expression of some genes does not change in the space environment, some are turned on to a greater extent and others to a lesser extent. Understanding why this happens has great implications for both long-duration space missions and achieving a better understanding of the basic mechanisms at work within life on Earth.  For example, some of the genes with altered responses in spaceflight trigger plant defense responses on Earth that are normally activated by pathogens and herbivores.\n\nNASA’s Kennedy Space Center Payload Development team has developed a single-locker-sized instrument (Spectrum) that facilitates the evaluation of these phenomena (and others) in an automated fashion and requires minimal crew time.\n\nSpectrum is a multi-spectral fluorescence imaging system designed for capturingin vivo(i.e., within a living organism) gene expression in the low- to zero-gravity environment of the International Space Station (ISS). To enable the detection of gene expression, DNA segments encoding fluorescent proteins are inserted into the organism’s genome next to the genes of interest, so that when these genes are activated, the fluorescent proteins are produced as well. The detection and monitoring of these fluorescent proteins will allow the scientific community to further understand biological responses of these organisms when subjected to space environments.\n\nSpectrum resides within anEXpedite the PRocessing of Experiments for Space Station(EXPRESS) rack, which provides power, data, and other elements needed to run science experiments on the ISS.\n\nTo hold the biological samples that will be observed, Spectrum accommodates standard 100 mm x 100 mm Petri plates, 128 mm x 82 mm multi-well culture plates, and other custom containers within its growth and imaging chamber. Principal Investigators (PIs) can specify automated management of chamber properties and the collection of chamber environment information, including near real-time 71-megapixel images of fluorescent emission from biological organisms under highly uniform illumination. PIs can control the Spectrum chamber temperature (18-37° C), relative humidity (RH), carbon dioxide concentrations (ranging between 400 ppm up to ISS-ambient levels), and growth light characteristics. Spectrum can also remove volatile organic compounds (including ethylene down to 25 ppb) from the environment. The Spectrum software is completely controlled via ground commanding and PIs can modify the Spectrum conditions during experiments. In a typical experiment, an astronaut loads an experimental plate with the organisms to be studied into the Spectrum unit; the system runs automatically controlling temperature and changing the lights according to a desired program; and the camera takes pictures as programmed (e.g., hourly).\n\nResearchers can image up to five genes at a time using a variety of fluorescent proteins that indicate genes of interest, and excitation light and emission filters that are easily replaceable on-orbit by the crew. Spectrum is also equipped with chlorophyll fluorescence imaging to monitor plant health during experiments.\n\nSpectrum’s filter wheel can hold ten emission filters and rapidly switch between them. The Excitation Light Source (ELS) uses diffusers to achieve an 80% uniform illumination of the plates containing the biological samples. Additional filters are provided to support color and infrared images. This ability to switch between emission filters allows researchers to image several fluorescent proteins in a single specimen.\n\nFour specimen plates can be mounted and rotated for sequential imaging. Chamber air is ducted through the carousel to suppress condensation on the inside of Petri plate covers. The carousel is capable of continuous rotation up to 33 rpm and is removable to allow future modification for partial gravity exposures on-orbit.\n\nTo enable growth of photosynthetic organisms, a top-mounted LED light cap is equipped with broad-spectrum white (400-750 nm), red (630-660 nm), blue (400-500 nm), and green (520-530 nm) LEDs with an intensity range of 0-1000 micromoles.\n\nSpectrum is commanded from the ground and internally collects and stores time-stamped images with the option to downlink images and chamber environmental data for near-real time evaluation by the investigator team. To accommodate new science requirements, PIs may consider modifications to certain Spectrum components including the ELS, the Emission Filters, camera lenses, chamber sensors, carousel assemblies, and the Air Filter Cartridge. Spectrum software can also be modified during flight.\n\nSpectrum is now available for experiments on ISS, creating a new capability for multiple types of investigations that will further NASA’s goals relating to understanding the effects of spaceflight on biological organisms.\n\nDavid Flowers, NASA Kennedy Space Center\n\nBiological and Physical Science Division‘s Space Biology Program\n\nA NASA-sponsored team at the University of Iowa (UI) is restoring and advancing the nation’s…\n\nWebb is the premier observatory of the next decade, serving thousands of astronomers worldwide.

A study published in npj Microgravity shows how analyzing diverse datasets together can reveal insights that might otherwise be missed — in this case, linking space-grown food quality to astronaut nutrition and gut health.\n\nThepaperreviewed previous studies of plants grown aboard the International Space Station. The authors found that some edible plants grown in low Earth orbit have lower concentrations of essential nutrients, like calcium and magnesium, than those grown on Earth.\n\nThe reduced levels of these nutrients could make crops not as effective in mitigating the bone loss and reduced immune function that astronauts encounter in space.\n\nThree Analysis Working Groups from NASA'sOpen Science Data Repositorycollaborated to make this paper possible. These discipline-specific groups typically work independently, but this project sparked conversations among researchers with different specialties.\n\nResearchers combined plant data, crop nutrition profiles, gut studies, and astronaut blood biomarkers — a data integration effort of the Biological and Physical Sciences Divisionopen sciencemodel. The work also draws on data from JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency).\n\nFor NASA, these findings offer new insights into how to feed and support astronauts in space, particularly on long-duration missions to the Moon and Mars.\n\nThe study also examined increased intestinal permeability — often called “leaky gut” — a condition that can result from poor nutrition and may be exacerbated by the space environment. Intestinal permeability may interfere with how astronauts absorb nutrients and regulate immune responses.\n\nIf properly engineered, space-grown crops could offer a solution to these health challenges. The team outlined several potential strategies, including bioengineering plants with higher nutrient content, incorporating more antioxidant-rich species, and designing personalized nutrition plans using astronauts' genetic information.\n\nThe study suggests targeting specific biological pathways, such as using compounds like quercetin, an antioxidant found in certain crops, to address bone health challenges at the molecular level. The approach emphasizes designing nutrition plans based on individual astronaut physiology, including how well their digestive systems can absorb nutrients.\n\nOpen Science Data Repository\n\nOpen Science Data Repository Analysis Working Groups (AWG)\n\nNASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences Divisionpioneers scientific discovery and enables exploration by using space environments to

Both, however, share a common goal: bettering life on Earth by defying gravity and conducting research in space.\n\nPeople around the world use P&G’s products every day—they own multiple brands providing skincare, haircare, personal health care, laundry products, and more. Many of these products are comprised of colloids—mixtures of microscopic particles suspended within other substances, such as gels or a liquid medium. They’re behind the science of what makes dishwashing liquid clean better or a lotion hydrate skin longer. Over time, however, these colloids break down or separate, rendering products unusable.\n\n“We wanted to take gravity out of the equation,” says Dr. Matthew Lynch, principal scientist with P&G. “By experimenting with colloids in space, we would be able to better understand the structure of these substances—how they react to heat, how they react to cold, how they change over time—without gravity as a contributing factor. This information can then be used to help us design stronger, better, and longer-lasting products in the future.”\n\nWhile attending a NASA conference, Lynch met with internationally renowned microgravity experts with the division which would eventually become NASA’s Division of Space Life and Physical Sciences Research and Applications (SLPSRA). The group immediately saw a connection between P&G’s needs and NASA’s interest in using the unique orbiting laboratory to advance the understanding of fundamental science. “The stabilization of dispersed actives against sedimentation in consumer products is an important technical challenge,” says Dr. William Meyer, senior scientist with NASA’s Glenn Research Center. “So, when P&G approached us about this research, we were happy to work with their scientists to help them find a solution.”\n\nIn accordance with the National Aeronautics and Space Act (theSpace Act), P&G agreed to fund the research needs of the company’s scientists while NASA provided researchers access to its experts, facilities, and resources. Thus, SLPSRA’S support of P&G’s Advanced Colloids Experiments (ACE) spanned “cradle to grave”—from designing the experiments for space flight to developing hardware and software specifications for engineers; and from designing test plans to analyzing the data. Helmed by Ron Sicker, project manager at Glenn, teams of specialists converged to bring the project to fruition. “The NASA team worked with Lynch and his colleagues every step of the way, ensuring that they optimized their time in space by helping them thoroughly prepare beforehand on the ground,” says Sicker.\n\nThat included zero-gravity test-runs that were conducted on parabolic flights (“vomit comets”). These flights are part of SLPSRA’s “stepping-stones approach”—a progression of various test platforms designed to prepare scientists to optimize their time aboard the International Space Station (ISS). “We had to continually refine what we needed to bring onto the space station to be able to get the most out of our experiments with as few materials possible,” continues Lynch.\n\nCritical to the success of the research was the use of a confocal microscope which enabled the researchers to create the first 3D images of colloids. Much like a medical CT scanner, the microscope captures “sliced images” of the colloids which are then reassembled as a composite 3D image. These images, coupled with the effects of suspending the particles in space—akin to a sci-fi action film where moving objects are suspended in mid-flight—enabled Lynch and his colleagues to examine the colloids from every angle, leading to several key scientific discoveries.\n\nBacked by NASA’s extensive team of scientists, engineers, machinists, and program managers, Lynch and his colleagues were able to test a wide range of variables, from temperature to stirring speeds, to particle sizes, and more. Momentum from the SLPSRA team enabled a smooth transition of the research to the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space (CASIS) which manages the International Space Station’s U.S. National Laboratory. “It was a true collaborative effort between SLPSRA and CASIS,” says Dr. Francis Chiaramonte, program scientist for Physical Sciences with NASA. “The SLPSRA team supported the first two experiments, CASIS fielded the next two, and the most recent two have been joint efforts. The success of the program is a testimony to the partnership approach between our organizations.”\n\nTen years, six rounds of experiments aboard ISS, and many other ground-based experiments later, product innovations resulting from the research are poised to become part of everyday life. As a direct result of conducting its research in space, P&G has received approval on three patent applications and plans to launch new products—only identified as “sprayable freshening products” at press time—in the near-term. For the company, the benefits of the research are promising: lowered production costs, extended shelf lives, and enhanced product quality. For consumers around the world, it could contribute to a better quality of life.\n\nWatch this video to hear directly from Lynch and NASA scientists:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV8cSg8c_Vk\n\nRead an article for additional details on the P&G ACE experiments:https://upward.issnationallab.org/the-iss-household-products/\n\nStay informed on other exciting SLPSRA research initiatives:https://science.nasa.gov/biological-physical\n\nFor daily updates, follow @ISS_Research,Space Station Research and Technology Newsorour Facebook.Follow theISS National Labfor information on its sponsored investigations.

As part of the SEES Microgravity Research initiative, four interns were selected to fly with their experiments in microgravity aboard the ZERO-G parabolic aircraft. The students had 11 minutes of weightlessness over 30 parabolas in which to conduct their experiments.\n\nThis immersive experience was made possible through a collaboration between SEES, Space for Teachers, the Wisconsin Space Grant Consortium, and the International Space Station National Laboratory (CASIS). Together, these partners provide students with access to industry-aligned training and direct experience in aerospace experiment design, testing, and integration.\n\nCongratulations to the 2025 SEES Microgravity Research Team:\n\nSelected from nearly 100 proposals submitted by 2024 SEES interns, these four students spent months preparing for flight through weekly technical mentorship and structured milestones. Their training included proposal development, design reviews, safety assessments, hardware testing, and a full payload integration process, working through engineering protocols aligned with industry and mission standards.\n\nIn addition to their individual experiments, the students also supported the flight of 12 team-designed experiments integrated into the ZQube platform, a compact research carrier co-developed by Twiggs Space Lab, Space for Teachers, and NASA SEES. The ZQube enables over 150 SEES interns from across the country to contribute to microgravity investigations. Each autonomous experiment includes onboard sensors, cameras, and transparent test chambers, returning valuable video and sensor data for post-flight analysis.\n\nThis microgravity research opportunity supports the broader SEES mission to prepare students for careers in aerospace, spaceflight engineering, and scientific research. Through direct engagement with NASA scientists, academic mentors, and commercial aerospace experts, students gain real-world insight into systems engineering and the technical disciplines needed in today’s space industry.\n\nThe SEES summer intern program is a nationally competitive STEM experience for 10th-11th grade high school students. Interns learn how to interpret NASA satellite data while working with scientists and engineers in their chosen area of work, including astronomy, remote sensing, and space geodetic techniques to help understand Earth systems, natural hazards, and climate.

This mission will last 10 days, during which the Orion Spacecraft will make two orbits around Earth before transiting to lunar orbit and then returning to Earth. The model organisms that make this journey will be exposed to multiple stressors encountered during deep space exploration, including microgravity and cosmic radiation.  Understanding their physiological responses to these stressors will be critical in helping scientists understand the measures that are needed to enable complex organisms to thrive in deep space.\n\nOne selected study will be executed as a flight experiment and will work to characterize the impact that deep space stressors have on multiple generations ofDrosophila. This investigation will determine how the stressors affect this organism at the cellular level, as well as characterize how cellular changes impact overall health by studying a collection of organ systems such as the brain, heart, and muscle. While it is the program’s intention that this selected project will fly as a payload on the Orion Space Capsule, NASA is still in the process of making an official determination of what science experiments can be accommodated on the Artemis II mission for the Space Biology Program. In the event that this study cannot be flown on the Orion Spacecraft, it will instead be manifested to fly on the International Space Station.\n\nThe other selected study will be executed as a ground study to develop the capability to culture and fixC. elegansin an automated fashion for a future flight study beyond LEO. The study will also characterize how ionizing radiation like the types encountered during deep space exploration impact the molecular and cellular biology of this organism, while also exploring ways to mitigate the adverse effects resulting from radiation exposure.\n\nTwo investigator teams will conduct these Space Biology investigations in two states. When fully implemented, about $1.5 million will be awarded in fiscal years 2024-2027.\n\nJanani Iyer, Ph.D.Universities Space Research Association; Washington DC.Neurological, cardiac, and muscular consequences of the deep space environment in Drosophila melanogaster\n\nTimothy Hammond, Ph.D.Institute For Medical Research, Inc.; Durham, North Carolina.Protection from cosmic radiation.", "ocr_text": "", "media_assets": ["https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/NASA_logo.png?w=300", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/jsc2023e006587.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/esd/articles/2025/A90%20NASA%20Chesapeake%20Shawn%20Serbin.jpeg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/psd/solar-system/skywatching/2025/october/02_Jupiter%20and%20Saturn_Credit_Preston%20Dyches_CC%20BY-NC%202.0.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/gsfc-20171208-archive-e000760orig-stpatricksaurora-iotd.jpg?w=1024", "https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/AFRC2025-0013-02/AFRC2025-0013-02~large.jpg?w=1919&h=1536&fit=clip&crop=faces%2Cfocalpoint", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/uc-s03-working-file-horizontal-v02-2.png?w=1024", "https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/ARC-1969-A-16712/ARC-1969-A-16712~large.jpg?w=1920&h=1382&fit=clip&crop=faces%2Cfocalpoint", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/astro/exo-explore/exoplanet-artists-concepts/WISPIT%202%20b%20Wide%20Final.png?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/afrc2025-0030-83.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/1-pia26662-dsc4667-enhanced-nr.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/cds/general/images/2023/09/exoplanetwatch-896.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/missions/hubble/galaxies/spiral/Hubble_NGC2775_potw2538a.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/img-3738.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/esd/articles/2025/hydroflame_banner.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/20240131-207a0543.png?w=1024", "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/themes/nasa-child/assets/images/nasa-logo@2x.png", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/iss070e001252.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/acd25-132-006.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/taking-in-the-view-surface-from-hls.png?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/esd/eo/content-feature/aerosols/images/aerosol_fine_fraction_depth_201008_hammer.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/content/dam/science/astro/programs/physics-of-the-cosmos/images/gwsig/gravitational_waves-16.gif", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/psd/photojournal/pia/pia13/pia13126/PIA13126.tif?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/cds/general/images/2023/03/53636962950-44cdcf9882-o.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/astro/programs/exep/images/exo.png?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/missions/webb/science/2025/09/STScI-01K6196E18EPYF8RDEAQVA01Y3.png?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/cds/learn/science-activation-stories/2025/2025-0805-RiversofStarsandStories-30-moonactivity-sm-Brandi_Stewart.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/missions/prism/prism-data-cube.png?w=1024"], "referenced_urls": [], "provenance": {"parser_path": "external.news", "fetched_at": "2025-10-04T03:41:59.805394", "source_type": "html"}}, "grounded_entities": [{"text": "microgravity", "entity_type": "exposure", "id": "CUSTOM:EXPOSURE:MICROGRAVITY", "label": "microgravity", "source_obo": "CUSTOM", "confidence": 1.0, "spans": [[1307, 1319]]}, {"text": "radiation", "entity_type": "exposure", "id": "CUSTOM:EXPOSURE:RADIATION", "label": "radiation", "source_obo": "CUSTOM", "confidence": 1.0, "spans": [[1331, 1340]]}, {"text": "International Space Station", "entity_type": "platform", "id": "CUSTOM:PLATFORM:ISS", "label": "ISS", "source_obo": "CUSTOM", "confidence": 1.0, "spans": [[2348, 2375]]}, {"text": "physiological", "entity_type": "assay", "id": "CUSTOM:ASSAY:PHYSIOLOGY", "label": "physiology", "source_obo": "CUSTOM", "confidence": 1.0, "spans": [[1363, 1376]]}, {"text": "days", "entity_type": "duration", "id": "CUSTOM:DURATION:ACUTE", "label": "acute", "source_obo": "CUSTOM", "confidence": 1.0, "spans": [[1037, 1041]]}, {"text": "years", "entity_type": "duration", "id": "CUSTOM:DURATION:LONG_DURATION", "label": "long duration", "source_obo": "CUSTOM", "confidence": 1.0, "spans": [[2976, 2981]]}], "referenced_ids": {"pmcid": [], "doi": [], "osdr_id": [], "taskbook_id": []}}

These proposals are in the research areas of biophysics, combustion science, fluid physics, and materials science. The five investigators will use data contained in the NASA’sPhysical Sciences Informatics(PSI) system and build on prior reduced-gravity research to advance fundamental and applied research in the physical sciences. The PSI system contains data from completed physical science reduced-gravity flight experiments conducted on theInternational Space Station, Space Shuttle flights, free flying spacecraft, commercial cargo flights to and from the space station, or from related ground-based studies which have used this flight data. This program element is part of Science Mission Directorate (SMD) Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences - 2023 (ROSES-2023) solicitation.\n\nThe selected proposal in Materials Science has the goal to enhance our understanding of cement hydration and microstructure in a microgravity environment. The proposed work would leverage the Microgravity Investigation of Cement Solidification (MICS) data and use Machine Learning-assisted reconstruction codes to study the effectiveness of nanoseed addition to hydrated cements, as well as characterize its 3D microstructures. Deliverables from this project can be used for other relevant applications, including cement-like materials from lunar or Mars regolith. This project is led by Prof. Namiko Yamamoto (Pennsylvania State University).\n\nAnother selected proposal will analyze experimental data from the Advanced Combustion via Microgravity Experiments (ACME) s-Flame investigation. The objective is to characterize and gain predictive capability of the structure and dynamics of diffusion flames in well-defined flow fields. Since many combustion engines and devices use diffusion flames, understanding the underlying dynamics and chemistry will improve performance in terms of power, efficiency, pollutant emissions and reliability. This project is led by Prof. Stephen Tse (Rutgers University).\n\nThe Physical Sciences Research Program is managed by theBiological and Physical Sciences Divisionin NASA's Science Mission Directorate. This program conducts fundamental and applied physical sciences research, with the objective of pioneering scientific discovery, enabling space exploration, and providing benefits on Earth. The fundamental research explores the laws of the universe and physical phenomena in the absence of gravity. Applied research investigates the underlying physical sciences mechanisms and phenomena to enable space technologies to function in reduced gravity as we return to the Moon and our journey to Mars. Both have led to improved space systems or new products on Earth.\n\nThe selected proposals are from five institutions in five states, with the total combined award amount of approximately $1.3 M during a two-year period. Below is the complete list of the selected proposals, principal investigators, and their organizations:\n\nCuriosity and the desire to explore are traits deeply rooted in human nature.

These efforts will focus on determining the effects of multiple deep-space stressors (e.g., radiation & reduced gravity) on multiple organisms. This work will support animal research (vertebrate and invertebrate) that will enable us to better understand human responses to the deep-space environment. The plant research will support human exploration either through the eventual production of micronutrients and food during deep-space missions, or the establishment of bioregenerative life support systems. The goal of the TIDES initiative is to enable long-duration missions and improve life on Earth through innovative research.\n\nThe awarded proposals include both ground-based and International Space Station studies and will use different model systems to understand how the multiple variables of the spaceflight environment impact plant and animal biology/physiology and the relationships of some of these models with their respective microbial ecosystems. Selected studies include (but are not limited to) efforts to 1) understand plant/pathogen interactions in spaceflight, 2) identify optimal conditions for growing plants in hostile environments including those involving low pressure and altered gravity or radiation, 3) understand how the spaceflight environment effects animal muscle physiology and energy metabolism, and 4) provide insights into how space travel impacts an animal host and its microbiome, both individually and together.\n\nTen investigators will conduct these space biology investigations from eight institutions in seven states. Five of these awards are to investigators new to the Space Biology Program.

Yet the last five items to be loaded will weigh less than an ounce. These include two plant and two animal species along with a microbial study. Scientists will examine these to better understand how to prepare future astronauts for the rigors of long-distance space travel, as well as unlock a few secrets that may benefit all of humankind back on Earth.\n\nBriefly, the two animal experiments and the microbial study consist of:\n\nAn investigation that examines how microbes behave in a low gravity environment and whether this affects their ability to cause disease and changes their resistance to antibiotics.\n\nAnimals and microbes have always formed symbiotic relationships, where each one helps the other. Gravity’s role in shaping these simple interactions is not well understood, however, and the microgravity on the space station will give scientists the opportunity to improve their understanding, in this case by studying the bond between a tiny bobtail squid, Euprymna scolopes, and a bacterial buddy that makes it glow in the dark, Vibrio fischeri.\n\nIf you thought the cockroach was the planet’s hardiest survivor, think again. The tardigrade, or water bear, is the gold standard used for studying survival in extreme environments on Earth – and in space. How are they able to do so? That’s what scientists will investigate as they try to identify the genes this microscopic animal uses to adapt to harsh environments.\n\nThe two plant-based experiments include:\n\nGenes are again of interest to biologists as they examine how changes in gravity affect a plant’s RNA regulation of gene expression in both the plant’s roots and shoots.\n\nUsing thale cress to test their hypothesis, investigators will test specific elements inside the plant cells to determine which are used to help the plant sense gravity and how these intracellular components respond to gravity.\n\nDr. Sharmila Bhattacharya is the program scientist for Space Biology in NASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences Division. She becomes excited when she explains the potential benefits of these experiments not only to the future of space travel, but to people on Earth.\n\n“Starting with the microbial experiment: First, you have astronauts spending weeks on board the space station and they’ll bring with them a number of bacteria in their bodies. There are usually microbes present everywhere in most environments on Earth and aboard spacecraft in space. Most of these microbes are benign, but some have the potential to be harmful. So, we want to learn how to treat the crew members if they become ill, and in order to do that, we need to understand how these bacteria perform under microgravity conditions. For instance, could the space environment increase or decrease their resistance to antibiotics?\n\nSimilarly, we want to understand how organisms that are symbiotic with humans react to a lack of gravity. How will that change the dynamic we normally see on Earth?”\n\nThe water bears, too, capture Dr. Bhattacharya’s imagination.\n\n“They exemplify a ‘survival of the fittest’ species. You can expose them to sub-freezing or extremely hot temperatures, and they survive. You can dehydrate them or expose them to high doses of radiation, and they survive. How is this possible? By studying how their genes act in a weightless environment, these bears may offer us some biological clues regarding their resilience, and this research, in turn, may help find ways for other biological organisms to withstand extreme conditions on Earth and in space.\n\nWith the two plant experiments, we’re striving to learn what building blocks they use to adapt to a different and more stressful environment. This could potentially lead not only to more robust growth of edible plants for our astronauts, but also help us develop strains of plants that can withstand stressful climate changes here on Earth.”\n\nIn the end, the many benefits to people on Earth from these five biological experiments will begin beyond the planet itself.\n\nThese investigations are supported by NASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences (BPS) Division as part of its mission to pioneer scientific discovery and enable exploration.

Studying biological and physical phenomena under extreme conditions allows researchers to advance the fundamental scientific knowledge required to go farther and stay longer in space, while also benefitting life on Earth. Not only can these experiments provide pioneering scientific discovery – they enable sustainable deep space exploration and support transformative engineering.\n\nThe commercial resupply launch took place Thursday, March 21, at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida.\n\nThe emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria poses a significant threat to human health, both on Earth and in space. Common, harmless bacteria likeEnterococcus faecalis(EF) andEnterococcus faecium, can be found on the International Space Station just as they are on Earth -- and yet, they exhibit resistance to antibiotics and are hardier than their counterparts down on the ground. This raises concerns about potential more harmful bacteria causing infections for astronauts, especially during long-duration missions, as standard antibiotic treatments might prove ineffective.\n\nTo address this issue, Genomic Enumeration of Antibiotic Resistance in Space will survey the space station for antibiotic-resistant microbes. By analyzing the genetic makeup of these bacteria, scientists hope to understand how they adapt to the unique environment of space. This knowledge will be instrumental in developing protective measures for astronauts’ health on future long-duration missions. Additionally, it could contribute to a broader understanding of antibiotic resistance, benefiting healthcare practices on Earth.\n\nA temporary replacement module for the Cold Atom Lab will be aboard SpaceX-30.

During steel making processes, such as continuous casting, the impurity in the cast steel is influenced by the interplay between the molten steel and molten slags.  Understanding the interfacial phenomena could help produce higher purity steels. Success could increase the space station's commercial utilization and improve oxide melt manufacturing and application on Earth.\n\nDuring the initial checkouts following launch of the Condensation Module Power Filter  hardware onNG-19 in August 2023, an anomaly was observed in the test section thermocouple readings. The team investigated the issue and recommended replacement of the power filter module to fix the anomalous thermocouple readings. The PFM filters out undesirable electromagnetic emissions noise for the payload electronics.\n\nNASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences Divisionpioneers’ scientific discovery and enables exploration by using space environments to conduct investigations not possible on Earth.

While all four of these transportation innovations rely on fuel for power, another key component is thermal management. Without controlling the distribution and flow of heat inside a system, such as the International Space Station and other commercial spacecraft, temperatures inside the vessels would not be habitable for astronauts given the extreme hot and cold temperatures of outer space. This complex issue is just one of the many challenges being investigated by NASA’s Physical Sciences researchers at Glenn Research Center through the Flow Boiling and Condensation Experiment (FBCE).\n\nTwo-Phase Flow Innovation\n\nFindings from FBCE’s Condensation Module for Heat Transfer (CM-HT) are expected to play a vital role in the design of future space and Earth systems. This includes space power generation, planetary habitat, space vehicle temperature control, cryogenic fluids storage, waste management, electric vehicle charging, fighter aircraft cooling under varying g-loads, and regenerative fuel cells.\n\nThe scientific objectives of CM-HT aim to generate a database in flow condensation which will be used for assessing the condensation heat transfer in microgravity as well as developing criteria for flow condensation gravity independence.  Such criteria will be used for designing efficient flow condensers for space applications.  Flow condensation mathematical predictive models, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models, and design correlations will be developed for design applications.\n\nAchieving Equilibrium in Microgravity\n\nThe FBCE will serve as a primary platform for obtaining two-phase flow boiling and condensation heat transfer data in microgravity. The CM-HT test module will feature a thin-walled stainless-steel tube concentrically positioned along another cylindrical channel formed into a highly thermal insulative material.\n\nThe test fluid vapor will flow through the inner tube and condense by rejecting heat to a counterflow of water through the annulus.  Low thermal conductivity of the outer channel wall will ensure that all the heat is transferred between the two fluids. Because of its low thermal conductivity compared to other metals, stainless steel minimizes axial conduction effects, allowing mostly radial heat transfer between the fluids.\n\nBy comparing the microgravity heat transfer data against data obtained in Earth’s gravity, it will be possible to ascertain the influence of body forces on two-phase transport phenomena in pursuit of mechanistic models as well as correlations, and to help determine the minimum flow criteria to ensure gravity independent flow boiling and condensation.\n\nLow velocity two-phase flow in microgravity poses serious challenges not commonly encountered in Earth’s gravity.  As the gravity level is reduced, a new balance comes into play between inertial, surface tension and body forces, so that the basic mechanics of the flow interfacial structure drastically change.  To study these effects, the FBCE facility was installed on the ISS Fluid Integrated Rack (FIR) orbiting laboratory that offers a great microgravity environment for two phase flow research.\n\nImproved Power Efficiency and Energy Conservation\n\nFlow boiling and condensation have been identified as two key mechanisms for heat transport that are vital for achieving weight and volume reduction, as well as performance enhancement in future space systems. Results from this investigation will ultimately support optimization of the design of flow boilers and flow condensers for utilization in long duration missions with high power demand in the microgravity environment.  Efficient boilers and condensers result in efficient use of energy on long duration missions.   Since space systems operate on a limited power budget, placing stringent constraints on the power available will additionally benefit missions’ energy conservation.\n\nThese space-based studies will also advance heat transfer mechanisms on Earth by optimizing heat exchanger performance. Improved electric vehicle charging times, rocket engine cooling, and fighter jet propulsion systems are all just a few of the mechanical systems on Earth that will also benefit from this space technology.\n\nTeam\n\nPrincipal Investigator\n\nProfessor Issam Mudawar, Ph.D.Purdue University, West Lafayette, IndianaUnited States\n\nCo-Investigators/Collaborators\n\nMohammad M.

Biological and physical investigations aboard the spacecraft included experiments studying the impacts of microgravity on plants (grass), how packed bed reactors could improve water purification both in space and on Earth, and observations on new rounds of samples that will allow scientists to learn more about the characteristics of different materials as they change phases on the tiniest scales.\n\nThe cultivation of plants is crucial for developing bio-regenerative life support systems in space. However, growing them in microgravity affects photosynthesis, the process by which plants generate oxygen and convert carbon dioxide into food for astronauts.The C4 Photosynthesis in Space Advanced Plant Experiment-09investigation will study how two grasses (Brachypodium distachyonandSetaria viridis), with different approaches to photosynthesis, respond to microgravity and high carbon dioxide levels during the spaceflight. The insights gained from this research will pave the way for more effective integration of plants on Earth and in future space habitats. This experiment was originally scheduled to be aboardNASA’s SpaceX 30th cargo resupply missionbut was moved to the NG-21 launch.\n\nThePacked Bed Reactor Experiment – Water Recovery Seriesaboard NG-21 will be operated on the space station and will study the hydrodynamics (pressure drop, flow regimes, and flow instability) of two-phase flow (nitrogen gas-water mixture) in microgravity in various types of filters and openings. These samples are important for fluid systems used in life support and water purification and recovery processes. Outcomes of this research will be used to develop design tools and correlations for pressure drop prediction across the various prototypes used in lunar and Martian missions and beyond.\n\nTheElectrostatic Levitation Furnace–4 experiment led by JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency), one of NASA’s space station international partners, includes 20 new test samples. Its goal is to continue establishing guidelines for measuring different thermophysical properties of various samples at temperatures greater than 2,000 degrees Celsius.\n\nTransforming raw materials from a liquid to solid form requires the use of a container, known as a crucible, which is used to both heat and hold the substance as it cools down and hardens. During this process, a chemical reaction occurs between the substance and the crucible, and impurities are released and absorbed in the plasma. The Electrostatic Levitation Furnace is the hardware that allows scientists to remove this contaminating part of the process by creating space between the liquid and container — levitating the sample while heated.\n\nTheElectromagnetic Levitator, an ESA (European Space Agency) levitation facility, which is celebrating a decade aboard the International Space Station, enables scientists to conduct materials research on at least two elements, known as alloys, in a microgravity environment. By studying the core of the physics taking place, researchers can perform experiments to better understand the steps leading up to solidifying and changing phases. This knowledge could contribute to advancements in the manufacturing industry by providing scientists with more information to develop the latest and more reliable materials for activities like 3D printing.\n\nNASA’s 21st Northrop Grumman Mission Launches Scientific Studies to Station\n\nESA - Electromagnetic Levitator turns ten\n\nNASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences Divisionpioneers scientific discovery and enables exploration by using space environments to conduct investigations not possible on Earth. Studying biological and physical phenomenon under extreme conditions allows researchers to advance the fundamental scientific knowledge required to go farther and stay longer in space, while also benefitting life on Earth.\n\nCuriosity and the desire to explore are traits deeply rooted in human nature.

Linked to the importance of microbes maintaining the health of astronauts in space, theAlteration of Bacillus Subtilis DNA Architecture in Space: Global Effects on DNA Supercoiling, Methylation, and the Transcriptome(BRIC-26) investigation will study the response of microbial cells to the spaceflight environment.\n\nBacillus subtilis (B. substilis), a common probiotic gut bacterium, is often used in food products to help prevent foodborne disease. This bacterium is also used in treating gastrointestinal disorders, skin health, and joint lubrication. It has already proven to withstand extreme environmental conditions both on Earth and in space primarily due to its ability to produce a tough, protective structure called an endospore.\n\nBRIC-26 will evaluate changes in the DNA structure of B. substilis after growth in space. This research will provide greater understanding of how the spaceflight environment affects cellular outcomes, which would in turn, influence the health of those aboard a spacecraft as well as their ecosystem. The results of this investigation will pioneer discovery in the field of microbiology and support the ability for the crew to thrive in deep space.\n\nA healthy, nutritious diet is essential for long-duration exploration missions. ThePick-and-Eat Salad-Crop Productivity, Nutritional Value, and Acceptability to Supplement the International Space Station Food System(VEG-05) investigation is the next step in efforts to address the need for a continuous fresh-food production system for working astronauts in space.\n\nAstronauts’ diets consist mostly of pre-packaged foods which is frequently replenished by periodic resupply missions. Pre-packaged foods, however, will degrade during multi-year missions to Mars and beyond, and astronauts will not have easy access to replenish supplies. As humans go farther and stay longer in space, crews will need sustainable sources of food.\n\nThe Vegetable Production System (Veggie) currently supports tests aboard the space station to meet this need. To date, this space garden has successfully grown leafy greens in spaceflight. The research of VEG-05, which is jointly funded by NASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences Division and the Human Research Program, will expand crop variety to include dwarf tomatoes. This investigation will focus on the impact of light quality and fertilizer on fruit production, microbial food safety, nutritional value, behavioral health benefits, and a crew taste test.\n\nDeveloping innovative materials is essential to expanding and creating future Earth-based and space technologies. TheFabrication of Amorphous Metallic glass In Space(FAMIS) investigation aims to do just that by studying the microstructure of composites of bulk metallic glass (BMG) and tungsten spheres processed in microgravity.\n\nBMGs, also known as amorphous metals, are already known to have excellent mechanical properties such as wear resistance. Tungsten, the strongest naturally occurring metal on Earth, is exceptionally durable and is stronger than titanium and steel. Forming composites with BMGs and tungsten could create a new class of high-performance alloys and coatings which could ultimately increase the life of spacecrafts and improve wear resistance in harsh environments, like the Moon.\n\nFor FAMIS, researchers will also look at new methods for making tungsten-heavy alloys for use in planetary exploration vehicles. However, due to the extensive density difference between the two, combining them is challenging in Earth’s gravity, making the microgravity environment aboard the space station an ideal setting for this research.\n\nNASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences Divisionpioneers scientific discovery and enables exploration by using space environments to conduct investigations not possible on Earth. Studying biological and physical phenomenon under extreme conditions allows researchers to advance the fundamental scientific knowledge required to go farther and stay longer in space, while also benefitting life on Earth.\n\nWebb is the premier observatory of the next decade, serving thousands of astronomers worldwide.

Today, these chips only‘live' for approximately one month, limiting researchers’ability to track the longer-term effects of treatments on tissues. For example, an individual’s initial response to a drug might be favorable, but further study could reveal other unexpected or detrimental effects with prolonged usage.\n\nLonger-lived tissue chips could benefit biomedical research in many ways: from reducing the reliance on human and animal testing to predicting drug failures to personalizing medical kits for astronauts in space. To help make this a reality, multiple agencies came together to collectively use their resources to improve our understanding of Earth-based disease and the biological impacts of spaceflight.\n\nRear Admiral Denise Hinton\n\nFDA CHIEF SCIENTIST\n\nDr. Joni Rutter\n\nActing Director, National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NIH/NCATS)\n\nMicrophysiological systems (MPS) and 3D tissue chips replicate organ-specific cells—such as heart, pancreatic, liver, and others—on small devices, roughly the size of a USB drive. Researchers and clinicians use these tissue chips to test and observe how cells respond to various environmental factors (such as radiation and microgravity) and treatments (including medications and chemotherapy).\n\nA collaboration among NASA, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response’s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) aims to extend the longevity of 3D tissue chips and MPSs to a minimum of six months.\n\nThe extended chip lifespan would enable researchers to assess the effects of acute and chronic stressors over longer periods of time. Results from longer-duration studies could be used to better understand: 1) disease models, 2) drug development, 3) clinical trial design, 4) chemical and environmental exposures and countermeasures, and 5) physiological changes due to the spaceflight environment.\n\nSpearheaded by NASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences Division, the agencies have come together to further this important area of research that will benefit human health, both on Earth and in space. The International Space Station’s National Laboratory (also known as CASIS) frequently works with commercial industry, academia, and international organizations to conduct investigations aboard the space station in this and many other areas of research as well.\n\nPartnering has allowed the agencies to maximize the government’s investment in this technology area, reduce duplicative research, and accelerate technical advances toward understanding diseases and ways to treat them.\n\n“Interagency collaboration has enabled the FDA to work more efficiently by leveraging resources, expertise, and approaches through new and established partnerships to address important regulatory science gaps,” says Captain Tracy MacGill, director of Medical Countermeasures (MCM) Regulatory Science with the FDA. Adds Dr. Shannon Loelius, biologist with BARDA,“We can leverage subject matter expertise across United States’government agencies, coordinate efforts across all program awards, and maintain situational awareness of partner interests and development. The collaboration will enable streamlined development with minimal redundancies.”\n\nRepresentatives from the agencies offered their perspectives about how extending the longevity of tissue chips might contribute to scientific advancements in their organizations:\n\n“We expect that extending the lifespan of the microphysiological systems will provide more relevant and predictive models. For example, this will enable us to look at the effects of drugs or other FDA-regulated products over a longer duration in both normal cells and those with acute and chronic diseases. The research has the potential to provide a wider window into safety and efficacy of a variety of medical products.”\n\n“BARDA anticipates that the development of extended longevity microphysiological systems with integrated, non-invasive sampling will enable quicker development of medical countermeasures against chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats, as well as pandemic influenza and emerging infectious diseases, and identification of relevant biomarkers. The MPS could, in theory, be used to screen medical countermeasures to treat specific pathologies associated with acute radiation syndrome, such as endothelial dysfunction. Extended longevity MPS could be used to understand delayed effects of ARS on human systems, as well as any longer-term effects of therapeutics.”\n\n“NIH and NASA are together exploring how cutting-edge biomedical research can benefit human health here on Earth as well as address some of the challenges of deep-space exploration. Extending culture life of tissue chips enables the ability to look at chronic issues over time and anticipate the key challenges of longer-term exposure. It has the potential to transform patient care where clinicians can predict an individual’s response to treatments and develop a personalized approach to medicine. Our objective is to increase focus on automation to enable development of systems that can run without the need for specialized expertise and broaden the utility of using tissue chips to a wider application in a variety of experimental settings and environments.”\n\n“In keeping with the 2017 Memorandum of Understanding between NASA and the NIH, the NIAID Radiation and Nuclear Countermeasures Program is eager to coordinate research activities with the NASA Biological and Physical Sciences Division on studies using long-term 3D tissue and microphysiological systems to better understand the impact of radiation exposures (both terrestrial and space-based) on human tissues. Through this joint funding opportunity, we are excited to explore adaptation of this technology for identification of biomarkers and development of treatments for acute, unintended radiation exposures. This initiative will undoubtedly conserve animal resources and bridge gaps in knowledge of human radiation responses that are not readily addressed through existing models.”\n\n“NIH supports tissue chips research to address the limitations of traditional cellculture and animal models that fail to adequately replicate human tissue physiology, structure, and function. NCI enthusiastically partnered with NASA in this effort to enhance tissue chips longevity so these model systems could better address basic research questions in cancer biology and produce more clinically relevant results for improved cancer screening, diagnosis, drug development, and treatment.”\n\n“Extending the longevity of 3D tissues and microphysiological systems will allow us to understand the effects of spaceflight on human organs and systems, which is critical as we plan for sustainable presence on the lunar surface and our journey to Mars. Given the limited space aboard spaceflight vehicles, crew will need to be selective about the supplies they bring. Knowing ahead of time how an astronaut will respond to a medication ensures that the right supplies are included in a medical kit and minimizes the risks of unexpected adverse effects.”\n\nExtending the longevity of microphysiological systems could lead to transformative advancements in science and medicine, both on Earth and in space. Modeling human tissues on chips and studying them for longer durations could enable researchers to:\n\nProposals for the solicitation to extend the life of tissue chips were accepted through September 2021.

This is probably one of the first questions that comes to mind whenever your family gets ready to embark on a road trip. If the trip is long, you will need to visit gas stations along your route to refuel during your travel. NASA is grappling with similar issues as it gets ready to embark on a sustainable mission back to the Moon and plans future missions to Mars. But while your car’s fuel is gasoline, which can be safely and indefinitely stored as a liquid in the car’s gas tank, spacecraft fuels are volatile cryogenic liquid propellants that must be maintained at extremely low temperatures and guarded from environmental heat leaks into the spacecraft’s propellant tank. And while there is already an established network of commercial gas stations in place to make refueling your car a cinch, there are no cryogenic refueling stations or depots at the Moon or on the way to Mars. Furthermore, storing volatile propellant for a long time and transferring it from an in-space depot tank to a spacecraft’s fuel tank under microgravity conditions will not be easy since the underlying microgravity fluid physics affecting such operations is not well understood. Even with today’s technology, preserving cryogenic fuels in space beyond several days is not possible and tank-to-tank fuel transfer has never been previously performed or tested in space.\n\nHeat conducted through support structures or from the radiative space environment can penetrate even the formidable Multi-Layer Insulation (MLI) systems of in-space propellant tanks, leading to boil-off or vaporization of the propellant and causing tank self-pressurization. The current practice is to guard against over-pressurizing the tank and endangering its structural integrity by venting the boil-off vapor into space. Onboard propellants are also used to cool down the hot transfer lines and the walls of an empty spacecraft tank before a fuel transfer and filling operation can take place.  Thus, precious fuel is continuously wasted during both storage and transfer operations, rendering long-duration expeditions—especially a human Mars mission—infeasible using current passive propellant tank pressure control methods.\n\nZero-Boil-Off (ZBO) or Reduced Boil-Off (RBO) technologies provide an innovative and effective means to replace the current passive tank pressure control design. This method relies on a complex combination of active, gravity-dependent mixing and energy removal processes that allow maintenance of safe tank pressure with zero or significantly reduced fuel loss.\n\nAt the heart of the ZBO pressure control system are two proposed active mixing and cooling mechanisms to counter tank self-pressurization.  The first is based onintermittent, forced, subcooled jet mixing of the propellantand involves complex, dynamic, gravity-dependent interaction between the jet and the ullage (vapor volume) to control the condensation and evaporation phase change at the liquid-vapor interface. The second mechanism usessubcooled droplet injectionvia a spraybar in the ullage to control tank pressure and temperature. While the latter option is promising and gaining prominence, it is more complex and has never been tested in microgravity where the phase change and transport behavior of droplet populations can be very different and nonintuitive compared to those on Earth.\n\nAlthough the dynamic ZBO approach is technologically complex, it promises an impressive advantage over the currently used passive methods. An assessment of one nuclear propulsion concept for Mars transport estimated that the passive boil-off losses for a large liquid hydrogen tank carrying 38 tons of fuel for a three-year mission to Mars would be approximately 16 tons/year. The proposed ZBO system would provide a 42% saving of propellant mass per year. These numbers also imply that with a passive system, all the fuel carried for a three-year Mars mission would be lost to boil-off, rendering such a mission infeasible without resorting to the transformative ZBO technology.\n\nThe ZBO approach provides a promising method, but before such a complex technological and operational transformation can be fully developed, implemented, and demonstrated in space, important and decisive scientific questions that impact its engineering implementation and microgravity performance must be clarified and resolved.\n\nThe Zero Boil-off Tank (ZBOT) Experiments are being undertaken to form a scientific foundation for the development of the transformative ZBO propellant preservation method. Following the recommendation of a ZBOT science review panel comprised of members from aerospace industries, academia, and NASA, it was decided to perform the proposed investigation as a series of three small-scale science experiments to be conducted onboard the International Space Station. The three experiments outlined below build upon each other to address key science questions related to ZBO cryogenic fluid management of propellants in space.\n\nThe first experiment in the series was carried out on the station in the 2017-2018 timeframe. Figure 2 shows the ZBOT-1 hardware in the Microgravity Science Glovebox (MSG) unit of the station. The main focus of this experiment was to investigate the self-pressurization and boiling that occurs in a sealed tank due to local and global heating, and the feasibility of tank pressure control via subcooled axial jet mixing. In this experiment, the complicated interaction of the jet flow with the ullage (vapor volume) in microgravity was carefully studied. Microgravity jet mixing data was also collected across a wide range of scaled flow and heat transfer parameters to characterize the time constants for tank pressure reduction, and the thresholds for geyser (liquid fountain) formation, including its stability, and penetration depth through the ullage volume. Along with very accurate pressure and local temperature sensor measurements, Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) was performed to obtain whole-field flow velocity measurements to validate a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model.\n\nSome of the interesting findings of the ZBOT-1experiment are as follows:\n\nNon-condensable gases (NCGs) are used as pressurants to extract liquid for engine operations and tank-to-tank transfer. The second experiment, ZBOT-NC will investigate the effect of NCGs on the sealed tank self-pressurization and on pressure control by axial jet mixing. Two inert gases with quite different molecular sizes, Xenon, and Neon, will be used as the non-condensable pressurants. To achieve pressure control or reduction, vapor molecules must reach the liquid-vapor interface that is being cooled by the mixing jet and then cross the interface to the liquid side to condense.\n\nThis study will focus on how in microgravity the non-condensable gases can slow down or resist the transport of vapor molecules to the liquid-vapor interface (transport resistance) and will clarify to what extent they may form a barrier at the interface and impede the passage of the vapor molecules across the interface to the liquid side (kinetic resistance). By affecting the interface conditions, the NCGs can also change the flow and thermal structures in the liquid.\n\nZBOT-NC will use both local temperature sensor data and uniquely developed Quantum Dot Thermometry (QDT) diagnostics to collect nonintrusive whole-field temperature measurements to assess the effect of the non-condensable gases during both self-pressurization heating and jet mixing/cooling of the tank under weightlessness conditions. This experiment is scheduled to fly to the International Space Station in early 2025, and more than 300 different microgravity tests are planned. Results from these tests will also enable the ZBOT CFD model to be further developed and validated to include the non-condensable gas effects with physical and numerical fidelity.\n\nZBO active pressure control can also be accomplished via injection of subcooled liquid droplets through an axial spray-bar directly into the ullage or vapor volume. This mechanism is very promising, but its performance has not yet been tested in microgravity. Evaporation of droplets consumes heat that is supplied by the hot vapor surrounding the droplets and produces vapor that is at a much lower saturation temperature. As a result, both the temperature and the pressure of the ullage vapor volume are reduced. Droplet injection can also be used to cool down the hot walls of an empty propellant tank before a tank-to-tank transfer or filling operation. Furthermore, droplets can be created during the propellant sloshing caused by acceleration of the spacecraft, and these droplets then undergo phase change and heat transfer. This heat transfer can cause a pressure collapse that may lead to cavitation or a massive liquid-to-vapor phase change. The behavior of droplet populations in microgravity will be drastically different compared to that on Earth.\n\nThe ZBOT-DP experiment will investigate the disintegration, coalescence (droplets merging together), phase change, and transport and trajectory characteristics of droplet populations and their effects on the tank pressure in microgravity. Particular attention will also be devoted to the interaction of the droplets with a heated tank wall, which can lead to flash evaporation subject to complications caused by the Liedenfrost effect (when liquid droplets propel away from a heated surface and thus cannot cool the tank wall). These complicated phenomena have not been scientifically examined in microgravity and must be resolved to assess the feasibility and performance of droplet injection as a pressure and temperature control mechanism in microgravity.\n\nThis NASA-sponsored fundamental research is now helping commercial providers of future landing systems for human explorers. Blue Origin and Lockheed Martin, participants in NASA’s Human Landing Systems program, are using data from the ZBOT experiments to inform future spacecraft designs.\n\nCryogenic fluid management and use of hydrogen as a fuel are not limited to space applications. Clean green energy provided by hydrogen may one day fuel airplanes, ships, and trucks on Earth, yielding enormous climate and economic benefits. By forming the scientific foundation of ZBO cryogenic fluid management for space exploration, the ZBOT science experiments and CFD model development will also help to reap the benefits of hydrogen as a fuel here on Earth.\n\nDr. Mohammad Kassemi (Dept Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering, Case Western Reserve University)\n\nBiological and Physical Sciences (BPS) Division, NASA Science Mission Directorate (SMD)\n\nCuriosity and the desire to explore are traits deeply rooted in human nature.

But a fire aboard a space vessel would be different, since the flames would be subject to microgravity conditions. And that difference can occur in unexpected ways.\n\nHow? That’s the purpose of theSolid Fuel Ignition and Extinction (SoFIE)facility. While there’s some evidence that fires can be more dangerous in microgravity conditions, much more needs to be studied.\n\nContained in the space station’s existing Combustion Integrated Rack,SoFIEwill allow researchers to observe the ignition and flammability of solid spacecraft materials. Investigators will use these data to evaluate NASA’s 1-G materials flammability selection protocols for materials to be used in spacecraft or planetary habitats. SoFIE will also allow investigators to test microgravity flame suppression techniques.\n\nThis same data from the SoFIE experiments can also be applied to advancing fire safety on Earth. For example, to help determine how fire-safe a new material might be for use in your home, office – or even on a new ship.\n\nYes, even in space, you’ll find fungus – those tiny, replicating cells of mold that can form a thin and slimy coating, called biofilm, on different surfaces. What can be done to prevent their spread inside space habitats?\n\nEnter this investigation with the long name:The Characterization of Biofilm Formation, Growth, and Gene Expression on Different Materials and Environmental Conditions in Microgravity. At its outset, this investigation will characterize the mass, thickness, morphology, and the associated gene expression of this space biofilm.\n\nNext, researchers will look at the biomechanical and RNA mechanisms involved in the biofilm’s formation in space. Last, they’ll review the role of current material surfaces on biofilm formation, as well as introduce a novel material to test the surface’s resistance to the sticky substance.\n\nSpace Biology Program Scientist Sharmila Bhattacharya notes the significance of these experiments: “If we can better control the spread of space biofilms, it will help protect the health of crew on long-duration space missions. It will also protect any planets that we visit from these microbial life forms.” Back on Earth, getting new information on how to better fight molds also would be welcome to millions.\n\nIn 2014, the first plants were introduced to the Space Station viaVeggie– a plant growth chamber that uses LED lights and fans to circulate the station’s air. This system is small and uses water and nutrient delivery systems, so scaling in a space environment is a challenge due to mass, containment, maintenance, and sanitation issues.\n\nNow, a new phase of experimentation is about to take place: TheeXposed Root On-Orbit Test System (XROOTS)investigation will use hydroponic and aeroponic techniques to grow plants without soil. Integrated with the existing Veggie hardware, and using video, photographs and crew observations, theXROOTSinvestigation will evaluate nutrient delivery and recovery techniques such as aeroponics from a plant’s germination to its maturity.\n\nThe system features multiple independent growth chambers to evaluate alternative methods and configurations. And, once optimum growth conditions are found, this information will be helpful to Earth growers who could enhance the cultivation of plants in settings such as greenhouses, which, in turn, may contribute to better food security. Bon Appétit indeed – with a new twist.\n\nNASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences Divisionpioneers scientific discovery and enables exploration by using space environments to conduct investigations not possible on Earth.

This research could help protect astronauts on future long-duration missions to the Moon and Mars, while also advancing treatments for millions of people on Earth who suffer from osteoporosis.\n\nDuring long-duration missions, astronauts may experience a gradual reduction in bone density—typically around 1% to 2% per month—even with consistent exercise routines. While scientists understand how bones work on Earth, they aren’t sure exactly why bones weaken so quickly in microgravity.\n\nPrevious research aboard the space station revealed that microgravity changes how stem cells behave and what substances they release. Scientists now want to dig deeper into these cellular changes to better understand what causes bone loss in space and explore potential ways to prevent it.\n\nThe Microgravity Associated Bone Loss-B (MABL-B) investigation focuses on special stem cells called mesenchymal stem cells, or MSCs. As these cells mature, they build new bone tissue in the body.\n\nScientists suspect that a protein called IL-6 might be the culprit behind bone problems in space. Data from the earlierMABL-A missionsuggests that microgravity promotes the type of IL-6 signaling that enhances bone degradation. The MABL-B experiment will investigate this by testing ways to block this IL-6 signaling pathway.\n\nThe experiment will grow mesenchymal stem cells alongside other bone cells in special containers designed for space research. Cells will be cultured for 19 days aboard the space station, with crew members periodically collecting samples for analysis back on Earth.\n\nThe research could lead to targeted treatments that protect astronauts from bone loss during long-duration missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond. As crews venture farther from Earth, bone health becomes increasingly critical since medical evacuation or emergency return to Earth won't be possible during Mars missions.\n\nThe findings could provide new insights into age-related bone loss that affects millions of people on Earth. Understanding how the IL-6 protein affects bone health may lead to new treatments for osteoporosis and other bone conditions that come with aging.\n\nNASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences Divisionpioneers scientific discovery and enables exploration by using space environments to conduct investigations not possible on Earth. Studying biological and physical phenomenon under extreme conditions allows researchers to advance the fundamental scientific knowledge required to go farther and stay longer in space, while also benefitting life on Earth.", "ocr_text": "", "media_assets": ["https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/NASA_logo.png?w=300",

Applications of these spaceborne quantum sensors include tests of general relativity, searches for dark energy and gravitational waves, spacecraft navigation and drag referencing, and gravity science, including planetary geodesy—the study of a planet's shape, orientation, and gravity field.\n\nThe wave-particle duality of matter is a cornerstone of quantum mechanics. First hypothesized by Louis De Broglie in 1924, it postulates that every particle or quantum object can be described as either a particle or a wave, depending on how we measure the properties of the object.\n\nA natural consequence of the wave-like nature of quantum matter is that it can simultaneously exist in more than one place. When experimentalists measure the particle location, the simultaneous paths taken by the particle “collapse” to a single traceable trajectory. Quantum interferometry starts with particles in the same lowest energy state and then puts some of them in the first excited state and measures the phase difference between these two groups after they traverse a region of interest. Matter-wave interferometers have been experimentally demonstrated on Earth with numerous types of particles, including electrons, neutrons, atoms, antimatter, and even biomolecules.\n\nOver the last few decades, technology advancements have enabled cooling of atoms to temperatures below 1 microKelvin to form a fifth (purely quantum) state of matter called a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), making ultracold atom interferometers using this unique matter a leading candidate for future precision sensing of inertial forces. Analogous to high-precision optical interferometers (such as the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory [LIGO], which recently detected gravitational waves using highly stable optical waves), atom interferometers with BECs utilize extremely pure, low-velocity quantum gases to achieve high-precision, phase-sensitive measurements of fundamental forces including gravity. They also promise to deliver unprecedented acceleration and rotation sensitivity for inertial navigation. In fact, such atom interferometers are shown to be sensitive enough to detect variations in a gravitational field, and thus could be used to map the interior density of planets.\n\nAchieving atom interferometry in space had been a long-sought goal of NASA and the fundamental physics community. “The promise of very low temperature gases and effectively limitless free-fall time for space-based atom interferometry is expected to open a new regime of precision for inertial force and rotation measurements that could revolutionize both contemporary gravity science and spacecraft navigation capabilities in the near future,” said Dr. Jason Williams, a Principal Investigator for atom interferometry studies onboard ISS.\n\nIn May 2020, atom interferometry with an ultracold BEC of rubidium atoms was demonstrated for the first time on an orbiting platform. This experiment was realized by NASA’s multi-user Cold Atom Lab (CAL), which has been operating onboard the ISS since 2018. In January 2020, CAL received a Science Module capable of atom interferometry (pictured in Fig. 1) as part of an on-orbit upgrade. For the May 2020 demonstration, a laser pulse acted as the beam splitter for an atomic wave packet (as illustrated in Fig. 2). Subsequent laser pulses then recombined the atoms and mixed them to produce an interference pattern which was read out by taking pictures of atoms occupying the spatially separated outputs. This demonstration of matter-wave interferometry in space heralds a future in which space-based quantum sensors become a widely used tool for scientific exploration of the universe. Applications of the new technology include tests of general relativity, searches for dark energy and gravitational waves, spacecraft navigation, and prospecting for subsurface minerals on the moon and other planetary bodies.\n\nThe research was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (80NM0018D0004).

Included in these bulky supplies will be a handful of items that weigh no more than a few grams – a sampling of seeds, some microscopic proteins, and a few small worms. Yet it is these tiny organisms that may yield the biggest impact to this mission, affecting the future of space travel while delivering life altering benefits to those of us still on Earth.\n\nThree experiments, sponsored by NASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences Division, focus on the diversity of space biology and physical sciences:\n\nMeet Caenorhabditis elegans, a 1mm roundworm that shares a common trait with humans: muscle. Long space voyages present a unique challenge to astronauts: loss of muscle mass and strength. Can this tiny worm provide clues regarding how to mitigate this risk? The Micro-16 project will use this roundworm to see whether decreased expression of muscle protein is associated with decreased strength. The research team developed a new device that will measure muscle strength over multiple generations of worms that will be born and raised on the space station.\n\nOne of the ways scientists develop new drugs to fight disease is to use a process called protein crystallization which takes place when individual protein molecules are stabilized by crystal contacts. These crystals can grow differently in microgravity conditions than they do on Earth, producing a higher quality crystal. Real-time Protein Crystal Growth-2 on the space station is designed to demonstrate new methods for producing these high-quality protein crystals. Eight different proteins will be incubated on special growth plates inside the BioServeSpace Automated Bioproduct Labat precisely controlled set temperatures. At different times during incubation, the plates are removed and placed on the BioServe’s TS-100 microscope to locate and image any crystals that form. These images will then be used by the experiment’s principal investigators to design the next iteration of protein growth conditions.\n\nThink about what you might include in your next salad: some lettuce, Pac Choi, radishes, tomatoes, cauliflower, and a few peppers. A nutritious dish for you or any astronaut. But can these veggies grow and thrive in an extraterrestrial greenhouse if they’re exposed to too much radiation? That’s the driving question to the MISSE-Seed Experiment: to study the effects of long duration space exposure on crop seeds. For six months, eleven seed varieties will be exposed to the space environment outside the space station at the Materials International Space Station Experiment (MISSE) sample carrier’s Zenith position. The project will also examine a number of passive sample containment vessels to ascertain what type of storage units are optimal to preserve seeds or other biological samples during exposure to the space environment.\n\nAs Craig Kundrot, the Division Director of the Biological and Physical Sciences Division noted: “After the Cygnus spacecraft delivers its cargo, the big ideas that will emanate from these experiments will help give us the knowledge we’ll need to inhabit the Moon, Mars and beyond. At the same time, they’ll change what we know about biology and physical science on Earth, helping us find new ways to feed and improve the health of the world’s growing population.”\n\nThese investigations are supported by NASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences (BPS) Division as part of its mission to pioneer scientific discovery and enable exploration.

At the lab, horticulturalists study and propagate a range of horticultural crops and under this partnership, BPS-sponsored scientists at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida work to achieve faster growth and better, increased yields for diverse plant varieties.\n\nThe key to this process? Microbes.\n\nThe thought of microbes might conjure images of harmful mold or call to mind illness-causing viruses and bacteria. But certain microbes can actually benefit both human and plant health. With this project, scientists study plant-microbial interactions to determine which kinds of microbes enhance plant growth. And they’ve discovered one, the fungusCladosporium sphaerospermum.\n\n“We have a group here at Kennedy that tests what crops can be grown in spaceflight, based on factors including nutritional quality and overall biomass,” said Dr. Anirudha R. Dixit, one of the research scientists contracted at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center to conduct research under this partnership. “The focus of this research is to test the growth promotion abilities of this particular fungus on some of these crops to see if exposure to gases produced by the fungus could help increase their total biomass.”\n\nUSDA and NASA researchers worked together to sequence this fuzzy, powdery black fungus (dubbed ‘Black Magic’) for the first time, allowing them to monitor the genetic changes as it grows and develops. They’ve found that this specific strain does in fact help promote the growth of plants growing nearby and they suspect that these positive effects are due to volatile organic compounds produced by the fungus.\n\nEnvironmental Test Chambers (ETCs) developed through BPS funding could help confirm whether this theory is correct.\n\nIn addition to conducting fundamental research on microbes as well as plant growth and development testing, BPS’s other major role in this partnership was to design and build growth chambers specifically for these studies.\n\nThe USDA Biotechnology Lab is located at Walt Disney World’s EPCOT theme park and is visible to visitors who embark on the Living with the Land attraction, a boat ride that tells the history of farming and gives a glimpse into the varied research conducted at the lab. In December 2022, two chambers were delivered to the lab at EPCOT. Like those on the ground at Kennedy and similar to theAdvanced Plant Habitaton the International Space Station, the chambers provide USDA researchers with more active control for growth conditions including temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide (CO2) and lighting. The chambers also provide a more closed atmosphere that enables scientists to examine synergistic effects between microbes and plants.\n\n“With these chambers, we’re able to continue studying if these volatile compounds are indeed the cause of these growth promotion effects on the plants or if these effects are caused by the amount of CO2 that the fungus produces,” said Ray Wheeler, plant physiologist at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center. “If there are volatile compounds, we want to identify what they might be, why they benefit plant growth and the mechanisms behind this.”\n\nScientists at Kennedy have primarily conducted these microbial studies in lettuce and mizuna (a mild-tasting Brassica in the mustard family). These leafy greens were chosen for this research because they grow quickly, which allows scientists to harvest them sooner than they could other plant varieties and therefore repeat experiments more quickly.\n\nResearch conducted under this cross-agency collaboration has potential benefits both in space and on our home planet.\n\n“The original objective of this project was to figure out how to increase overall crop productivity in order to benefit terrestrial agriculture,” said Dixit. “We can also apply these methods in the spaceflight environment to maximize the overall productivity of plants grown in the limited space we have aboard spacecraft.”\n\nDeveloping new methods to increase plant yield may not only allow for a greater variety of plants to be grown and eaten in space, as has been done withVeggie experimentson the International Space Station, but these advancements could also contribute to more efficient and productive agricultural methods on Earth. In addition, the joint USDA/NASA plant research could have applications for commercial technologies that support sustainable farming on Earth.\n\n“If there’s a way to co-utilize these microbes or fungi where you deliberately inoculate them into the growing media of plants, it could potentially speed up the growth and produce better yields or quicker yields,” said Wheeler. “If we can clearly demonstrate this on the ground, then it would be nice to do a follow-up test in space to see if the same thing occurs in microgravity.”\n\nResearchers are working to expand the plant varieties investigated under this partnership to crops including tomatoes. In the future, scientists also aim to test this ground research in space, bringing the microbial magic to the cosmos.\n\nLearn more aboutNASA’s Plant Biology Program\n\nWebb is the premier observatory of the next decade, serving thousands of astronomers worldwide.

These experiments aim to pioneer scientific discovery, enable sustainable deep space exploration, and support transformative engineering.\n\nThe launch is scheduled to take place no earlier than Tuesday, January 30, at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida.\n\nPlants will play a crucial role in space exploration because they provide a source of fresh food for astronauts, revitalize habitat air, and help recycle resources. However, to use plants effectively for space exploration, it is important to understand how they grow under the harsh environments of space.  Many microbes that are intimately associated with plants are known to improve the plant’s ability to tolerate environmental stresses on Earth. These beneficial microbes could also confer similar advantages to plants in space; however, we do not know how exposure to the space environment alters these associations.\n\nPlant-Microbe Interactions in Space (Advanced Plant Experiments in Space;APEX-10) tests whether the beneficial microbe Trichoderma harzianum increases stress resilience and improves seedling growth of tomato plants (Lycopersicum esculentum) when the two are grown together in microgravity on the International Space Station. If so, this knowledge could help increase plant productivity on Earth as well as in space. The principal investigator for APEX-10 is Dr. Simon Gilroy with the University of Wisconsin, Madison.\n\nDespite rigorous exercise, astronauts face a major health problem in space travel: significant bone loss. The Role of Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Microgravity Induced Bone Loss - Part A (MABL-A) research assesses the effects of microgravity on bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), specifically their capacity to secrete bone-forming and bone-dissolving cytokines (small secreted proteins that affect other cells).\n\nMSCs are known to play a role in making and repairing skeletal tissues. Results could provide a better understanding of the basic molecular mechanisms of bone loss caused by spaceflight and normal aging on Earth. The principal investigator for MABL-A is Dr. Abba Zubair with the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida.\n\nMicrobes, such as bacteria, cause numerous human diseases on Earth. It is possible that these same microbes could adversely affect the health of astronauts as they embark on future space missions. Therefore, a deeper understanding of how the spaceflight environment influences microbial growth could help develop strategies to counter their harmful effects.\n\nBiological Research in Canisters-25 (BRIC-25) studies how microgravity affects the Accessory Gene Regulator (Agr) quorum-sensing system of Staphylococcus aureus, a bacterial pathogen that infects almost every human tissue and organ. The Agr quorum-sensing system is a key communication tool used by bacteria to form biofilms, regulate physiology, and affect their ability to cause disease.\n\nBy investigating the Agr system on the International Space Station, BRIC-25 researchers hope to uncover new insights into bacterial behavior in space. This knowledge could not only safeguard astronauts' health, but also improve our understanding of bacterial adaptations on Earth. The principal investigator for BRIC-25 is Dr.Kelly Rice, with the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida.\n\nNASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences Divisionpioneers scientific discovery and enables exploration by using space environments to conduct investigations not possible on Earth. Studying biological and physical phenomena under extreme conditions allows researchers to advance the fundamental scientific knowledge required to go farther and stay longer in space, while also benefitting life on Earth.", "ocr_text": "", "media_assets": ["https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/NASA_logo.png?w=300", "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/rice2021.jpg?w=960", "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/apex10-e1706625026402.jpeg", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/jsc2023e006587.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/esd/articles/2025/A90%20NASA%20Chesapeake%20Shawn%20Serbin.jpeg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/psd/solar-system/skywatching/2025/october/02_Jupiter%20and%20Saturn_Credit_Preston%20Dyches_CC%20BY-NC%202.0.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/gsfc-20171208-archive-e000760orig-stpatricksaurora-iotd.jpg?w=1024", "https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/AFRC2025-0013-02/AFRC2025-0013-02~large.jpg?w=1919&h=1536&fit=clip&crop=faces%2Cfocalpoint", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/uc-s03-working-file-horizontal-v02-2.png?w=1024", "https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/ARC-1969-A-16712/ARC-1969-A-16712~large.jpg?w=1920&h=1382&fit=clip&crop=faces%2Cfocalpoint", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/astro/exo-explore/exoplanet-artists-concepts/WISPIT%202%20b%20Wide%20Final.png?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/afrc2025-0030-83.jpg?w=1024", "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/rice2021.jpg", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/1-pia26662-dsc4667-enhanced-nr.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/cds/general/images/2023/09/exoplanetwatch-896.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/missions/hubble/galaxies/spiral/Hubble_NGC2775_potw2538a.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/img-3738.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/esd/articles/2025/hydroflame_banner.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/20240131-207a0543.png?w=1024", "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/themes/nasa-child/assets/images/nasa-logo@2x.png", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/iss070e001252.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/acd25-132-006.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/taking-in-the-view-surface-from-hls.png?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/esd/eo/content-feature/aerosols/images/aerosol_fine_fraction_depth_201008_hammer.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/content/dam/science/astro/programs/physics-of-the-cosmos/images/gwsig/gravitational_waves-16.gif", "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/zubair-3.jpg?w=720", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/psd/photojournal/pia/pia13/pia13126/PIA13126.tif?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/cds/general/images/2023/03/53636962950-44cdcf9882-o.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/astro/programs/exep/images/exo.png?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/missions/webb/science/2025/09/STScI-01K6196E18EPYF8RDEAQVA01Y3.png?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/cds/learn/science-activation-stories/2025/2025-0805-RiversofStarsandStories-30-moonactivity-sm-Brandi_Stewart.jpg?w=1024", "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/apex10-e1706625026402.jpeg?w=1000", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/missions/prism/prism-data-cube.png?w=1024", "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/zubair-3.jpg"], "referenced_urls": [], "provenance": {"parser_path": "external.news", "fetched_at": "2025-10-04T03:42:00.899925", "source_type": "html"}}, "grounded_entities": [{"text": "microgravity", "entity_type": "exposure", "id": "CUSTOM:EXPOSURE:MICROGRAVITY", "label": "microgravity", "source_obo": "CUSTOM", "confidence": 1.0, "spans": [[1874, 1886]]}, {"text": "International Space Station", "entity_type": "platform", "id": "CUSTOM:PLATFORM:ISS", "label": "ISS", "source_obo": "CUSTOM", "confidence": 1.0, "spans": [[0, 27]]}, {"text": "physiology", "entity_type": "assay", "id": "CUSTOM:ASSAY:PHYSIOLOGY", "label": "physiology", "source_obo": "CUSTOM", "confidence": 1.0, "spans": [[3548, 3558]]}], "referenced_ids": {"pmcid": [], "doi": [], "osdr_id": [], "taskbook_id": []}}

The ultimate goal of the TIDES initiative is to enable long-duration space missions and improve life on Earth through innovative research. Space Biology supported research will enable the study of the effects of environmental stressors in spaceflight on model organisms, that will both inform future fundamental research, as well as provide valuable information that will better enable human exploration of deep space.\n\nProposals for these eleven projects were submitted in response to ROSES-2022 Program Element E.9 “Space Biology Research Studies” (NNH22ZDA001N-SBR). This funding opportunity solicited ground studies using plant or animal models (or their associated microbes) to characterize the responses of these organisms to lunar regolith simulant similar to that found atNASA candidate landing sites for future lunar exploration missions. This funding opportunity represents a collaboration between the Space Biology Program and NASA’s Astromaterials Research and Exploration Science (ARES) Division within the Exploration Architecture, Integration, and Science (EAIS) Directorate at the NASA Johnson Space Center, who will be supplying the lunar regolith simulant required for these studies.\n\nSelected studies include (but are not limited to) efforts to 1) test the ability of lunar regolith to act as a growth substrate for crop-producing plants including grains, tomatoes and potatoes, 2) understand how growth in lunar regolith influences plant and microbial interactions, and how in turn, these interactions affect plant development and health, 3) identify and test bioremediation methods/techniques to enhance the ability of regolith to act as a growth substrate, and 4) understand how lunar dust exposure impacts host/microbial interactions in human-analogous model systems under simulated microgravity conditions.\n\nEleven investigators will conduct these Space Biology investigations from ten institutions in nine states. Eight of these awards are to investigators new to the Space Biology Program. When fully implemented, approximately $2.3 million will be awarded in fiscal years 2024-2027.\n\nSimon Gilroy, Ph.D. University of Wisconsin, Madison\n\nTailoring Lunar Regolith to Plant

Colloids are mixtures of microscopic particles suspended in fluids — substances that are part solid, part liquid. In our daily life, colloids are found in everything from toothpaste to ketchup, paint to liquid hand soap and are part of a field of study known as ‘soft matter.’\n\nAnother familiar experience with colloids: “settling,” which is when these mixtures separate into layers over time, pulled apart by gravity. That’s why researchers set out to study how these substances behave at a fundamental level in space — to prolong the “shelf life” of materials, both in space and on Earth.\n\nTo gather this data, researchers needed a special tool that would enable them to see deep into the world of these tiny particles. Enter NASA’s LMM — the Light Microscopy Module.\n\nSince 2009, scientists and researchers from six countries, including 27 universities and research organizations, have spent thousands of hours employing the remarkable power of this state-of-the-art light imaging confocal microscope facility to study a variety of physical and biological phenomena. Formerly housed in the Destiny module of the International Space Station, the LMM contributed greatly to scientific discovery.\n\nThe LMM has been used by private companies to find new ways to improve their consumer products. Procter & Gamble, for instance, received approval on three patent applications for new products as a direct result of the company’s research using the LMM.\n\nThe device also helped other engineers design the next generation of highly efficient quantum-dot-sensitized solar cells, greatly improve biomedical device technology, and deliver potential innovations in construction materials for use on Earth, the Moon, and Mars.\n\nDiane Malarik is currently the deputy director of NASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences Division, but in the 1990s, she was the project manager responsible for LMM’s initial design. As she recalls: “We designed payloads for the space shuttle, but they had much simpler designs and operation then. The equipment was designed to be used only once by a single investigator. When the idea of building an LMM to install in the space station came to light, we knew it would have to be used by at least four investigators and had to design it with a great deal more flexibility.”\n\nSince installation, the LMM was used in 40 experiments, capturing images instrumental in helping scientists and engineers understand the forces that control the organization and dynamics of matter at microscopic scales. In effect, the LMM has helped make the invisible world of colloids more visible.\n\nWhat made the LMM unique among microscopes was that it allowed scientists to use the microgravity environment to observe the separation of physical and biological mechanisms over much longer timescales than possible on Earth. And the microscope’s high-quality, three-dimensional images deepened our scientific understanding of multiple micro and macroscopic fields including heat transfer, colloid interaction, and phase separation. In doing so, it has enabled scientists to improve the efficiency of commercial products on Earth, as well as contributed to the greater scientific community’s understanding of colloids.\n\nHaving completed over a decade of research, the LMM’s last experiment took place in October 2021. During this time the LMM was used for research in soft matter/complex fluids (colloids and gels), fluid physics (heat pipes), biophysics (protein crystallization, drug delivery) and plant biology (gravity sensing in roots). Over 30 conference presentations have been given and approximately 50 journal publications published or are in development that use data directly from the space station LMM results.\n\nMuseum professionals hope that one day LMM can be preserved for others to interact with on Earth as well. Lauren Katz, program manager of NASA Artifacts and Exhibits, said she would be excited to oversee LMM’s potential use in future NASA exhibits and loan to museums. “We feel the inclusion of the LMM could serve as a fascinating introduction to how science in space can be conducted from Earth,” says Katz. “Further, because the microscope is controlled remotely, we believe this interactive feature could serve as the ‘cool’ factor as visitors control the microscope (or representative device) themselves.” Many factors will influence whether LMM is able to be returned to Earth, namely space constraints aboard both the space station and return vehicles. Regardless of LMM’s final destination, it’s legacy as a workhorse for science will remain.\n\nLMM Video(YouTube)LMM Experiments\n\nNASA’sBiological and Physical SciencesDivision pioneers scientific discovery and enables exploration by using space environments to conduct investigations not possible on Earth. Studying biological and physical phenomenon under extreme conditions allows researchers to advance the fundamental scientific knowledge required to go farther and stay longer in space, while also benefitting life on Earth.\n\nWebb is the premier observatory of the next decade, serving thousands of astronomers worldwide.

It includes a series of plant experiments conducted by students in a Fairchild-designed plant habitat similar to the Vegetable Production System (Veggie) on the International Space Station. Tens of thousands of middle and high school students and their teachers nationwide have contributed hundreds of thousands of data points and tested 180 varieties of edible plants for NASA, with four having been flown on the International Space Station based on the student's results.\n\nOn April 20, 2024, 400+ students and teachers from 75 schools across the nation (and world) gathered at Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden to participate in the annual Growing Beyond Earth Student Research Symposium. Participants presented their original ISS-analogue space crop research in-person to a panel of judges from NASA Kennedy Space Center and/or virtually to two dozen university and NASA scientists. Experiments ranged from “Effect of Sargassum Extract Fertilizer on Growth of Chervil Vertissimo” to “Magnetoelectric Effect on Purple Magic Pac Choi”. A big congratulations to all the teacher and student scientists who presented their research and much heartfelt appreciation to all involved in Growing Beyond Earth for inspiring and encouraging the next generation of explorers.\n\nMiddle or high school teachers interested in bringing Growing Beyond Earth Citizen Science into your classrooms are invited to join the upcoming information sessions, during which the Growing Beyond Earth team will explain the program and its implementation in the classroom (followed by a Q&A session).\n\nTwo Dates Available:June 10, 7-8 p.m. EST:Join the WebinarJuly 1, 11 a.m. - 12 p.m. EST:Join the Webinar\n\nThe Growing Beyond Earth project is supported by NASA under cooperative agreement award number NNH21ZDA001N-SciAct and is part of NASA’s Science Activation Portfolio.

This program element is part of Science Mission Directorate (SMD) Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences - 2022 (ROSES-2022) solicitation. These six research projects, involving recognized experts in the fields of biophysics, combustion science, complex fluids, fluid physics, and materials science, will use data contained in the PSI system and build on prior reduced-gravity research to advance fundamental research in the physical sciences.\n\nResearchers will investigate important problems with existing data from NASA’sPhysical Sciences Informatics(PSI) system. The online database contains data from completed physical science reduced-gravity flight experiments conducted on theInternational Space Station, Space Shuttle flights, free flying spacecraft, commercial cargo flights to and from the space station, or from related ground-based studies.\n\nOne of the selected studies will try to bridge the knowledge gap on how fires behave and how materials burn in partial gravity environments. The proposed work would leverage material flammability data in microgravity and normal gravity to predict burning behaviors and flammability boundaries of solid materials in partial gravity. As NASA and commercial space companies expand their exploration into deeper space, spacecraft fire safety has become more important. This project is led by Prof. Ya-Ting Liao (Case Western Reserve University).\n\nAnother selected investigation proposes a numerical simulation to model multiphase flow using data from Capillary Channel Flow – Phase Separation – Experiment Unit. Multiphase flow and heat transfer in confined geometries are important but challenging to simulate. This study proposes a multi-scale computational model that will enable efficient and accurate simulations of such flows in microgravity. Multiphase flows are critical for the design and operation of fluid and thermal systems in spacecraft; and this effort will help establish a multi-scale simulation infrastructure, which will enable simulation of thermal management systems in microgravity environments. The proposed simulation results will help inspire new experiments in the future. The project is led by Prof. Yue Ling (University of South Carolina).\n\nThe selected proposals are from six institutions in six states, with the total combined award amount of approximately $1.12 M during a two-year period.\n\nThe Physical Sciences Research Program is managed by theBiological and Physical Sciences Divisionin NASA's Science Mission Directorate. This program conducts fundamental and applied physical sciences research, with the objective of pioneering scientific discovery, enabling space exploration, and providing benefits on Earth.

A NASA-funded research team has developed a new device called the NemaFlex chip to measure muscle strength over multiple generations of worms born and raised on the International Space Station (ISS).\n\nAs NASA plans for long-duration spaceflights, maintaining muscle mass and strength will be critical for astronauts who embark on missions that expose them to long periods of microgravity and radiation. The lack of gravity experienced by astronauts during spaceflight is responsible for the loss of muscle mass and strength. To develop possible countermeasures, scientists hope to better understand exactly how exposure to the space environment alters muscle gene expression, leading to muscle loss and reduced strength.\n\nThe NASA-sponsored Micro-16 experiment team at Texas Tech University recently developed a new device, called NemaFlex, to enable continuous measurement of worm muscle forces. The NemaFlex microfluidic device contains a “forest” of tiny micro-pillars. As the worms crawl through the device, they exert muscle forces that deflect the micropillars. Scientists can measure the muscle strength of the worms based on this pillar deflection. Researchers have used this NemaFlex device on Earth to show that defects in >muscle contraction proteins lead to a decline in worm muscle strength.\n\nNemaFlex, along with cultures of live worms to be studied and measured in space, was launched to the ISS on February 20, 2021 as part of the Micro-16 experiment. To use the NemaFlex device, astronauts inject the live cultures ofC. elegansfrom the culture bags into the NemaFlex unit using a device called the Worm Loading Apparatus (WLA). The NemaFlex chip includes a viewing window placed over a camera to capture video of the worm activity for scientists to analyze on Earth. Multiple generations of space-rearedC. elegansare being grown, observed, and measured during the Micro-16 experiment.  The flight measurements will be compared with the results of muscle strength and gene expression analyses for worms bred on Earth.\n\nMicro-16 seeks to provide researchers with a better understanding of how spaceflight-dependent changes in gene expression are linked to muscle function. Results from this experiment may support the development of countermeasures to maintain crew member health during extended missions. Successful measurement of muscle strength in flight will demonstrate thatC. elegansis a comprehensive genomic model for studying muscle physiology changes in space and may enable meaningful translation of discoveries made inC. elegansto astronauts. The spaceflight experiment may also have important implications for sarcopenia (a syndrome characterized by progressive and generalized loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength that is an urgent public health problem on Earth). Additionally, it may produce a terrestrial model for testing potential therapeutic interventions to mitigate the decline of muscle strength during spaceflight.\n\nSiva Vanapalli, Ph.D., Texas Tech University\n\nThe Biological and Physical Sciences Division’s Space Biology Program\n\nA NASA-sponsored team at the University of Iowa (UI) is restoring and advancing the nation’s…\n\nWebb is the premier observatory of the next decade, serving thousands of astronomers worldwide.

Glass is generally transparent and fragile while metals are opaque and extremely strong; but under the right conditions, metals can form glass, and when they do, what results is an opaque, durable, scratch- and corrosion-resistant material that is often stronger than steel. Metallic glass is so versatile it can be used in iPhone cases, the lubricant-free gears of Moon rovers, and electrical transformers. Recently, experiments on theInternational Space Stationthat NASA’s Space Life and Physical Sciences Research and Applications (SLPSRA) division funded have revealed aspects of metallic glass formation that could open the door to even greater possibilities.\n\nCurrent research in the field is focused on determining which metals form the best glass and how that glass can be used. The three most commonly used metals are zirconium, palladium, and iron, in that order, and the big questions in metallic glass research are:\n\nUntil now, physicists tried to answer those questions by looking at what occurs at the temperature at which a molten metal actually transitions into a glass as it cools down. That transition point is called the glass transition temperature (Tg). What scientist Ken Kelton and his colleagues at Washington University at St. Louis discovered during their research project on the International Space Station is that the transition process actually starts while the metal is still a liquid, at a much higher temperature than Tg, and that by measuring how thick (viscous) the liquid is at that higher temperature, we can determine whether a glass will form and what some of its properties will be.\n\nKelton and his team performed two identical experiments that compared the temperatures at which liquid metals crystallized when they cooled down on the space station to the temperatures at which they crystallized when they cooled down on Earth. Gravity causes gases or liquids that are less dense than their surroundings to rise and those that are more dense to sink. This gentle motion creates what’s called gravitational stirring. That doesn’t happen in the microgravity environment of the space station, so the researchers wanted to see if the lack of gravitational stirring changed the liquids’ crystallization behavior. Microgravity makes it possible to measure things much more precisely than we can on Earth, so the team was confident any differences in the results would be accurate.\n\nIn addition, the team’s experiments were performed in the space station’sElectromagnetic Levitation Facility (EML), which suspends liquids in space using electromagnetic energy. EML facilities on Earth require so much power to break the hold of gravity and levitate the sample that they induce stirring. Recently, a feature was added to the space station EML that allows scientists to measure the electrical resistance of metallic liquids in the levitation chamber. No EML facility on Earth’s surface has this feature, and it made the most exciting findings of the team’s work possible.\n\nThe experiments produced two results the researchers didn't expect. The first is that the glass transition process starts far above Tg in liquid metals and the second is that, unlike other substances, above a certain temperature the electrical resistance in liquid metals doesn't increase when the temperature gets higher. Here's how that works.\n\nMost of us are familiar with the fact that when you heat pancake syrup it becomes thinner and pours more easily. This occurs because heat makes the syrup molecules move faster. When the syrup cools, it becomes thicker because the molecules move more slowly. Electrical resistance operates something like this.\n\nThe classic model of an atom (Illustration)is a nucleus of protons and neutrons with electrons orbiting the nucleus. When an atom is on its own, all of its electrons stay with it; but in metals, whether they are solid or liquid, the outer set of electrons (called the valence electrons) merge together into what is called “the electron sea.” They are shared by all the other atoms and, when properly stimulated from the outside, form an electron stream or electrical current.\n\nThink of a crowd of people. If they are standing still and you want to move through the crowd, it’s easy to do because you can walk in the spaces between the people. If they’re moving, however, it’s harder to get through the crowd because you can’t plan your route; and if they’re moving very fast, you start bumping into them and losing your balance. This is electrical resistance.\n\nAtoms move faster when they’re heated, so an electron stream trying to get through a heated liquid or solid has a hard time because it keeps running into rapidly moving atoms. These collisions and impediments are what cause electrical resistance, and the higher the temperature, the more resistance there is.\n\nWhat Kelton and his colleagues found was that, when some metal alloys are heated and become liquids, the electrical resistance doesn’t change much as the temperature increases. What surprised them was that, above certain temperatures, the electrical resistance of these metallic liquids doesn’t change at all! They don’t know why this happens, but they intend to find out. The answer could have a big impact on how we make things, especially things that have to withstand the extreme temperature swings and harsh conditions of space.\n\nThese two discoveries – that you can predict glass formation and type by measuring a molten metal's viscosity at temperatures far above Tg and that temperature doesn't affect electrical resistance at these temperatures – give physicists different places to set to work and a whole new set of phenomena to explore. Luckily for us, most of those phenomena will translate into practical applications that will make our lives easier. They may also translate into new materials that could improve long-term space travel. Who knows where we might end up when the universe is the limit.\n\nStay informedon other exciting SLPSRA research initiatives:\n\nhttps://science.nasa.gov/biological-physical\n\nFor daily updates, follow @ISS_Research,Space Station Research and Technology Newsorour Facebook.Follow theISS National Labfor information on its sponsored investigations.

Fortunately, NASA researchers have recently determined that lunar dust can be zapped away using a beam of electrons. NASA is exploring use of non-contact, electrostatic, dust-charging technology to protect the Agency’s important space assets without restricting mission parameters.\n\nThe lunar surface is covered by a layer of dust particles called regolith. These dust particles can be stirred up during robotic and human exploration activities or released by natural processes such as meteorite impacts. Apollo astronauts noted that lunar dust particles readily stuck to surfaces such as spacesuits, optical lenses, and thermal blankets, causing numerous problems. Apollo mission spacesuits were damaged by abrasive lunar dust and several astronauts noted that moon dust was resistant to cleaning efforts; even vigorous brushing could not remove it.\n\nNASA’s Artemis program will develop extensive resources on the Moon starting in 2024 and will require advanced technologies to enable a sustained lunar presence.  Mitigation of lunar dust adhesion will be central to these efforts and to Artemis’s success. However, lunar dust exhibits several characteristics that make it difficult to remove. For example, unlike Earth, the Moon does not have an atmosphere and magnetic field to protect its surface from solar radiation. The solar wind can electrically charge dust particles on the Moon, causing the charged particles to stick to each other and to other surfaces. In addition, lunar dust particles are very jagged and rough, which also increases their “sticking power.”\n\nA team at NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and Colorado University (CU), Boulder is developing new electron beam technology and a tool called a “Moon duster,” which can be used to remove dust on sensitive surfaces of hardware and spacesuits on the Moon. Unlike other technologies that require incorporating a complex design of active embedded layers on the surface to be cleaned, the Moon duster is a standalone, hand-held electron beam device that can be potentially used on any dust-covered space hardware on the Moon. “The Moon duster will be like a typical duster spray on your desk, but it operates without air,” imagined Dr. Inseob Hahn, a program technologist and the project lead at NASA/JPL.\n\nThis new electron-beam technology is based on insights gained from previous studies of the natural electrostatic dust lofting process that may occur spontaneously on the surface of airless bodies (e.g., the Moon and asteroids). The model developed to explain this dust lofting process is depicted below. When an electron beam or UV field is applied to a micro-cavity formed in a pile of dust, the induced secondary electrons or photoelectrons are collected by the surrounding dust particles, resulting in a substantial negative charge buildup on the dust particles’ surfaces. The repulsive force between these negatively charged dust particles ejects them off the surface.\n\nTo test the electron beam concept, the researchers at CU Boulder loaded a vacuum chamber with various materials coated with a NASA-manufactured “lunar simulant” designed to resemble Moon dust. After aiming an electron beam at the particles, the dust jumped off the material’s surface, usually in just a few minutes, as captured in the image below. The technique worked on a wide range of surfaces, including spacesuit fabric, glass, and solar panels. This new technology aims at cleaning the finest dust particles, which are difficult to remove using tools like a brush. The method removed an average of about 75-85% of the dust particles on the surfaces tested. The researchers are also experimenting with new ways to increase the cleaning efficiency of the electron beam.  The research results are very encouraging, and now the team is developing a testbed at NASA/JPL to evaluate how the technology will perform in the very cold Moon environment. Other team members conducting this research include Benjamin Farr, who completed the work as an undergraduate student in physics at CU Boulder, and Drs.

Thewinnersemerged from a record-breaking field of more than 200 applicants to earn cash prizes worth up to $500,000, if they have a flight-ready unit. Recipients may also have the opportunity to flight test their technologies.\n\nNASA's Biological and Physical Sciences (BPS)division is supporting the emerging space economy through challenges like TechLeap. The projects receive funding through theCommercially Enabled Rapid Space Science(CERISS) initiative, which pairs government research goals with commercial innovation.\n\nTwo awardees’ capabilities specifically address BPS research priorities, which include conducting investigations that inform future space crops and advance precision health.\n\nAmbrosia Space Manufacturing Corporation is developing a centrifuge system to separate nutrients from cell cultures — potentially creating space-based food processing that could turn algae into digestible meals for astronauts.\n\nHelogen Corporation is building an automated laboratory system that can run biological experiments without requiring astronaut involvement and may be able to transmit real-time data to researchers on Earth without having to wait for physical samples to return.\n\n\"The innovations of these small- and midsize businesses could enable NASA to accelerate the pace of critical research,” says Dan Walsh, BPS’s program executive for CERISS. “It’s also an example of NASA enabling the emerging space industry to grow and thrive beyond big corporations.\"\n\nEvery inch and ounce counts on a spacecraft, which means the winning teams have to think small while solving big problems.\n\nCommercial companies play a pivotal role in enabling space-based research — they bring fresh approaches to ongoing challenges. But space missions demand a different kind of innovation, and TechLeap teams face both time and size constraints for their experiments.\n\nWinners have six to nine months to demonstrate that their concepts work. That’s a significant contrast from traditional space technology development, which can stretch for years.\n\nThe research serves a larger purpose as well. The technology helps NASA \"know before we go\" on longer, deep-space missions to the Moon and Mars. Understanding how technologies behave in microgravity or extreme environments can prevent costly failures when astronauts are far from Earth.\n\nSmall investments in proof-of-concept technologies can bring in a high ROI. With the TechLeap Prize, BPS is betting that big ideas will come in small packages.\n\nTechLeap Prize - Space Technology Payload Challenge (STPC)\n\nSpace Technology Payload Challenge Winners\n\nCommercially Enabled Rapid Space Science Initiative", "ocr_text": "", "media_assets": ["https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/NASA_logo.png?w=300", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/jsc2023e006587.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/esd/articles/2025/A90%20NASA%20Chesapeake%20Shawn%20Serbin.jpeg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/psd/solar-system/skywatching/2025/october/02_Jupiter%20and%20Saturn_Credit_Preston%20Dyches_CC%20BY-NC%202.0.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/gsfc-20171208-archive-e000760orig-stpatricksaurora-iotd.jpg?w=1024", "https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/AFRC2025-0013-02/AFRC2025-0013-02~large.jpg?w=1919&h=1536&fit=clip&crop=faces%2Cfocalpoint", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/uc-s03-working-file-horizontal-v02-2.png?w=1024", "https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/ARC-1969-A-16712/ARC-1969-A-16712~large.jpg?w=1920&h=1382&fit=clip&crop=faces%2Cfocalpoint", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/astro/exo-explore/exoplanet-artists-concepts/WISPIT%202%20b%20Wide%20Final.png?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/bps/bps-general/TechLeapsLogo.png?w=500&h=144&fit=clip&crop=faces%2Cfocalpoint", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/afrc2025-0030-83.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/1-pia26662-dsc4667-enhanced-nr.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/cds/general/images/2023/09/exoplanetwatch-896.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/missions/hubble/galaxies/spiral/Hubble_NGC2775_potw2538a.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/img-3738.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/esd/articles/2025/hydroflame_banner.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/20240131-207a0543.png?w=1024", "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/themes/nasa-child/assets/images/nasa-logo@2x.png", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/iss070e001252.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/acd25-132-006.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/taking-in-the-view-surface-from-hls.png?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/esd/eo/content-feature/aerosols/images/aerosol_fine_fraction_depth_201008_hammer.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/content/dam/science/astro/programs/physics-of-the-cosmos/images/gwsig/gravitational_waves-16.gif", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/psd/photojournal/pia/pia13/pia13126/PIA13126.tif?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/cds/general/images/2023/03/53636962950-44cdcf9882-o.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/astro/programs/exep/images/exo.png?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/missions/webb/science/2025/09/STScI-01K6196E18EPYF8RDEAQVA01Y3.png?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/cds/learn/science-activation-stories/2025/2025-0805-RiversofStarsandStories-30-moonactivity-sm-Brandi_Stewart.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/missions/prism/prism-data-cube.png?w=1024"], "referenced_urls": [], "provenance": {"parser_path": "external.news", "fetched_at": "2025-10-04T03:42:01.536306", "source_type": "html"}}, "grounded_entities": [{"text": "microgravity", "entity_type": "exposure", "id": "CUSTOM:EXPOSURE:MICROGRAVITY", "label": "microgravity", "source_obo": "CUSTOM", "confidence": 1.0, "spans": [[2555, 2567]]}, {"text": "centrifuge", "entity_type": "exposure", "id": "CUSTOM:EXPOSURE:HYPERGRAVITY", "label": "hypergravity", "source_obo": "CUSTOM", "confidence": 1.0, "spans": [[1083, 1093]]}, {"text": "months", "entity_type": "duration", "id": "CUSTOM:DURATION:MEDIUM_DURATION", "label": "medium duration", "source_obo": "CUSTOM", "confidence": 1.0, "spans": [[2214, 2220]]}, {"text": "years", "entity_type": "duration", "id": "CUSTOM:DURATION:LONG_DURATION", "label": "long duration", "source_obo": "CUSTOM", "confidence": 1.0, "spans": [[2361, 2366]]}], "referenced_ids": {"pmcid": [], "doi": [], "osdr_id": [], "taskbook_id": []}}

NASA’s Artemis missions are preparing for a sustained human presence on and around the Moon, with the ultimate goal of sending humans to Mars. These deep-space destinations present health risks to astronauts that are qualitatively and quantitatively different from those associated with stays on the International Space Station (ISS). One of the most significant risks for astronauts venturing outside the protection of Earth’s magnetic field is ionizing radiation: Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR), Solar Particle Events (SPE), and the “albedo” radiation produced by the interaction of space radiation with the lunar surface. Exposure to ionizing radiation can result in an increased risk of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurological impairment.\n\nThe Lunar Explorer Instrument for space biology Applications (LEIA) aims to provide empirical data to help define these risks by measuring the biological effects of lunar radiation and reduced gravity using a well-studied microbe whose DNA has a lot in common with ours: baker’s yeast. Remarkably, yeast and humans have hundreds of similar genes, including those important to DNA damage responses, so understanding the effects of stress on yeast in space will help us develop countermeasures to protect humans. As an added dividend, LEIA will obtain precise measurements of the radiation environment on the lunar surface at the South Pole, near the anticipated landing site for Artemis III—the mission that will return humans to the Moon’s surface.\n\nLEIA is a suite of instruments that work together to characterize the lunar radiation environment and the biological response to it. The biological instrument, the BioSensor, is based on theBioSentinel CubeSatdeveloped at Ames Research Center as part of the Artemis I mission. The BioSensor has an autonomous microfluidic system in which yeast cells, kept in a dry dormant state for transit, are activated by adding a liquid culture medium to stimulate growth and metabolism over several days. The LEIA version of the BioSensor has 16 fluidic cards, each with 16 culture microwells, so the instrument can accommodate 256 samples and calibration standards. Each well is equipped with three Light-Emitting Diode (LED) lights, as well as a photodiode sensor to measure cell growth via optical density and metabolic activity using a color-changing oxidation-reduction (redox) indicator dye. Chronic, sublethal radiation damage to cells is a significant concern for astronaut health. The BioSensor detects these effects through changes in rates of metabolism and cell growth in the yeast.\n\nTwo radiation detectors will accompany the BioSensor as part of the LEIA suite. The Airborne Radiological Enhanced-sensor System (ARES), a radiation detector slated for use on the Artemis II and III missions, will measure time-resolved dose, dose rate, and energy deposition by charged particles from the solar wind and GCR. The Mini-Fast Neutron Detector (Mini-FND) will measure high-energy neutrons, which are a substantial component of lunar surface radiation and a significant risk to quantify for crewed missions. The Mini-FND is a miniaturized version of the International Space Station (ISS) Radiation Assessment Detector (ISS-RAD) FND. ARES was developed at NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC), and the Mini-FND is being developed by the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) in Boulder, CO.\n\nLEIA technology has roots in instruments with extensive flight heritage, yet several developments distinguish it from its predecessors. One example is the introduction of a “late-load” capability, enabling investigators to integrate the fluidic cards containing the yeast cells into the BioSensor at the end of the payload assembly. Late load allows fresh yeast cells to be flown, which mitigates the cell damage that occurs when yeast cells are stored in suboptimal environmental conditions during integrated lander testing and potential launch delays. This improvement ensures more direct measurements of the effects of the lunar surface environment.\n\nThe LEIA yeast strains, currently being developed by Principal Investigators (PIs) Mark Settles and Sergio Santa Maria at NASA Ames Research Center (ARC), represent a biotechnological development central to achieving the scientific aims of the mission. The LEIA experiments will include both strains flown on BioSentinel and additional strains engineered with modifications to DNA repair pathways, to provide data on how different components of cellular machinery interact to fix radiation-induced damage. In addition, LEIA will include yeast strains from theBioNutrients experiment, a project to develop microbial food sources that could provide astronauts with nutritional supplements produced on-demand during long-duration missions. Specifically, LEIA will study whether yeast engineered to produce antioxidants such as beta-carotene can maintain antioxidant production in the lunar environment. LEIA will also test yeast strains that include genes introduced to increase radiation resistance. Extensive research is underway to select flight strains that are robust enough to withstand pre-flight storage, launch, and transit, but sensitive enough to provide a measurable biological response to the lunar environment.\n\nLEIA is supported by a Payloads and Research Investigation on the Surface of the Moon (PRISM) Grant and is scheduled for delivery to the Moon by the Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program in 2026.\n\nDr. Mark Settles and Dr. Sergio Santa Maria (PIs), NASA Ames Research Center (ARC)\n\nNASA Biological & Physical Sciences (BPS) Space Biology Program; Exploration

When he and his colleagues at the University of Houston set out to study advanced crystallization processes as part of ground-based research before an upcoming spaceflight experiment, they had hoped to learn more about how crystals form and degrade. They ended up evaluating how drugs for malaria interact with each other at the molecular level and finding new ways to combine malaria drugs that may be more effective. Their methods might also have industrial applications that could improve everything from drug manufacturing and chemical preparation to agriculture and the environment.\n\nTo most of us, crystals mean jewelry, geodes, or science kits we were given as children.  Actually, the crystallization process is part of a huge number of phenomena that are central to our health and comfort. Crystals of calcium phosphate are part of our bones.  When crystals form where they aren’t supposed to, they can cause diseases like Alzheimer’s (amyloid beta-peptide fibril crystals) and gout (uric acid crystals). Most chemicals are developed as crystals because crystals are the most compact form of matter, and drugs are usually prepared as crystalline compounds, like tiny crystals of acetaminophen.\n\nThe basic mechanisms of crystallization were discovered in the 1960s and 1970s. Vekilov and his team reviewed them, decided to go a step further, and looked at how to interrupt the crystal formation process. They chose malaria as their platform of action.\n\nThe malaria parasite is a fully formed organism with a nucleus that contains many strands of DNA called chromosomes. In contrast, most bacteria do not have a nucleus and only one chromosome. The parasite is carried from place to place by a female Anopheles mosquito that lights on animals or human beings, sticks its long nose into their bodies, and extracts some blood on which it feeds. It transfers the parasite to the human host in the process. When the mosquito digests a meal, it breaks down the blood into its components, one of which is hematin. Hematin is toxic to the malaria parasite, so the parasite transforms it into a non-toxic crystal that neutralizes the poison. The researchers wanted to study how the parasite does this so they could find a way to stop the process and kill the organism.\n\nMalaria causes around 500,000 human deaths worldwide every year. The current drugs, although they all interrupt the crystallization of hematin that is the parasite’s Achilles heel, are becoming ineffective because the parasite is adapting to them. This is normal. All living organisms adapt to their environment and scientists will need to find new anti-malarials, antibiotics, and anti-fungals about every 30 years from now on to stay ahead of the adaptation process.\n\nVekilov and his colleagues wanted to try combinations of the four currently effective malaria drugs to see if they worked better when used together. The results were surprising. When combined randomly, the drugs often cancelled each other out and the parasites were not affected. Crystals have horizontal surfaces and vertical surfaces. The team discovered that successful drug combinations contained one drug that affected a horizontal surface and one that affected a vertical surface during crystal formation. They also discovered that they only made each other more potent at low concentrations; at high concentrations, they acted against each other again. This is contrary to common sense, which often says that more of a good thing is a better thing.\n\nThe double-surface combinations interrupted the hematin binding process at two separate points instead of one, destroying it more effectively and giving the parasite two things to which it has to adapt instead of one.  This will make future malaria treatments effective for longer periods of time.\n\n“NASA is delighted to have been one of the funding organizations supporting this research,” added Dr. Craig Kundrot, SLPSRA’s Director. “From a NASA perspective, this is fundamental research and, as often happens, many new applications are uncovered as the research makes unexpected discoveries. This ground research has prepared the way for Dr. Vekilov’s next set of experiments, which will take place on the International Space Station and will explore other aspects of hematin.”\n\nThe discovery also translates easily into the realm of materials science.\n\nUnderstanding how multiple modifiers affect crystallization in the world outside the body than the world within it has not been an area of emphasis for industry. The process is used in industry to separate products from one another, purify them, and select their final solid form. Crystallization is also a major player in why the earth stays firm, the way rocks are structured, and the consistency of rain, snow and hail. All of these things could be changed if the crystallization process could be manipulated more precisely. Using more than one modifier might be the key to that.\n\nA good example is influencing where rain will fall. This is done by adding modifiers to clouds that speed up ice crystal formation so cloud moisture is contained before it reaches a particular destination.\n\nWhat if multiple modifiers allowed scientists to move rain clouds into drought-stricken areas or over wildfires to quench the flames? What if drugs could be purified more easily, lowering prices and making them more available to poor countries? Using multiple crystallization modifiers might make all these things possible and more, because combining modifiers seems to have an additive effect and makes them more powerful than they are individually. The Houston team has taken the first step towards a promising future.\n\n“The results of these experiments will be particularly exciting for biomedicine,” said Sridhar Gorti, Ph.D., NASA’s Project Scientist for the investigation. “It is wonderful to see that knowledge of the physics of crystal growth may still have many more unexplored applications.”\n\nTo review the research findings in detail, go tohttps://rdcu.be/b0CVFand read Dr. Vekilov’s article inNature.\n\nStay informed on other exciting SLPSRA research initiatives:\n\nhttps://science.nasa.gov/biological-physical\n\nFor daily updates, follow @ISS_Research,Space Station Research and Technology Newsorour Facebook.

Proposals for these projects were submitted in response to ROSES-2021 Program Element E.9 “Space Biology: Plant Studies” (NNH21ZDA001N-SBPS).\n\nAs human exploration prepares to go beyond Low Earth Orbit (LEO), NASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences Division (BPS) is shifting its research priorities towards work that will enable organisms to Thrive In DEep Space (TIDES). These efforts will focus on determining the effects of multiple deep-space stressors, including deep space radiation and reduced gravity on plants that either serve as model organisms or can be used to produce food for crew.\n\nThe funding opportunity requesting these studies was created as a collaboration between BPS and the Space Radiation Element of the Human Research Program. While plant studies are of relevance to the fundamental science interests within space biology, the nutritional benefits of growing plants in LEO and/or in deep space for astronauts make plant research valuable to the Human Research Program, who will provide access to the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory at Brookhaven National Laboratory for some of the awarded studies.\n\nThe awarded proposals include an International Space Station study as well as multiple ground-based projects. Selected studies involve, but are not limited to, efforts to 1) characterize how plant and microbial interactions are affected by space radiation in combination with changes in gravity, 2) develop methods to grow plants in hostile environments that recapitulate aspects of the lunar and Martian surfaces, and 3) understand how space-related stressors, including radiation, impact plant telomere length and stability, a target that is universal to eukaryotes.\n\nSeven investigators from seven institutions in six states will conduct these space biology investigations. Five of these awards are to investigators new to the Space Biology Program within BPS. When fully implemented, about $1.7 million will be awarded in fiscal years 2023-2026.\n\nJohn Baker, Ph.D.Medical College of Wisconsin, Inc.,Determining the Impact of Space Radiation and Simulated Microgravity on Plant Root Microbial Community Composition and Function\n\nColleen Doherty, Ph.D.North Carolina State University,How Do Carbon Fixing Strategies Affect Nutritional Content Under High CO2?

Scientists use NASA data to track ecosystem changes and to develop tools for conserving life on land, in our ocean, and in freshwater ecosystems.\n\nMany of us associate the sound of a singing bird with the beauty of nature. In recent years, though, fewer chirps, tweets, and birdsong have been heard. It isn’t because birds have stopped singing, but because there are fewer of them. A2019 studyfrom Cornell’s Lab of Ornithology estimated that we’ve lost about 3 billion wild birds in North America, leaving 29% fewer than in 1970. Human actions are the principal reason.\n\nIt's not just the birds. Areportfrom the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services estimates that about one million plant and animal species are threatened with extinction. Woody Turner, program scientist for NASA's Biological Diversity Research Program, stated: “We are really at a global biodiversity crisis, losing not only entire species but also seeing decreases in the number of plants and animals that are important for natural ecosystems.”\n\nA biodiverse planet means life has many different ways to survive and thrive. But human actions are affecting the natural balance of life on Earth. This includes habitat loss fromdeforestation, land use changes, and climate change. Rising global temperatures, a moreacidicocean, and extreme weather events — from heat waves and droughts to floods and wildfires — are rapidly changing global ecosystems. Larger organisms often take thousands to millions of years to evolve and adapt to new climates. Earth’s climate is now changing faster than many species can handle.\n\nNASA is working with partners worldwide to monitor biodiversity changes in near real-time, linking satellite data to on-the-ground measurements. Through these measurements, scientists are working swiftly to learn what is happening and its impact on the planet.\n\nHow do we know what is happening to life on Earth? NASA satellites play a vital role in gathering biodiversity data from a distance, often from orbit; this is what we callremote sensing. According to Turner, when satellite imagery is combined with airborne andin-situor field data, it helps to show where plants and animals are living and thriving at a given time, allowing for long-term tracking of changes.\n\nDr. Laura Lorenzoni, program manager forNASA’s Ocean Biology and Biogeochemistry Program, echoed the importance of sustained and detailed satellite measurements for predicting future changes. Lorenzoni and her colleagues are using remote-sensing and field data, together with models, to answer questions about how climate change is altering marine ecosystems.\n\nNASA has also made a priority of researching impacts to biodiversity on land. For decades, scientists funded byNASA’s Biological Diversity Research Program and Ecological Forecasting Applications Programhave been using satellites to track biodiversity and ecosystem changes and to help develop tools to aid in conservation. For instance, NASA-funded researchers are developing forecasting tools formanaging wildlife migrationsalong the Yukon-to-Yellowstone corridor, and others aremapping changesin North American temperate forests due to disease and climate change.\n\nNew remote-sensing technologies can help expand our view of the environment and how it’s changing. This includes the advancement of satellites to collecthyperspectral data, which identify an object’s or organism’s composition based on how it interacts with light. This means an oak tree leaf will look different from a pine tree leaf.\n\n“Hyperspectral data will move us leaps and bounds in our understanding of biodiversity. It lets you see not just where vegetation is, but what it is, too,” said Dr. Allison Leidner, a conservation biologist and program scientist in NASA’s Earth Science Directorate. For example, instead of seeing just a green forest, scientists can identify that it is a forest of oak trees.\n\nWith the data, scientists can help identify how environmental changes impact different types of plants within ecosystems. This new insight can fill in missing information about how ecosystems are changing due to human actions — particularly in remote, hard-to-reach places — providing a more complete global picture.\n\nNASA’s upcomingEarth System Observatoryprogram will provide high-resolution open data to scientists for developing solutions that address both climate change and biodiversity losses. For example, thePlankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE)mission aims to uncover how climate change is impactingphytoplankton, the organisms at the center of the marine food web. With its Ocean Color Instrument, the PACE satellite will provide new high-resolution views of this microscopic ocean life. With these data, scientists will be able to track the changing state of phytoplankton in different ocean basins and regions, which is important to understanding ocean biodiversity.\n\nAlthough scientists do not have all the solutions yet, NASA’s current and upcoming missions provide or will provide critical insights into the effort to slow biodiversity loss. Through continued research and new technology, scientists worldwide are working to find solutions so we can enjoy birdsongs for generations to come.\n\nExplore Earth Science\n\nNASA's unique vantage point helps us inform solutions to enhance decision-making, improve livelihoods, and protect our planet.\n\nEarth Science Data\n\nFacts About Earth", "ocr_text": "", "media_assets":

These stresses include galactic cosmic radiation (GCR), solar particle events (SPEs), and reduced gravity. Notably, to date, biological experiments in space have mainly been conducted within Low Earth Orbit (LEO) (e.g., via the Space Shuttle Program, on the International Space Station (ISS), or small satellite missions). Only a few biological experiments have been conducted beyond LEO; therefore, the biological effects of conditions beyond LEO are still poorly understood.\n\nThe selected research projects seek to widen our understanding of biological responses beyond LEO by preparing experiments in which yeast, a eukaryotic microorganism, will be grown and monitored on the lunar surface utilizing the BioSensor hardware. This hardware consists of a microfluidic system that allows for the culturing of yeast and the measurement of cell growth and metabolic activity. The lunar surface is particularly distinctive in that organisms will experience a radiation environment that is unique from that found in LEO on the ISS, that includes GCR and neutrons, the latter of which are secondary particles generated from the interactions of primary particles with the lunar surface.\n\nThe announced awards will not involve the flight opportunity itself, but rather the integration of the proposed experimental payloads into the Biosensor hardware and biocompatibility testing on the ground to establish a functional experimental payload that is flight-ready for future missions. Awards will also support additional ground-based studies to examine the effects of simulated lunar conditions on the proposed model system.\n\nWhen the projects are ready for integration, the selected investigators will work with a team of NASA engineers for hardware integration and testing. These tests will include verifying the systems’ performance with the biology and the required reagents to confirm functionality. Flight readiness testing will demonstrate that the payload can execute operations as designed during a flight-like configuration and yield data readouts to ensure that science objectives will be met during a future flight mission.\n\nThese space biology investigations will be conducted by three investigators from two institutions in two states. When fully implemented, about $900,000 will be awarded in fiscal years 2022-2025.\n\nLynn Harrison, Ph.D.Louisiana State University SystemInvestigating Lunar Stress and Parkinson's Disease using an Alpha Synuclein Yeast Model\n\nSergio Santa Maria, Ph.D.NASA Ames Research CenterORGANA: Oxidation-Reduction potential and Genetic Assessments for New mission Applications\n\nAndrew Settles, Ph.D.  NASA Ames Research CenterFeasibility of synthetic biology countermeasures for human exploration beyond low Earth orbit\n\nWebb is the premier observatory of the next decade, serving thousands of astronomers worldwide.

The tool used to perform these experiments is called an atom interferometer, and it can precisely measure gravity, magnetic fields, and other forces.\n\nAtom interferometers are currently being used on Earth to study the fundamental nature of gravity and are also being developed to aid aircraft and ship navigation, but use of an atom interferometer in space will enable innovative science capabilities.\n\nPhysicists have been eager to apply atom interferometry in space, both to enable new measurements for space science and to capitalize on the extended free-fall conditions found in space. This could enable researchers to achieve unprecedented performance from these quantum sensors.\n\nThese interferometers, however, require exquisitely sensitive equipment, and they were previously considered too fragile to function for extended periods without hands-on attention. The Cold Atom Lab, which is operated remotely from Earth, has now demonstrated that it is possible to conduct atom interferometry in space. The CAL Science Team has published two papers so far documenting these experimental milestones.\n\nThe results of the first study, published in the November 2023 issue of Nature, described the demonstration of simultaneous atom interferometry with both rubidium and potassium quantum gases for the first time in space. The dual-species atom interferometer not only exhibited robust and repeatable operation of atom interferometry in Earth orbit, but it also served as a pathfinder for future experiments that aim to use quantum gases to test the universality of free fall, a key tenet of Einstein’s theory of general relativity.\n\nIn the second study, the results of which were featured in the August 2024 issue of Nature Communications, members of the science team used the CAL atom interferometer to measure subtle vibrations of the space station and to remotely measure the frequency of the atom interferometer laser— the first time ultra-cold atoms have been used to detect changes in the surrounding environment in space. This paper also reported on the demonstration of the wave-like nature of matter persisting for the longest ever freefall time (over a tenth of a second) in space.\n\n“Reaching these milestones was incredibly challenging, and our success was not always a given,” said Jason Williams, the Cold Atom Lab project scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. “It took dedication and a sense of adventure by the team to make this happen.”\n\nSpace-based sensors that can measure gravity with high precision have a wide range of potential applications. They could reveal the composition of planets and moons in our solar system, because different materials have different densities that create subtle variations in gravity.\n\nThe U.S.-GermanGRACE-FO(Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment Follow-on) mission is currently collecting gravity measurements using classical sensors that detect slight changes in gravity to track the movement of water and ice on Earth. A future mission using atom interferometry could provide better precision and stability, revealing even more detail about surface mass changes.\n\nPrecise measurements of gravity could also offer insights into the nature of dark matter and dark energy, two major cosmological mysteries. Dark matter is an invisible substance that makes up about 27% of the universe, while the “regular” matter that composes planets, stars, and everything else we can see makes up only 5%. Dark energy makes up the remaining 68% of the universe and is the driver of the universe’s accelerating expansion.\n\n“Atom interferometry could also be used to test Einstein’s theory of general relativity in new ways,” said University of Virginia professor Cass Sackett, a Cold Atom Lab principal investigator. “This is the basic theory explaining the large-scale structure of our universe, and we know that there are aspects of the theory that we don’t understand correctly. This technology may help us fill in those gaps and give us a more complete picture of the reality we inhabit.”\n\nAbout the size of a minifridge, the Cold Atom Lablaunched to the space stationin 2018 with the goal of advancing quantum science by placing a long-term facility in the microgravity environment of low Earth orbit. Thelab cools atomsto almost absolute zero, or minus 459 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 273 degrees Celsius). At this temperature, some atoms can form a Bose-Einstein condensate, a state of matter in which all atoms essentially share the same quantum identity. As a result, some of the atoms’ typically microscopic quantum properties become macroscopic, making them easier to study.\n\nQuantum properties can sometimes cause atoms to act like solid objects and sometimes like waves. Scientists don’t yet entirely understand how the building blocks of matter can transition between such different physical behaviors, but they’re using quantum technology like what’s available on the Cold Atom Lab to seek answers.\n\nIn microgravity, Bose-Einstein condensates can reach colder temperatures and can exist for longer, giving scientists more opportunities to study them. The atom interferometer is among several tools in the CAL facility enabling precision measurements by harnessing the quantum nature of atoms.\n\nDue to its wave-like behavior, a single atom can simultaneously travel two physically separate paths. If gravity or other forces are acting on those waves, scientists can measure that influence by observing how the waves recombine and interact.\n\n“I expect that space-based atom interferometry will lead to exciting new discoveries, fantastic quantum technologies impacting everyday life, and will transport us into a quantum future,” said Nick Bigelow, a professor at University of Rochester in New York and Cold Atom Lab principal investigator for a consortium of U.S. and German scientists who co-authored the studies cited above.\n\nDesigned and built at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Cold Atom Lab is sponsored by the Biological and Physical Sciences (BPS) Division of NASA's Science Mission Directorate at the Agency's headquarters in Washington DC and the International Space Station Program at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.

A series of physical science experiments testing micro gravity properties in space are driving global advances in science and technology. Through a number of innovative biological experiments, NASA is also finding new ways to help plants, animals and humans survive and thrive in spaceflight conditions. Investigations launching to the International Space Station on SpaceX’s 20th contracted commercial resupply services mission include the following:\n\nSeveral experiments will study combustion focusing on three primary goals: How can we improve fuel efficiency? How can we reduce combustion pollutants? How can we better prevent a fire inside a spacecraft? TheAdvanced Combustion via Microgravity Experiments (ACME)project is a series of six independent studies of gaseous flames that will be conducted in the Combustion Integrated Rack on board the orbiting laboratory.\n\nFive of the experiments are focused on improving how we use fuel on Earth. By developing computational models, scientists hope to improve the efficiency and reduce the pollutant emission in combustion machines. In addition, the computational simulation capability resulting from ACME could lead to reductions in the time and cost to design the next generation of combustion engines. Other ACME goals are to improve our understanding of combustion during limited fuel conditions where both optimum performance and low emissions can be achieved, as well as soot control and reduction – that is, oxygen-enriched combustion which would capture carbons before they were released into the air, and ﬂame stability and extinction limits, as well as the use of electric ﬁelds for combustion control.\n\nThe objective of the sixth experiment is focused on spacecraft ﬁre prevention. Scientists want to improve their fundamental understanding of materials ﬂammability such as extinction behavior and the microgravity conditions needed for sustained combustion. It will also help them assess the relevance of existing ﬂammability test methods as they screen and select materials for future spacecraft.\n\nPrincipal Investigators:Richard Axelbaum, Ph.D. Washington University in St. Louis,Derek Dunn-Rankin, Ph.D. University of California, Irvine, Irvine,Chung (Ed) Law, Ph.D. Princeton University,Marshall Long, Ph.D. Yale University,James Quintiere, Ph.D. University of Maryland\n\nDevelopers:NASA Glenn Research CenterZIN Technologies Incorporated\n\nFor thousands of years, humans have produced glass, metal alloys, and other materials by placing a mixture of raw materials in a container - called a crucible – and heating them to a high temperature. But, as melting begins, a chemical reaction can occur between the materials and the crucible, causing imperfections and contaminations. So what if you could avoid using the crucible? You can – in space.\n\nAboard the International Space Station, NASA will use the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency’s Electrostatic Levitation Furnace (ELF) handles materials using a containerless processing technique. This allows researchers to reduce imperfections, provide enhanced fidelity of results, and investigate the behavior of high-temperature manufactured materials including oxides, semiconductors, insulators and alloys which are only possible in the microgravity environment of space.\n\nThe ELF will soon perform two new experiments: TheThermophysical Property Measurementinvestigation will study small (~2mm) spheres of metal to provide a better understanding of how to measure liquid metal properties. The knowledge gained will help researchers better understand how to maximize the levitators of each. NASA is part of an international team of researchers for theOrigin Of Fragility In High-Temperature Oxide Liquidsexperiment that will, on the other hand, investigate what happens when high temperatures are applied to those same small spheres of various metal oxides. Oxides are a class of chemical compounds in which oxygen is combined with another element, in this case a metal. The spheres are heated by multiple laser beams to a high temperature, where the metal becomes a liquid. Metal oxides are developed for products such as thermal conductors and electrical insulators, and these liquids formed from these materials are expected to serve as precursors to products that are useful in advanced sensors, beneﬁting manufacturers and scientists designing new materials and manufacturing techniques that can be used both on Earth and in Space.\n\nPrincipal Investigator:Douglas M.

How do those particles form and blend with each other to become that object? Welcome to the world of colloids and nanostructures. In chemistry, a colloid is a mixture in which one substance of microscopically dispersed insoluble or soluble particles is suspended throughout another substance, much like tapioca pudding.  Scientists know temperature is a factor in determining how these microscopic particles bond with their surfaces and with each other. But another factor that’s been difficult to measure is the effect gravity has on these particles – until now.\n\nTheAdvanced Colloids Experiment Temperature-2 (ACE-T-2)experiment will look at the complex structures of these micron-scale colloidal particles, and how they assemble in micro gravity conditions. Using the electron microscope on board the station, scientists will observe these particle interactions when different temperatures are applied to them.\n\nThe experimental work emanates from an increasing demand for ever more complex, speciﬁcally designed micro and nano-scale structures for photonic and electric devices. Controlling how these complex 3D structures are assembled, however, is highly challenging. Through these experiments, and assisted by complex algorithms, scientists hope to gain a basic understanding of the assembly process to better grow complex nanostructured materials.\n\nThese Colloidal and nano-particles are good candidates to become the building blocks of some of tomorrow’s new materials. Applications of nano and micro materials are rapidly growing: this new particulate matter ﬁnds increasing applications in all parts of modern life ranging from food and drug industry to coating and painting to everyday electronic devices.\n\nPrincipal Investigator:Peter Schall, Ph.D\n\nCo-Investigators:Gerard Wegdam, Ph.D., University of Amsterdam, Institute of PhysicsSimon Stuij, University of Amsterdam, Institute of PhysicsPiet Swinkels, University of Amsterdam, Institute of PhysicsMarco A. C. Potenza, Ph.D., University of Milan\n\nDevelopers:NASA Glenn Research CenterZin Technologies Incorporated\n\nThere’s a relatively new technique that allows scientists to design and assemble complex three-dimensional structures from colloids. Those are particles of different sizes that are suspended in a fluid, similar in concept to how microbeads are suspended  in liquid soap. The technique is known as nanoparticle haloing (NPH) which uses highly charged nanoparticles to stabilize much larger, non charged particles. It is thought that the nanoparticles create a charge layer by forming a cage, or Halo, around the larger particles.\n\nOn Earth, gravity plays a role in how well particles are suspended in a fluid. But, by allowing these structures to form in the microgravity on board the International Space Station for theAdvanced Colloids Experiment-Nanoparticle Haloing (ACE-T-12)experiment, scientists hope to gain new insights into the relationship between the shape surface charge and concentrations of particles and the particle interactions.\n\nMicrogravity allows for the monitoring of particle behavior for longer time periods than on Earth, and this experiment will allow the ﬁrst observation of 3D aggregations formed by NPH. The resulting structure and its stability address fundamental issues in the science of condensed matter.\n\nSince self-assembled colloidal structures are vital to the design of advanced materials, this investigation will contribute to a fundamental understanding of nanoparticle haloing and the colloidal structures it creates. That lays the foundation for applying this technique to creating the next generation colloidal materials, including optically-based energy platforms and sensors, for use on Earth.\n\nPrincipal Investigators:Stuart J.

TheBiological Research in Canisters-Light Emitting Diode-002 (BRIC-LED)-002investigation tests whether spaceflight affects the ability of plants to defend themselves against pathogens.Arabidopsis thalianais a weed commonly found abutting the pavement on the back roads of Africa or Eurasia, popularly known as thale cress or mouse-ear cress.Arabidopsisis a model organism, commonly used by biologists due to its relatively small genome, making it ideal for research. Even though it has a complex multicellular frame, this particular weed is well-understood by scientists.\n\nWhile this particular plant does well in defending itself against pathogens on Earth, the results of this investigation could have important implications for any plant grown on board as part of a crew’s life support system. Specifically, researchers will grow the Arabidopsisplants in orbit grown for a period of up to 14 days. Then, crew members will apply a bacterial compound that triggers the plant’s defense responses. After one hour, they preserve the plant samples, and after a period of 12-24 hours, they freeze the samples using the ultra-cold freezer on the station. The plants are stored there until they return to Earth for analysis.\n\nResearch on plant function in microgravity also contributes to a better understanding of basic plant processes, which could support development of better agricultural practices on Earth.\n\nPrincipal Investigator:Simon Gilroy, Ph.D. University of Wisconsin-Madison\n\nFuture long-duration space missions will require crew members to grow their own food. Before they do, they’ll need to better understand how plants respond to microgravity and other challenges not found on Earth, and also refine the systems and procedures to support plant growth.\n\nVEG-PONDS-03will evaluate how plants - in this case lettuce - grow in a newly developed plant growth system known as PONDS, or Passive Orbital Nutrient Delivery System. On Earth, gravity naturally forces rainwater down into the ground to nourish a plant’s roots. The PONDS units have features that are designed to bypass the lack of gravity in order to distribute water. They are also able to increase the plant’s oxygen exchange and provide sufficient room for root growth.\n\nRed romaine lettuce was chosen for the testing because it has a baseline for its growth from several previous experiments in the Vegetable Production System (Veggie) where crew members grew and ate it in space. The plants are grown in mixtures of arcillite, a porous material. Prior to launch, the PONDS units are packed with arcilite and time-release fertilizer, just like you use in potting soil at home. In space, the PONDS units are placed in the Veggie facility and supplied with water to initiate plant growth. Observations on plant tissue samples will provide insight regarding any growth differences when compared with control plants grown on Earth. Additional tests aim to monitor the microbial changes that are present in space grown crops, providing baseline data for future food production eﬀorts.\n\nVEG-PONDS-03 is a direct follow-on to the VEG-PONDS-01 and VEG-PONDS-02 hardware and plant growth validation tests. VEG-PONDS-01 tested growth of a single organism: Mizuna mustard. VEG-PONDS-03 now includes Dragoon Lettuce, Red Russian Kale, Extra Dwarf Pak Choi, Wasabi Mustard, and Red Romaine Lettuce. By demonstrating plant growth in this newly developed system, crew members may soon be able to grow even more crops, from new leafy greens to dwarf fruit plants in space.\n\nBack on Earth, scientists are already exploring how the technology used in the Veggie plant growth facility could be adapted for use in roof top gardens in densely populated areas where there is little room for growing plants.\n\nPrincipal Investigators:Howard G. Levine, Ph.D. NASA Kennedy Space CenterYe Zhang, Ph.D. NASA Kennedy Space Center\n\nDeveloper:NASA Kennedy Space Center\n\nOf all the risks associated with long term space travel, one of the most hazardous is exposure to radiation – these invisible particles have sufficient energy to change or break DNA, which can damage or kill a cell. Too much exposure can lead to health problems ranging from short to long term effects. Radiation particles emanate from galactic cosmic rays originating outside our solar system, and by the Sun during solar flares. Crew members aboard the space station receive some protection from Earth’s atmosphere and magnetic field, but radiation will become are much bigger challenge when they travel to the Moon or Mars\n\nTo better understand the biological impact of space radiation on cells, NASA launched a long-term radiation exposure experiment calledEvaluation of ISS Environmental Radiation Damage on Cryopreserved Mammalian Cells (Rad-Dorm)to the space station in late 2018 and will return aboard Dragon in April. Prior to launch, cryopreserved cells were placed into biological canisters. On board the space station, the canisters containing the frozen cells were placed in the Minus Eighty Degree Laboratory Freezer (MELFI) and then transferred to another even colder freezer at minus 160C.  Scientists will analyze DNA damage and other cellular features to better understand how different cells respond to long duration exposure to space radiation.\n\nThis data will provide valuable information for evaluating the biological impact of true space radiation and assisting in radiation risk assessments. Also, it potentially will beneﬁt other radiation research on Earth, giving researchers a better understanding of how cells respond to exposure of different radiation sources.\n\nPrincipal Investigator:Ye Zhang, Ph.D. NASA Kennedy Space Center\n\nCo-Investigators:Abba C.

Combustion sparked the industrial revolution, and today it provides us with", "published_at": "2020-07-16T06:05:00-04:00", "authors": ["NASA Science Editorial Team"], "tags": ["Science &amp; Research", "Biological & Physical Sciences", "Biological &amp; Physical Sciences"], "body_text": "5 min read\n\nMost of the energy and power used on Earth comes from burning fossil fuels. Combustion sparked the industrial revolution, and today it provides us with reliable power, clean water, a stable food supply and a whole lot more. Unfortunately, one downside of all that progress is pollution, which leads to climate change.\n\nTo help address this problem, investigators for NASA’sAdvanced Combustion via Microgravity Experiments (ACME)are studying the properties of flames in the apparent weightlessness of the International Space Station (ISS). Over 1,000 flames have been ignited for the first five ACME experiments. What researchers learn from these thousand points of light could improve the use of combustion on Earth.\n\n“Over 85 percent of the world’s energy comes from burning things,” said professor Richard Axelbaum, an ACME investigator. “Fossil fuels and combustion give us energy and power in any place, at any time of day, and at any time of year. No other source of energy can do this. Wind and water power have been used for thousands of years. They are much more efficient today, but you still can’t depend on them—or on solar energy—to produce power at all times. Fossil fuels can do that.”\n\nThe ACME experiments focus on improving efficiency and reducing pollution, including soot emissions and carbon dioxide releases that occur during combustion, which could slow climate change. Because Earth’s gravity determines the shape, and therefore the burning characteristics, of flames on our planet, ACME scientists have taken flames to space to find new ways to make them cleaner and more efficient. Furthermore, some ACME researchers study combustion in space to ensure that spacecraft are as fire-safe as possible.\n\nACME scientists say that there are two basic ways to burn things: mix air (or oxygen) and fuel together and burn the mixture, or just burn fuel in the air like we do when we burn a candle. All six ACME experiments are exploring non-premixed flames (like candle flames) of gaseous fuels, and all the experiments are being performed with ACME hardware in the Combustion Integrated Rack (CIR) on the space station.\n\nThe hardware is set up by the ISS astronauts, but it is operated remotely from NASA’s Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio. So far, over 20 astronauts from Canada, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, and the United States have taken part in ACME research. In order of operation, the ACME investigations are:\n\nCoflow Laminar Diffusion Flame (CLD Flame)Researchers from Yale University and Russia’s Far Eastern Federal University are using the investigation’s benchmark microgravity data to improve computational models of flames which could be extended into design tools for improved combustion systems on Earth.\n\nElectric-Field Effects on Laminar Diffusion Flames (E-FIELD Flames)Researchers from University of California Irvine and Russia’s Far Eastern Federal University are researching how flames are affected by a high-voltage electric field and exploring how that may be used so that they produce less pollution.\n\nBurning Rate Emulator (BRE)Researchers from the University of Maryland and Russia’s Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University are exploring how microgravity affects the way solids and liquids burn through an innovative approach using gaseous fuels. The researchers want to determine the conditions under which materials used in spacecraft interiors will burn, in order to improve spacecraft safety.\n\nFlame DesignResearchers from Washington University at St. Louis, the University of Maryland, and the N.N. Semenov Institute of Chemical Physics of the Russian Academy of Sciences are exploring new ways to eliminate soot from combustion but still produce strong flames that won’t quench.\n\nStructure and Response of Spherical Diffusion Flames (s-Flame)Researchers from Princeton University, Rutgers University, and the P.N. Lebedev Physical Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences are exploring how to improve computational models of flame development and extinction.\n\nA sixth ACME experiment will continue to expand our understanding:\n\nCool Flames Investigation with Gases (CFIG)Researchers from the University of Maryland, Washington University in St. Louis, and the University of California at San Diego will gain a new understanding of low-temperature combustion that may lead to cleaner, more efficient internal combustion engines. On-orbit testing for the CFIG experiment hasn't begun yet. but the E-FIELD Flames investigation has been completed. ACME testing is scheduled to continue into 2021.\n\n“The ACME series of experiments on the ISS are a triple success: advancing scientific knowledge, improving life on Earth and enabling exploration of space,” said Space Life and Physical Sciences Research and Applications Division Director Craig Kundrot. “ The weightless environment on ISS enables investigators to advance the scientific understanding about the fundamental mechanisms of combustion and thereby provide the knowledge to improve combustion processes on Earth and increase fire safety in human exploration missions.”\n\nMany phenomena have been part of our lives since the dawn of civilization, and we often take them for granted. Fire is one of them. Understanding everything we can about these building blocks of our world allows us to use our world efficiently and expand our potential as thinking, creative human beings. We have learned a great deal about fire here on Earth. Now we are taking it into space to learn more about it, because the novel microgravity behavior can enable leaps in understanding combustion – both in space and on Earth.   What we find will improve our lives on this planet and allow us to reach other worlds and discover all they have in store.\n\nStay informedon other exciting SLPSRA research initiatives:\n\nhttp://science.nasa.gov/biological-physical\n\nFor daily updates, follow @ISS_Research,Space Station Research and Technology Newsorour Facebook.Follow theISS National Labfor information on its sponsored investigations.

But", "published_at": "2020-04-30T17:00:00-04:00", "authors": ["NASA Science Editorial Team"], "tags": ["Science &amp; Research", "Biological & Physical Sciences", "Biological &amp; Physical Sciences"], "body_text": "9 min read\n\nBalloons are often associated with meteorological studies—gauging weather conditions such as temperature, pressure and humidity in the Earth’s atmosphere. But for NASA and other scientists, they also serve as a stepping-stone for other critical space research.\n\nMore recently, biological sciences researchers have started using balloons as an experimentation platform. In the context of NASA’s plannedArtemisand Mars missions, access to “near space” can advance scientists’ understanding of how biological organisms respond to extreme environments analogous to those found on the Moon and Mars. High-altitude and scientific balloons provide experimental access to various levels of rarefied air, as far up as the stratosphere (above 99% of the atmosphere). This enables researchers to gain initial data about the effects of higher levels of radiation and other factors on biological systems in a more cost-effective and timely manner than if they were to wait for an opportunity to run their experiments on the International Space Station or other orbital platforms.\n\nBalloons come in many forms, ranging from the off-the-shelf models used by students and educators to scientific ones as large as a football stadium utilized by academic researchers and industry. This article will describe some of the ways that these balloons are helping to advance biological sciences research and support space exploration.\n\nSmall high-altitude balloons, also known as meteorological or weather balloons, are a low-cost, fast-track option for experiments that require frequent repetition. Often used by students and educators, missions are short-lived, lasting until the balloon bursts during ascent, which is typically one to four hours after being released. NASA also uses small high-altitude balloons as well. One key difference, however, is that NASA’s balloons, regardless of size, are made from polyethylene film whereas weather balloons are made of rubber.\n\nPayloads are also small, up to 12 pounds suspended in two packages, and subject to landing wherever the wind may take them. Additionally, given that balloons are uncrewed, experiments must be designed in a way to run independently of human control and may be developed and flown in a matter of weeks using commercially available products and applications.\n\n“With some basic knowledge about mission architecture and how to reliably recover a payload, balloon teams can do some really impactful work that would require more time and resources through traditional space-study flight opportunities,” says David J. Smith, director of theAerobiology Lab at NASA’s Ames Research Center. “And it’s exciting to see the new ways that students are using them to study biological phenomena here on Earth as well.”\n\nFor example, in the summer of 2018, California wildfires were rampant. College interns with the Space Life Sciences Training Program (SLSTP) at NASA’s Ames Research Center saw an opportunity to study the effects of the wildfires on airborne microbiomes, such as bacteria, viruses and fungi.\n\nOne of the interns, Tristan Caro, now a doctoral candidate with the University of Colorado Boulder, drew inspiration from research findings he’d read about, published by Smith. “I came across something that I thought was really unique, which was people studying how microbes survive in the high atmosphere,” says Caro. “This seems very unintuitive because when you're flying on a plane, for example, you look out the window and there's just nothing, maybe there are some clouds below, but it's basically just void.”\n\nSmith’s research had discovered intact bacterial spores and cells that had traveled from Asia across the Pacific Ocean to North American via dust plumes. “It got us thinking about the possibility that the smoke might be lofting microbes up into the air,” says Jordan McKaig, one of the interns and president of the student board of the American Society of Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR). “We wanted to see if the microbes could survive the extreme conditions and possibly travel with the weather patterns.”\n\nThe team, therefore, set out to design the experiment and gather the materials necessary to build a payload. It required an interdisciplinary approach, bringing together life sciences, engineering and computer programming. “Success can depend on how you build your payload and what type of electronics you need to put on it,” continues Caro. “We chose an Arduino, which is a tiny, inexpensive computer you can buy online—it essentially taught me how to code, which has become a really valuable skill for my research.”\n\nOnce the team was ready, they notified the local Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) of their launch plans. Although the payload didn’t exceed the threshold weight and technically didn’t require FAA clearance, the SLSTP team still followed protocol, as balloon trajectories are unpredictable.\n\nThere are other variables that can affect the outcome of a balloon experiment as well. With the SLSTP project, the first balloon landed in a 100-foot-tall redwood tree and wasn’t recoverable for weeks; a second balloon launched one week later was recovered but failed to collect samples. “Failure has to be an option,” continues McKaig. “If you're not making some mistakes with your science, you’re probably not taking enough risks. But because small balloons are relatively inexpensive and easy to do, you’re able to take more of them.”\n\nIn short, small meteorological balloons are a relatively easy and affordable way to conduct life-science experiments, further STEM education and excite rising generations of scientists. Whereas smaller meteorological balloons provide a valuable entry point for students and educators, larger scientific balloons provide the next level of experimental access for professional researchers.\n\nLearn more:NASA’s Scientific Balloon Program\n\nPlants will play a crucial role in enabling space exploration by providing a sustainable source of nourishment for the crew as well as offer the psychological benefits that come with being in the proximity of greenery. Growing plants in space, however, will require a deeper understanding of how these living organisms respond to extreme environments, including radiation. That’s where NASA’s facility in Antarctica can offer researchers the most robust balloon research platform for preparing deep-space experiments. Support for the Antarctic campaign is provided by the National Science Foundation Office of Polar Programs.\n\n“Not since the Apollo era have seeds made it outside of the Van Allen belts to sample radiation,” says Robert Ferl, distinguished professor and director of horticultural sciences at the University of Florida. “And it's been 50 years since we've studied the effects of that very real radiation on our biological systems. We can learn by putting plants in extreme environments that are more accessible to us, such as high altitudes at the magnetic pole in Antarctica, where the radiation is most analogous to Mars’. This prepares us to take humans and our biology off planet.”\n\n“Plants are what will allow humans to travel past the capacity of a picnic basket,” adds Anna-Lisa Paul, research professor in horticultural sciences and director of the Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research at the University of Florida and NASA space biology research scientist. “So, when we leave Earth's orbit, we must take plants with us. Understanding how plants respond to spaceflight environments is the kind of thing that not only excites us as fundamental researchers, but also as people who want to see humanity take that next step in exploration.” Both Ferl and Paul are NASA-funded principal investigators in space biology research.\n\nHowever, given the remoteness and logistical challenges of the Antarctic location, flight opportunities are scarce and highly competitive. Those who earn the privilege of flying on one of the Antarctic missions—typically one or two missions per year—also benefit from prolonged exposures to space-like conditions because of the way ionizing radiation spills into the Earth’s polar atmosphere.\n\nSince the cold and radiation conditions afforded by the southern pole can provide valuable insights into how these microbes might behave in space, researchers also use the location to study extremophilic microbes—organisms such as spore-forming bacteria—and learn critical information about how spacecraft “stowaways” might affect the health of astronauts or planetary environments inadvertently encountered.\n\nIn addition to extreme cold, dryness and near-vacuum conditions at float, many other factors make missions launched from Antarctica unique and advantageous to researchers seeking space-like exposures. Firstly, there’s a consistent source of power. The summertime Antarctic sun doesn't dip below the horizon, so balloons equipped with solar panels get continuous power to their payloads, which can enable missions to last weeks, and even months.\n\nSecondly, Antarctica’s stratospheric wind patterns offer a level of predictability for the balloon’s path. The jet stream reliably flows in a circle around the continent during the austral summer, so that when the helium-filled balloon goes up and starts to drift, it often circles back near the location from which it was launched around eight to 14 days later. This reduces the level of effort required to recover payloads landing on the Antarctic ice.\n\nAnd thirdly, the radiation quality is different. The Earth’s magnetic fields around the planet allow for incoming solar and galactic radiation to funnel into the poles. This establishes radiation levels much closer to what would be encountered in deep space, so researchers are able to conduct experiments within “natural” environments rather than man-made settings.\n\nThe benefits are considerable, but the path to Antarctica can be long and complex. Payloads typically start their journey south in July, fly in December or January and begin the trip home in April or May. The nearly year-long process means that the experiments must be resilient enough to withstand long periods in a form of stasis.\n\nRead more:Nineteen Miles Up, Experiment Reveals Earth Microbes’ Likely Fate on Mars\n\nBalloons can be a valuable platform for biological researchers. For students and educators, smaller meteorological balloons offer an easy, cost-effective way for furthering STEM education. For professional biologists looking to measure how microbes or plant seeds respond to space conditions, larger scientific balloons enable robust radiation exposures. And for technologists hoping to eventually test payloads or instruments on the space station, larger balloons provide a coveted opportunity for quickly maturing hardware.\n\nStay informed on space biology & physical sciences research:Space Experiments\n\nFor daily updates,follow @ISS_Research,Space Station Research and Technology Newsorour Facebook.Follow theISS National Labfor information on its sponsored investigations.

It includes a series of plant experiments conducted by students in a Fairchild-designed plant habitat similar to the Vegetable Production System (Veggie) on the International Space Station.\n\nOn November 18th, 2023, South Florida High School student, Leonardo Ravelo, was awarded the 2023 American Society of Gravitational Space Research (ASGSR) Inspiration Scholarship: Laurence Davin and Norman Lewis Prize during the annualASGSRAnnual Conference for his work with the Growing Beyond Earth project. Leo is an 11th grader at iMater Academy in Hialeah, Florida. Since his freshman year, he and his classmates and teacher, Dr. Monique Salazar, worked together to design and build a clinostat (random positioning machine) that would allow them to grow plants in simulated microgravity.\n\nAn amazing accomplishment for Leo!

This one-year funding opportunity aims to expand the pool of professional scientists who use citizen science techniques in their science investigations. We’d like to remind you about two key changes to the CSSFP program this year!\n\nFirst, we heard that researchers could make better use of seed funding if it arrived in time to enable work during the summer — a crucial season for students, faculty, and interns.  To address this need, NASA is shifting the submission and review process to earlier in the year. The planning start date for CSSFP investigations for this next round is now May 1, 2025! Of course, an earlier start date means an earlier due date, sothis year’s CSSFP proposals will be due November 19, 2024.Proposers are also asked to submit a Notice of Intent (optional) by October 1, 2024 to aid in planning the review panels.\n\nSecond, if you are a current CSSFP grant recipient, you have the opportunity torequest a No Cost Extension,which will allow you to continue spending your remaining funding during a second year. However, please note: the NASA Shared Services Center will reject late requests!All no-cost extension requests must be received more than 10 calendar days prior to the end date of your grant’s period of performance.Please check that date and be sure to submit your No Cost Extension requests more than 10 days prior.\n\nWe’re excited to receive your proposals and can’t wait to help you do NASA

These fuels must be kept at ultra-low cryogenic temperatures to remain in liquid form; however, solar heating and other sources of heat increase the rate of evaporation of the liquid and cause the pressure in the storage tank to increase. Current storage methods require venting the cryogenic propellant to space to control the pressure in fuel tanks.\n\nNASA's Zero Boil-Off Tank Noncondensables (ZBOT-NC) experiment is the continuation of Zero Boil-Off studies gathering crucial data to optimize fuel storage systems for space missions. The experiment will launch aboard Northrop Grumman’s 23rdresupply mission to the International Space Station.\n\nEven with multilayer insulation, heat unavoidably seeps into cryogenic fuel tanks from surrounding structures and the space environment, causing an increase in the liquid temperature and an associated increase in the evaporation rate. In turn, the pressure inside the tank increases. This process is called “boil-off” and the increase in tank pressure is referred to as “self-pressurization.”\n\nVenting excess gas to the environment or space when this process occurs is highly undesirable and becomes mission-critical on extended journeys. If crew members used current fuel storage methods for a years-long Mars expedition, all propellant might be lost to boil-off before the trip ends.\n\nNASA's ZBOT experimentsare investigating active pressure control methods to eliminate wasteful fuel venting. Specifically, active control through the use of jet mixing and other techniques are being evaluated and tested in the ZBOT series of experiments.\n\nZBOT-NCfurther studies how noncondensable gases (NCGs) affect fuel tank behavior when present in spacecraft systems. NCGs don't turn into liquid under the tank's operating conditions and can affect tank pressure.\n\nThe investigation, which is led out of Glenn Research Center, will operate inside the Microgravity Science Glovebox aboard the space station to gather data on how NCGs affect volatile liquid behavior in microgravity. It’s part of an effort to advancecryogenic fluid managementtechnologies and help NASA better understand low-gravity fluid behavior.\n\nResearchers will measure pressure and temperature as they study how these gases change evaporation and condensation rates. Previous studies indicate the gases create barriers that could reduce a tank's ability to maintain proper pressure control — a potentially serious issue for extended space missions.\n\nThe research directly supports Mars missions and other long-duration space travel by helping engineers design more efficient fuel storage systems and future space depots. The findings may also benefit scientific instruments on space telescopes and probes that rely on cryogenic fluids to maintain the extremely low temperatures needed for operation.\n\nThe investigation could improve tank design models for medical, industrial, and energy production applications that depend on long-term cryogenic storage on Earth.\n\nStay up-to-date with the latest content from NASA as we explore the universe and discover more about our home planet.\n\nThe Power of Partnerships AVATAR is a collaborative effort between NASA, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), the…\n\n“Passengers” the size of a USB drive will accompany Artemis II crew on their journey around the Moon.

Proposals for these projects were submitted in response to ROSES-2021 Program Element E.11 “Space Biology: Animal Studies” (NNH21ZDA001N-SBAS).\n\nAs human exploration prepares to go beyond Low Earth Orbit, NASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences Division (BPS) is shifting its research priorities towards work that will enable organisms to Thrive In DEep Space (TIDES). These efforts will focus on determining the effects of multiple deep-space stressors, including deep space radiation and reduced gravity on multiple animal models.\n\nSelected studies involve, but are not limited to, efforts to 1) characterize the ability of dietary countermeasures to mitigate the negative effects of radiation exposure in mammals, 2) determine how exposure to various types of space-relevant radiation affects cognitive and neurological function, and 3) how exposure to simulated levels of fractional and hyper-gravity impact animal physiology.\n\nThe selection of these awards was made possible through a collaboration between BPS and the Space Radiation Element of the NASA Human Research Program, which will provide access to the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory at Brookhaven National Laboratory for many of the awarded studies.\n\nTwelve investigators from eight institutions in seven states will conduct these space biology investigations. Six of these awards are to investigators new to the Space Biology Program within BPS. When fully implemented, about $3.55 million will be awarded in fiscal years 2023-2026.\n\nCraig Willis, Ph.D.Ohio University,The Effect of Different Genetic Mutations and Pharmacologic Interventions on Transcriptional Responses to Spaceflight in C. elegans\n\nMarie Mortreux, Ph.D.Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Inc.,Circadian Rhythm Disruption and Gravitational Disturbance in a Lunar Mission Analog: Consequences for Muscle Function During and After the Mission\n\nSeward Rutkove, Ph.D.Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Inc.,Acute and Long-Term Effects of Combined Radiation and Partial Unloading on Neurological and Musculoskeletal Systems in Male and Female Rats\n\nAshley Blackwell, Ph.D.Eastern Virginia Medical School,Feasibility study: Use of Neural Networks to Predict Adaptability and Multiday Performance Saving in Dual Motor-Cognitive Tasks After Exposure to Space Flight Stressors\n\nHeather Allaway, Ph.D.Louisiana State University and A&M College,Insights Into the Impacts of Continuous, Low Dose-Rate Neutron Radiation Exposure on Maternal and Fetal Skeletal Physiology\n\nAnand Narayanan, Ph.D.Florida State University,Partial Gravity and Sex-Difference Effects on the Venous Circulation\n\nJanani Iyer, Ph.D.NASA Ames Research Center,Sex-Specific Physiological and Transcriptomic CNS Responses to Combined Effects of Spaceflight Stressors in Drosophila Melanogaster\n\nElizabeth Blaber, Ph.D.Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,Unraveling the Role of Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Senescence on Inhibition of Tissue Regeneration During Spaceflight and Amelioration by a Novel Countermeasure, PQQ\n\nSylvain Costes, Ph.D.NASA Ames Research Center,Characterization of Female Reproductive Health Risks for Long-Duration Spaceflight Using Federated Machine Learning\n\nJoshua Alwood, Ph.D.NASA Ames Research Center,Integrated CNS Assessment in Rodent Models of Altered Gravity and Irradiation\n\nCaralina Marin de Evsikova, Ph.D.Bay Pines Foundation, Inc.,Stressors to Spaceflight: Identification of Transposon-Driven Changes to Gene Networks in GeneLab Data\n\nCassandra Juran, Ph.D.NASA Ames Research Center,Sustained Effects of Spaceflight on Anemia and Severity of Effects Dependency on Age\n\nWebb is the premier observatory of the next decade, serving thousands of astronomers worldwide.

The six investigations aim to contribute to cutting-edge discoveries by NASA scientists and research teams. The SpaceX Dragon spacecraft will liftoff aboard the company’s Falcon 9 rocket from Launch Complex 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida.\n\nScience experiments aboard the spacecraft include a test to study smothering fires in space, evaluating quantum communications, analyzing antibiotic-resistant bacteria, examining health issues like blood clots and inflammation in astronauts, as well as growing romaine lettuce and moss in microgravity.\n\nPutting out a fire in space requires a unique approach to prioritize the safety of the spacecraft environment and crew. The SoFIE-MIST (Solid Fuel Ignition and Extinction - Material Ignition and Suppression Test) is one of five investigations chosen by NASA since 2009 to develop techniques on how to contain and put out fires in microgravity. Research from the experiment could strengthen our understanding of the beginning stages of fire growth and behavior, which will assist in building and developing more resilient space establishments and creating better plans for fire suppression in space\n\nResistance to antibiotics is as much of a concern for astronauts in space as it is for humans on Earth. Research determined that the impacts of microgravity can weaken a human’s immune system during spaceflight, which can lead to an increase of infection and illness for those living on the space station.\n\nThe GEARS (Genomic Enumeration of Antibiotic Resistance in Space) investigation scans the orbiting outpost for bacteria resistant to antibiotics and these organisms are studied to learn how they thrive and adapt to microgravity. Research results could help increase the safety of astronauts on future missions as well as provide clues to improving human health on Earth.\n\nMicrogravity takes a toll on the human body and studies have shown that astronauts have had cases of inflammation and abnormally regulated blood clotting. The MeF-1 (Megakaryocytes Orbiting in Outer Space and Near Earth: The MOON Study (Megakaryocyte Flying-One)) investigation will conduct research on how the conditions in microgravity can impact the creation and function of platelets and bone-marrow megakaryocytes. Megakaryocytes, and their progeny, platelets, are key effector cells bridging the inflammatory, immune, and hemostatic continuum.\n\nThis experiment could help scientists learn about the concerns caused by any changes in the formation of clots, inflammation, and immune responses both on Earth and during spaceflight.\n\nThe work continues to grow food in the harsh environment of space that is both nutritious and safe for humans to consume. With Plant Habitat-07, research continues on ‘Outredgeous’ romaine lettuce, first grown on the International Space Station in 2014.\n\nThis experiment will sprout this red lettuce in microgravity in the space station’s Advanced Plant Habitat and study how optimal and suboptimal moisture conditions impact plant growth, nutrient content, and the plant microbiome. The knowledge gained will add to NASA’s history of growing vegetables in space and could also benefit agriculture on Earth.\n\nARTEMOSS (ANT1 Radiation Tolerance Experiment with Moss in Orbit on the Space Station) continues research that started on Earth with samples of Antarctic moss that underwent simulated solar radiation at the NASA Space Radiation Lab at Brookhaven National Lab in Upton, New York.\n\nAfter exposure to radiation some of the moss samples will spend time on the orbiting outpost in the microgravity environment and some will remain on the ground in the 1g environment. ARTEMOSS will study how Antarctic moss recovers from any potential damage from ionizing radiation exposure when plants remain on the ground and when plants grow in spaceflight microgravity. This study leads the way in understanding the effects of combined simulated cosmic ionizing radiation and spaceflight microgravity on live plants, providing more clues to plant performance in exploration missions to come.\n\nThe SEAQUE (Space Entanglement and Annealing Quantum Experiment) will experiment with technologies that, if successful, will enable communication on a quantum level using entanglement. Researchers will focus on validating in space a new technology, enabling easier and more robust communication between two quantum systems across large distances. The research from this experiment could lead to developing building blocks for communicating between equipment such as quantum computers with enhanced security.\n\nRelated resources:\n\nNASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences Divisionpioneers scientific discovery and enables exploration by using space environments to conduct investigations not possible on Earth. Studying biological and physical phenomenon under extreme conditions allows researchers to advance the fundamental scientific knowledge required to go farther and stay longer in space, while also benefitting life on Earth.\n\nAt the International Astronautical Congress (IAC) taking place in Sydney this week, representatives from the…\n\nCuriosity and the desire to explore are traits deeply rooted in human nature.

You and the millions of other volunteers have enabled an incredible banquet of discoveries—by taking data, analyzing data, writing code, writing papers, and even inventing your own science projects. Your work helps us maintain our leadership in space science!\n\nOur scientists have shared examples of many outstanding volunteers. Here are just a few of the remarkable amateur scientists/citizen scientists whose help we’re so grateful for:\n\nDani Abrasfrom theFjordPhytoproject.\n\n“Dani Abras has been an exemplary facilitator of the FjordPhyto program with travelers in Antarctica. Her enthusiasm for engaging people in the natural world is infectious and her love of participatory science draws people into the wonderful microscopic world of phytoplankton. She is a very enthusiastic and engaged Expedition Guide and you might even see her featured in our new online training course on the NASA Infiniscope platform.”  –Allison Cusick\n\nEmily Gregoryfrom theFjordPhytoproject.\n\n“Emily is an Expedition Team Member with Intrepid and enthusiastically facilitates FjordPhyto with travelers each year.”  –Allison Cusick\n\nMr. Kevvyfrom the“Are we Alone in the Universe?”project.\n\n“Mr. Kevvy goes above and beyond as a moderator of `Are we alone in the universe?’. He is always reaching out to me and letting me know what our volunteers have been experiencing, as well as going out of his way to look for other collaborations our project might be interested in. His insight is always extremely helpful, and many of his ideas have made it into our final products. I enjoy working with him and am grateful for his support.”  –Megan Li\n\nNicholas Brereton, Emmanuel Gonzalez, and Stefan Greenfrom theGenelab Microbes Analysis Working Group.\n\n“Over the course of ~6 years, the open-access data in NASA GeneLab/Open Science Data Repository was mined by this 100% volunteer group in  the Microbes Analysis Working Group, which resulted in this recent publication:Spaceflight alters host-gut microbiota interactionsAll authors in the publication could/should get kudos, but especially the ones listed above who saw it through” –Ryan Scott\n\nWant to join this illustrious group and make a lasting mark on  NASA science?

The system uses red, blue, and green LED lights to provide the right spectrum for plant growth. Clear flexible bellows — accordion-like walls that expand to accommodate maturing plants — create a semi-controlled environment around the growing area.\n\nAstronauts plant thin strips containing their selected seeds into fabric \"seed pillows\" filled with a special clay-based growing medium and controlled-release fertilizer. The clay, similar to what's used on baseball fields, helps distribute water and air around the roots in the microgravity environment.\n\nCrew members will monitor the plants, add water as needed, and document growth through regular photographs. At harvest time, astronauts will eat some of the fresh produce while freezing other samples for return to Earth, where scientists will analyze their nutritional content and safety.\n\nFresh food will become critical as astronauts venture farther from Earth on missions to the Moon and Mars. NASA aims to validate different kinds of crops to add variety to astronaut diets during long-duration space exploration missions, while giving crew members more control over what they grow and eat.\n\nThe techniques developed for growing crops in space's challenging conditions may also improve agricultural practices on Earth. Indoor crop cultivation approaches similar to what astronauts do in Veggie might also be adapted for horticultural therapy programs, giving elderly or disabled individuals new ways to experience gardening when traditional methods aren't accessible.\n\nVEG-03 MNO on the Space Station Research Explorer\n\nVeggie Vegetable Product System\n\nVeggie Plant Growth System Activated on International Space Station\n\nNASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences Divisionpioneers scientific discovery and enables exploration by using space environments to conduct investigations not possible on Earth. Studying biological and physical phenomenon under extreme conditions allows researchers to advance the fundamental scientific knowledge required to go farther and stay longer in space, while also benefitting life on Earth.", "ocr_text": "", "media_assets": ["https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/NASA_logo.png?w=300", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/jsc2023e006587.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/esd/articles/2025/A90%20NASA%20Chesapeake%20Shawn%20Serbin.jpeg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/psd/solar-system/skywatching/2025/october/02_Jupiter%20and%20Saturn_Credit_Preston%20Dyches_CC%20BY-NC%202.0.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/gsfc-20171208-archive-e000760orig-stpatricksaurora-iotd.jpg?w=1024", "https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/AFRC2025-0013-02/AFRC2025-0013-02~large.jpg?w=1919&h=1536&fit=clip&crop=faces%2Cfocalpoint", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/uc-s03-working-file-horizontal-v02-2.png?w=1024", "https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/ARC-1969-A-16712/ARC-1969-A-16712~large.jpg?w=1920&h=1382&fit=clip&crop=faces%2Cfocalpoint", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/astro/exo-explore/exoplanet-artists-concepts/WISPIT%202%20b%20Wide%20Final.png?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/afrc2025-0030-83.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/1-pia26662-dsc4667-enhanced-nr.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/cds/general/images/2023/09/exoplanetwatch-896.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/missions/hubble/galaxies/spiral/Hubble_NGC2775_potw2538a.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/img-3738.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/esd/articles/2025/hydroflame_banner.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/20240131-207a0543.png?w=1024", "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/themes/nasa-child/assets/images/nasa-logo@2x.png", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/iss070e001252.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/acd25-132-006.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/taking-in-the-view-surface-from-hls.png?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/esd/eo/content-feature/aerosols/images/aerosol_fine_fraction_depth_201008_hammer.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/content/dam/science/astro/programs/physics-of-the-cosmos/images/gwsig/gravitational_waves-16.gif", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/psd/photojournal/pia/pia13/pia13126/PIA13126.tif?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/cds/general/images/2023/03/53636962950-44cdcf9882-o.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/astro/programs/exep/images/exo.png?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/missions/webb/science/2025/09/STScI-01K6196E18EPYF8RDEAQVA01Y3.png?w=1024", "https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/KSC-20250529-PH-CSH01_0070/KSC-20250529-PH-CSH01_0070~large.jpg?w=1920&h=1080&fit=clip&crop=faces%2Cfocalpoint", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/cds/learn/science-activation-stories/2025/2025-0805-RiversofStarsandStories-30-moonactivity-sm-Brandi_Stewart.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/missions/prism/prism-data-cube.png?w=1024"], "referenced_urls": [], "provenance": {"parser_path": "external.news", "fetched_at": "2025-10-04T03:42:02.575477", "source_type": "html"}}, "grounded_entities": [{"text": "microgravity", "entity_type": "exposure", "id": "CUSTOM:EXPOSURE:MICROGRAVITY", "label": "microgravity", "source_obo": "CUSTOM", "confidence": 1.0, "spans": [[1425, 1437]]}, {"text": "International Space Station", "entity_type": "platform", "id": "CUSTOM:PLATFORM:ISS", "label": "ISS", "source_obo": "CUSTOM", "confidence": 1.0, "spans": [[297, 324]]}, {"text": "long-duration", "entity_type": "duration", "id": "CUSTOM:DURATION:LONG_DURATION", "label": "long duration", "source_obo": "CUSTOM", "confidence": 1.0, "spans": [[1937, 1950]]}], "referenced_ids": {"pmcid": [], "doi": [], "osdr_id": [], "taskbook_id": []}}

Four of the selected proposals call for ground-based research to help NASA identify and develop the foundation for future space-based experiments.\n\nThe Cold Atom Laboratory (CAL) provides an opportunity to study ultra-cold quantum gases in the microgravity environment of the space station. This environment makes it possible to conduct research in a way unachievable on Earth because atoms can be observed over a longer period, and mixtures of different atoms can be studied free of the effects of gravity, where cold atoms can be trapped more easily by magnetic fields.\n\nThe selected proposals are from seven institutions in seven states, with the total combined award amount of approximately $9.6 million over a five-year period.\n\nThe Fundamental Physics Program is managed by theBiological and Physical Sciences Divisionin NASA's Science Mission Directorate. This program performs carefully designed research in space that advances our understanding of physical laws, nature's organizing principles, and how these laws and principles can be manipulated by scientists and technologies to benefit humanity on Earth and in space.\n\nBelow is the complete list of the selected proposals, principal investigators, and their organizations:\n\nWebb is the premier observatory of the next decade, serving thousands of astronomers worldwide.

Unfortunately, even the simplest terrestrial plant watering methods face significant challenges when applied aboard spacecraft due to rogue bubbles, ingested gases, ejected droplets, and myriad unstable liquid jets, rivulets, and interface configurations that arise in microgravity environments.\n\nIn the weightlessness of space, bubbles do not rise, and droplets do not fall, resulting in a plethora of unearthly fluid flow challenges. To tackle such complex dynamics,NASA initiated a series of Plant Water Management (PWM) experiments to test capillary hydroponics aboard the International Space Station in 2021.The series of experiments continue to this day, opening the door not only to supporting our astronauts in space with the possibility of fresh vegetables, but also to address a host of challenges in space, such as liquid fuel management, Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC); and even urine collection.\n\nThe latest PWM hardware (PWM-5 and -6) involves three test units, each consisting of a variable-speed pump, tubing harness, assorted valves and syringes, and either one serial or two parallel hydroponic channels. This latest setup enables a wider range of parameters to be tested—e.g., gas and liquid flow rates, fill levels, inlet/outlet configurations, new bubble separation methods, serial and parallel flows, and new plant root types, numbers, and orders.\n\nMost of the PWM equipment shipped to the space station consists of 3-D printed, flight-certified materials. The crew assembles the various system configurations on a workbench in the open cabin of the station and then executes the experiments, including routine communication with the PWM research team on the ground. All the quantitative data is collected via a single high-definition video camera.\n\nThe PWM hardware and procedures are designed to incrementally test the system’s capabilities for hydroponic and ebb and flow, and to repeatedly demonstrate priming, draining, serial/parallel channel operation, passive bubble management, limits of operation, stability during perturbations, start-up, shut-down, and myriad clean plant-insertion, saturation, stable flow, and plant-removal steps.\n\nThe recent results of the PWM-5 and -6 technology demonstrations aboard the space station have significantly advanced the technology used for passive plant watering in space. These quantitative demonstrations established hydroponic and ebb and flow watering processes as functions of serial and parallel channel fill levels, various types of engineered plant root models, and pump flow rates—including single-phase liquid flows and gas-liquid two-phase flows.\n\nCritical PWM plumbing elements perform the role of passive gas-liquid separation (i.e., the elimination of bubbles from liquid and vice versa), which routinely occurs on Earth due to gravitational effects. The PWM-5 and -6 hardware in effect replaces the passive role of gravity with the passive roles of surface tension, wetting, and system geometry. In doing so, highly reliable “no-moving-parts” plumbing devices act to restore the illusive sense of up and down in space. For example,\n\nThe demonstrated successes of PWM-5 and -6 offer a variety of ready plug-and-play solutions for effective plant watering in low- and variable-gravity environments, despite the challenging wetting properties of the water-based nutrient solutions used to water plants. Though a variety of root models are demonstrated by PWM-5 and -6, the remaining unknown is the role that real growing plants will play in such systems. Acquiring such knowledge may only be a matter of time.\n\nProject Lead:Dr. Mark Weislogel, IRPI LLC\n\nSponsoring Organization:Biological and Physical Sciences Division\n\nCuriosity and the desire to explore are traits deeply rooted in human nature.

ASGSR stands at the forefront for fostering groundbreaking research and highlighting the cutting-edge science happening now using microgravity, low-gravity, radiation, and other space-based stressors.\n\nThe meeting, held in Washington, D.C., November 14-18, 2023, featured a variety of general and technical sessions, student fireside chats, and working sessions exploring the conference’s theme:The Future of Space Exploration: Challenges and Opportunities.\n\nDr. Lisa Carnell, NASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences' (BPS) Division Director, opened the conference with her keynote presentation on the state of BPS. Carnell shared that if the U.S. wants to maintain science leadership, with the intent to go farther and stay longer in space, we must continue to pioneer transformative science at the frontiers of biology and physical sciences. Carnell encouraged attendees to look ahead for ways to support the technologies and infrastructure that will be needed to carry out this science.\n\nFormer astronaut Dr. Bonnie Dunbar echoed Carnell’s remarks as she expressed the need for adequate funding of this scientific and space-based research as a critical path needed for sustainable exploration. Dunbar challenged the group to build upon the pioneering work of BPS to inspire the next generation of space scientists, engineers, and astronauts.\n\nASGSR hosted over 300 presentations where speakers and participants shared their latest findings and discussed the future of space exploration, a few highlighted topics follow:\n\nNext year’s ASGSR conference will be held in Puerto Rico, December 3-7, 2024.", "ocr_text": "", "media_assets": ["https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/NASA_logo.png?w=300", "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/fullsizerender.jpg?w=2048", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/jsc2023e006587.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/esd/articles/2025/A90%20NASA%20Chesapeake%20Shawn%20Serbin.jpeg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/psd/solar-system/skywatching/2025/october/02_Jupiter%20and%20Saturn_Credit_Preston%20Dyches_CC%20BY-NC%202.0.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/gsfc-20171208-archive-e000760orig-stpatricksaurora-iotd.jpg?w=1024", "https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/AFRC2025-0013-02/AFRC2025-0013-02~large.jpg?w=1919&h=1536&fit=clip&crop=faces%2Cfocalpoint", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/uc-s03-working-file-horizontal-v02-2.png?w=1024", "https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/ARC-1969-A-16712/ARC-1969-A-16712~large.jpg?w=1920&h=1382&fit=clip&crop=faces%2Cfocalpoint", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/astro/exo-explore/exoplanet-artists-concepts/WISPIT%202%20b%20Wide%20Final.png?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/afrc2025-0030-83.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/1-pia26662-dsc4667-enhanced-nr.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/cds/general/images/2023/09/exoplanetwatch-896.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/missions/hubble/galaxies/spiral/Hubble_NGC2775_potw2538a.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/img-3738.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/esd/articles/2025/hydroflame_banner.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/20240131-207a0543.png?w=1024", "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/themes/nasa-child/assets/images/nasa-logo@2x.png", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/iss070e001252.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/acd25-132-006.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/taking-in-the-view-surface-from-hls.png?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/esd/eo/content-feature/aerosols/images/aerosol_fine_fraction_depth_201008_hammer.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/content/dam/science/astro/programs/physics-of-the-cosmos/images/gwsig/gravitational_waves-16.gif", "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/fullsizerender.jpg", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/psd/photojournal/pia/pia13/pia13126/PIA13126.tif?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/cds/general/images/2023/03/53636962950-44cdcf9882-o.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/astro/programs/exep/images/exo.png?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/missions/webb/science/2025/09/STScI-01K6196E18EPYF8RDEAQVA01Y3.png?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/cds/learn/science-activation-stories/2025/2025-0805-RiversofStarsandStories-30-moonactivity-sm-Brandi_Stewart.jpg?w=1024", "https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/missions/prism/prism-data-cube.png?w=1024"], "referenced_urls": [], "provenance": {"parser_path": "external.news", "fetched_at": "2025-10-04T03:42:02.800759", "source_type": "html"}}, "grounded_entities": [{"text": "microgravity", "entity_type": "exposure", "id": "CUSTOM:EXPOSURE:MICROGRAVITY", "label": "microgravity", "source_obo": "CUSTOM", "confidence": 1.0, "spans": [[301, 313]]}, {"text": "radiation", "entity_type": "exposure", "id": "CUSTOM:EXPOSURE:RADIATION", "label": "radiation", "source_obo": "CUSTOM", "confidence": 1.0, "spans": [[817, 826]]}, {"text": "year", "entity_type": "duration", "id": "CUSTOM:DURATION:LONG_DURATION", "label": "long duration", "source_obo": "CUSTOM", "confidence": 1.0, "spans": [[2189, 2193]]}], "referenced_ids": {"pmcid": [], "doi": [], "osdr_id": [], "taskbook_id": []}}

In-depth characterization is a critical next step in the evolution of these technologies is, particularly when considering acute versus chronic exposures.\n\nThis effort, sponsored by NASA’s Space Biology Program, reflects a collaboration between NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, NASA’s Human Research Program, NIH’s National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), the NIH National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), the NIH National Cancer Institute (NCI), BARDA, and the FDA. The agencies selected projects that will adapt existing 3D tissues and microphysiological systems (MPS) — also known as “tissue chips” or “organs-on-chips” — to 1) expand tissue viability and robust function for a minimum of 6 months, and 2) fully test and validate these models for acute and chronic stressors.\n\nThe selected studies aim to fund the development and validation of tissue chips which can function successfully for 6 months or longer in an automated fashion, to be used for modeling of acute and/or chronic exposures (e.g., to drugs and other compounds, radiation, environmental hazards, infection, microgravity exposure, etc.).\n\nEight investigators will conduct these investigations from eight institutions in six states. When fully implemented, approximately $16M will be awarded in fiscal years 2022-2025.\n\nElizabeth Blaber, Rensselaer Polytechnic InstituteUnderstanding the Brain-Liver-Gut Axis during Spaceflight and Aging\n\nJoel Blanchard, ICAHN School of Medicine at Mount Sinai,Identification of Biomarkers and Pathological Mechanisms via Longitudinal Analysis of Neurological and Cerebrovascular Responses to Neurotoxic Stress Using a Multi-cellular Integrated Model of the Human Brain\n\nGuohao Dai, Northeastern University,Bioengineer Long-lasting 3D Neurovascular Microphysiological System to Model Chronic Inflammation-mediated Neurodegeneration\n\nAbhishek Jain, Texas A&M,Long-term Patient iPSC Vessel Chip Model to Assess Stressors of Atherosclerosis and mRNA Therapeutics\n\nChristopher Porada, Wake Forest University,Long-lived Single- and Multi-organ Tissue Equivalent (OTE) Platforms to Model the Response of Human Tissues to Various Stressors\n\nGordana Vunjak-Novakovic, Columbia University,MORPH: Multi-Organ Repair Post Hypoxia\n\nJoseph Wu, Stanford University,Assessing Long-Term Effects of Radiation Exposure in Engineered Heart & Vascular Tissues\n\nCatherine Yeung, University of Washington,Extended Culture of Kidney MPS and Organoids to Model Acute and Chronic Exposure to Drugs and Environmental Toxins\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n'Chipping’ Away at Personalized Medicine\n\nCuriosity and the desire to explore are traits deeply rooted in human nature.

For ten years, SEES has united high-performing 11th and 12th grade students from diverse backgrounds across the country to conduct research in space systems, planetary science, remote sensing, emergency response, and aerospace design.\n\nIn summer 2025, 174 students were selected through a competitive national application process and placed into small, mission-focused research teams. These teams explored topics in aerospace engineering, in-space systems, planetary exploration, and Earth observation. The program began with a virtual research phase and continued with a two-week residency for 82 students at the Center for Space Research, while 92 students participated virtually. Interns collaborated closely with NASA scientists, academic researchers, and industry mentors. Projects were presented at a national scientific symposium and will be shared at the 2025 American Geophysical Union (AGU) conference.\n\nInterns worked in small, mission-aligned teams focused on space science, engineering, and remote sensing. Projects combined advanced technical analysis with creative design, resulting in a range of prototype systems and data-driven outcomes.\n\nHighlighted projects included:\n\nWith 20 teams in all, additional projects expanded research in Earth observations, using satellite imagery, radar, and astronaut photography to monitor floods, wildfires, air quality, and surface deformation. Other teams advanced astrophysics and planetary science by analyzing stellar clusters, exoplanet transits, and deep-space features with NASA datasets.\n\nOne of the team members, a rising senior from Brownsville, TX, reflected on his journey:\n\n“Three months ago, I had no real-world experience with engineering, and no real research done outside of my classes. But three months ago, I was accepted into the NASA SEES internship. Being a NASA SEES intern has transformed my life in ways I never imagined possible so early on.”\n\nSEES teams also participated in a microgravity research track. Using the ZQube, a compact research platform with an integrated camera, sensor stack, and payload compartment, teams designed experiments for flight aboard a parabolic aircraft. The ZQube was developed by Twiggs Space Lab and Space for Teachers in collaboration with SEES, giving interns a direct role in shaping the technology they used. During the onsite phase, interns conducted drop tests to test and refine their payloads. The experiments are scheduled to fly in Spring 2026, with imagery and sensor data returned to student teams for analysis.\n\nThe SEES program is a nationally recognized model for developing a diverse and technically skilled aerospace workforce. By applying NASA data to real-world problems, SEES equips students with early access to tools, training, and research practices used across the aerospace sector. The program builds data-literate problem solvers prepared for innovation and long-term contributions to science and technology.\n\nFor more information, visit:https://www.csr.utexas.edu/sees-internship/.\n\nThe NASA SEES project is supported by NASA under cooperative agreement award number NNH15ZDA004C and is part of NASA's Science Activation Portfolio.

A: Omni-Gravitational Hydroponics", "summary": "Plant Water Management (PWM)", "published_at": "2021-09-28T05:15:00-04:00", "authors": ["NASA Science Editorial Team"], "tags": ["Science &amp; Research", "Science-enabling Technology", "Biological & Physical Sciences", "Technology Highlights", "Biological &amp; Physical Sciences"], "body_text": "3 min read\n\nPlant Water Management (PWM)\n\nNASA is demonstrating that even without the help of gravity, hydroponic plant watering methods can enable plant habitats aboard crewed or robotic space missions.\n\nOn Earth, plants draw water upwards through the roots against gravity, via capillary action, which orients the plant and enables display of its canopy (foliage and branches) for optimal photosynthesis and transpiration. The plant grows above the nutrient-rich soil as the water recedes into the soil, and oxygen from the air between the soil particles diffuses into root hair, maintaining a balance of oxygenation in the water and a dry stem. Hydroponic watering systems on Earth achieve a similar result without the soil by providing a continuous flow of aerated nutrient-rich water, which allows the plant to take up only what it needs; gravity again assures growth direction and a dry stem. Providing water to plants at the varied rates they require is difficult without gravity—which is exactly what is required of plant watering systems aboard spacecraft. Of the many methods pursued by NASA, hydroponics offers key performance advantages: low system mass, natural aeration, simplicity, and potential for automation. But how can hydroponics channels work in space without gravity to define an “up” or “down” or a “top” or “bottom?”.\n\nNASA has initiated a series of experiments to test capillary hydroponics onboard the International Space Station (ISS). These Plant Water Management (PWM) experiments seek to exploit the combined effects of surface tension, wetting, and hydroponic channel geometry to ensure proper water flow in space to mimic the role of gravity on Earth. Terrestrial hydroponic systems work so well, are so simple, have few failure modes, and require no media such as soil. But can we design a system in space that can replicate such characteristics? Specifically, how can we assure that the nutrient-rich water will flow safely along the “bottom” of hydroponics channels in a low-gravity environment?\n\nThe PWM hardware consists of a variable-speed metering pump, tubing, assorted valves, syringes, and several sets of capillary fluidic hydroponics channels and tubing harnesses. This setup enables a wide range of parameters to be tested—e.g., gas and liquid flow rates, fill levels, inlet/outlet configurations, bubble separation methods, and plant types, number, and order. Most of the equipment shipped to the ISS consists of 3-D printed flight-certified materials. The crew assembles the various system configurations on a workbench in the open cabin of the ISS and then executes the experiments, including routine communication with the PWM research team on the ground. All of the quantitative data is collected via a single high-definition video camera.\n\nThe PWM hardware and procedures are designed to incrementally test the system’s capabilities including priming, single-channel operation, parallel-channel operation, reverse flow, serial flow, limits of operation, stability during perturbations, start-up, shut-down, and myriad plant-insertion, saturation, stable flow, and plant-removal steps.\n\nWith each successful demonstration, the low-gravity hydroponics plumbing approach increases its Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and will eventually be used in demonstrations with actual plants, which will hopefully be performed in connection with plant habitats already on ISS (i.e., theAdvanced Plant Habitat).PWM experimentscurrently underway on ISS focus on passive liquid delivery, fill level maintenance, serial operation, passive steady aeration, and more. Designs are in work for follow-on demonstrations targeting specific crop types, automation methods, and channel deployment architecture.\n\nDr. Mark Weislogel, Portland State University\n\nBiological and Physical Sciences Division\n\nA NASA-sponsored team at the University of Iowa (UI) is restoring and advancing the nation’s…\n\nWebb is the premier observatory of the next decade, serving thousands of astronomers worldwide.

But microgravity does present challenges and affects Space Station plants’ ability to receive adequate hydration and nutrition. The Plant Water Management-5 and 6 (PWM-5 and 6) investigation uses the physical properties of fluids, such as surface tension and wetting, as a mechanism to provide hydration and aeration for plants. Results could advance understanding of the physical aspects of fluid flow and inform designs of fluid delivery systems for reduced gravity environments.\n\nPlant Habitat-06investigates whether the spaceflight environment affects the ability of tomato plants to defend themselves against disease-causing microorganisms. The study will investigate whether a hormone called salicylic acid is involved in processes that regulate plant immune system function in microgravity. Results could support the development of strategies to minimize crop loss and low produce quality in future space agricultural settings caused by harmful microbes.\n\nExtended missions to the Moon and Mars require a critical understanding on the impact of spaceflight to reproductive health for female astronauts. Throughout the course of three shuttle missions, alterations in ovarian function were detected in female mice that could potentially lead to fertility issues. This latest mission to the International Space Station (RR-20) will further probe whether space-flown female mice have temporary or permanent alterations to their reproductive capability and whether dysfunctional hormone signaling is linked with bone loss.\n\nPolymicrobial Biofilm Growth and Control during Spaceflight,Bacterial Adhesion and Corrosion(BAC) is a joint space biology and physical sciences payload that explores conditions of multi-species biofilms in microgravity.

Accessing resonant interactions among these gases will allow scientists to explore few-body physics, quantum chemistry, and fundamental physics in novel energy regimes—without the perturbing force of gravity, since these experiments will be conducted on the International Space Station.\n\nUltracold atomic gases provide a unique tool for exploring the quantum nature of matter and for probing the foundations of modern physics. Researchers with NASA’s Cold Atom Lab (CAL) have now simultaneously produced gases of two atomic species (rubidium and potassium) in a uniquely quantum (wave-like) phase of matter called a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) for the first time in space. CAL scientists are using the unique microgravity environment onboard the International Space Station to study interactions, molecule formation, and the emergence of structure and complexity in these coexisting dual-species gases at unprecedented low temperatures, for long times in free fall, and specifically in the absence of the perturbing force of gravity.\n\nThe experimental realization of an exotic fifth state of matter exhibiting macroscopic quantum behaviors ignited the modern-day use of ultracold atoms as the workhorse of experimental quantum physics. This so-called Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) was first reported in 1995 by the team of Eric Cornell and Carl Wieman at the Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics (JILA), who jointly shared the Nobel prize with Wolfgang Ketterle from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2001 for this discovery.  The JILA team created a BEC by cooling a gas of rubidium atoms to within a few hundred nanoKelvins, which is a small fraction of a degree above absolute zero, and observing the phase transition from thermal to quantum matter as a high-density peak building up in the center of the gas.\n\nBuilding on this discovery, scientists have made numerous useful discoveries and scientific advancements ranging from studies of swirling vortices and superfluid behaviors, to capitalizing on the direct observation of the wave-like nature of matter, to the development of ultra-precise quantum sensors and atomic clocks. Advancements in this field have grown rapidly, thanks in large part to the diversity of additional atomic species that can be cooled to form a BEC. Notably, the ability to simultaneously produce and co-locate quantum gases of different atomic species enabled the ability to explore resonantly interacting gases and the growth of complexity at a fundamental level.\n\nThe Cold Atom Lab launched to the International Space Station in May 2018, and has been operating since that time as the world’s first multi-user facility for the study of ultra-cold atoms in space. For the first three years of operation, an international group of CAL scientists produced and explored BECs on a daily basis in the unique microgravity environment of the space station to demonstrate novel techniques to cool and control quantum gases, to explore the physics of ultracold gases in bubble geometries, to measure the dynamics of quantum gases over 1 second of free-fall, and to demonstrate matter-wave interference, all using a single atomic species – rubidium-87.\n\nCAL has now simultaneously produced BECs of two atomic species (rubidium and potassium) for the first time in space (see Figure 2). This effort was enabled by an on-orbit repair and replacement of a critical microwave frequency driver by astronaut Megan McArthur in 2021, which allowed potassium to be produced at ultracold temperatures in CAL. Since this successful repair, CAL scientists have been concentrating on methods to simultaneously cool the gases to the BEC state.  The dual-species BEC was achieved through “sympathetic cooling” of potassium via thermal contact with a directly evaporated ultracold rubidium gas. Using this technique, mixtures of either rubidium-87 and potassium-39 or rubidium-87 and potassium-41 can be regularly produced for study in the flight instrument.\n\n\"CAL’s recent success in making ultracold potassium clouds available for experimentation is a great leap forward,” said Washington State University Professor Peter Engels, a CAL Co-Principal Investigator for few-body physics studies onboard the International Space Station. “Potassium atoms provide us with the opportunity to change the interactions between the atoms at will. CAL’s recent achievement will open up many new opportunities for research with CAL, from fundamental studies of few-body physics to demonstrations of quantum device concepts and developing strategies for future missions.”\n\nCAL is now the first and only quantum gas experiment in space with multiple atomic species available for study. By broadening the spectrum of quantum gases produced in space, experiments are now planned to create ultracold molecules, exotic states of matter, and enable high-precision tests of Einstein’s equivalence principle with quantum matter.\n\n“The possibilities are outstanding,” said University of Rochester Professor Nicholas Bigelow, who is a CAL Principal Investigator studying dual-species atom interferometry in orbit. “We can now move to tests of some of the most fundamental ideas of physics while also taking steps toward realizing sophisticated new quantum technologies for navigation and planetary exploration including studies of our own planet, Earth.”\n\nThis research was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

NASA is capitalizing on this by growing the nation’s next generation of scientists while they are rising juniors and seniors. GeneLab for High Schools, or GL4HS, is an intensive four-week program, sponsored by NASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences Division and managed by the agency’s Ames Research Center.\n\nWhere else in the world would students have the opportunity to learn about such topics as space biology omics-based research, bioinformatics, computational biology methods, and team experiments, while acquiring advanced proposal writing and oral presentation skills, all taught by university professors, industry experts, and past and present astronauts?\n\n“This is a competitive program,” notes Dr. Sigrid Reinsch, the director of education and outreach for NASA’s Space Biology Program at Ames. “GL4HS is a great opportunity for students of various backgrounds to learn about space biology and engage with their peers across the country. Students are chosen based on their academic records, reference letters, and their personal statements. We want them to tell us why they want to enroll, why they’re interested in advanced space biology, and how the program may contribute to their career goals, as opposed to someone who’s just seeking to get another notch on their college application.”\n\nOnce enrolled, students form teams and pick topics to study and present. The whimsy of their team names belies the heady biology they’ll present at the end of the course. Some examples from the 2020 Class:\n\nTeamthe Migh-T Cells:The Effects of Spaceflight-induced Oxidative Stress on Apoptotic Pathways and Aging in the Murine Thymus;\n\nTeam Epic-Dermis:Microgravity Effects on Dermal Thickness: An Investigation into Collagen Thickness;\n\nTeamthe Bronchial Bros:Blood Clots in the Lung: The Role of Spaceflight in Altering Vascular Tone and Increasing Risk of Thrombosis;\n\nTeam Liveration:The Role of Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Kinase 4 (Pdk4) in Liver Lipotoxic and Repair Pathways during Spaceflight; and,\n\nTeamthe Gutsy Girls:The Effects of Spaceflight on Innate Immunity of the Gut: The Role of Angiopoietin-4\n\nThe program’s lead instructor is Dr. Elizabeth Blaber of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, who founded the program as a post-doctoral fellow at Ames. One of her observations is what her students say they get out of the program: “Yes, they learn a lot of content, a lot of biology, but what they really rave about is the people they get to meet. All the different scientists, the astronauts, all of them with different backgrounds, and all of them willing to share their experiences with the students. It’s almost like a networking opportunity for their future careers.”\n\nWhen GeneLab for High Schools began, it was an in-person program whose enrollment was confined primarily to students in the San Francisco Bay Area – those who could commute to Ames on a daily basis. The pandemic changed that, and the 2020 program was held virtually. The silver lining was the program could become more inclusive. In fact, last year’s class was composed of 15 students from diverse backgrounds in five states: California, Illinois, Colorado, Virginia and Texas. In addition, four biology instructors were selected to attend the program and learn how course components could be implemented in their classrooms. The program will continue to be virtual for 2021, and only a computer and internet access is needed for students and teachers to participate.\n\nSamrawit Gebre is the deputy project manager for the GeneLab Data System at NASA. She sums up the experience students get from the program this way: “It’s fun. It’s hard. You get to network with astronauts. You learn presentation skills you’ll use for the rest of your life. And you’re taught by some of the most amazing teachers in the country. When I explain the program to other scientists, the most common response I get is: ‘I wish this program had been around when I was in high school.’ That says a lot.”\n\nStudent applications to the 2021 GeneLab program this summer will be accepted until March 1, 2021, and can be found here:https://gl4hsapp.com.\n\nTeacher-intern applications will be accepted until March 15, 2021 and instructions are here:arc-gl4hs@mail.nasa.gov.\n\nThe GeneLab for High Schools program is proudly supported by NASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences (BPS) Division as part of its mission to pioneer scientific discovery and enable exploration.

As a new division of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate (SMD), BPS now rubs elbows with NASA missions pushing the frontiers of knowledge that includes spacecraft and telescopes exploring our planet and our solar system and peering beyond.\n\nBPS’s move from NASA’s Human Exploration Organization Directorate to SMD in July 2020 integrates the agency’s scientific work in these areas and advances practical applications toward future missions. Formerly known as the Space Life and Physical Sciences Research and Applications (SLPSRA) Division, the newly created BPS Division will continue to serve its mission of pioneering scientific discovery and enabling human spaceflight exploration.\n\n“As experimentalists, we use aspects of the spaceflight environment to study biological and physical systems,” said Craig Kundrot, BPS director. “Studying how these systems respond to gravity and radiation, among other factors, can lead to scientific discoveries that might one day help enable prolonged space exploration and eventually benefit life on Earth.”\n\nBPS research uses the extreme conditions of space -- such as weightlessness and high doses of radiation — to study a wide spectrum of systems. The variety of the Space Biology program’s studies, for instance, range from growing plants on the International Space Station to examining how the station’s microbiomes change over time. The Physical Sciences program supports cutting edge research like cooling atoms to ultracold temperatures or researching ways to improve fuel efficiency and reduce pollution.\n\nThe division’s role in these endeavors are multifold: offering funding opportunities, providing researchers with access to a variety of “stepping-stone” experimentation platforms that lead to spaceflight experiments, providing programmatic and technological support, and sharing findings with the scientific community at large. “With our next Decadal Survey around the corner and the engagement of our research community,” Kundrot said, “we look forward to continuing to pioneer new discoveries that will help shape the work of future generations of scientists.”\n\n“Discoveries in one discipline can inform others and generate entirely new questions,” said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate. “Science and human exploration are working hand in hand as never before, and we welcome our biological and physical sciences colleagues to the team. Adding new perspective to our work will further our shared scientific understanding of the universe and safeguard and improve life on Earth and in space.”\n\nWhether you know it or not, quantum science touches our lives each day. Quantum mechanics refers to the branch of physics that focuses on the behaviors of atoms and subatomic particles, and it is a foundational part of many components in many modern technologies, including cell phones and computers, that employ the wave nature of electrons in silicon.\n\nOne example of quantum research supported by BPS is the Cold Atom Lab (CAL), the world’s first multi-user facility for the study of ultra-cold atoms in space. A “mini-lab” in space, CAL gives researchers a suite of tools to cool, tune and probe ultra-cold atoms. In low gravity, cold atom clouds essentially “free float” inside a high vacuum chamber. Under these conditions it is possible to reach lower temperatures and to create experiments not possible on Earth.\n\nAs atoms get colder, they move more slowly and become effectively larger. Ultracold atom facilities like CAL cool atoms down below a billionth of a degree above absolute zero, the temperature at which they would theoretically almost stop moving entirely. At these low temperatures, the atoms can form unique quantum states of matter.\n\nDevelopment of quantum science and technology is still at the discovery stage. Physicists are just beginning to build practical quantum computers, and experiments with the quantum properties of matter have only been possible at all because of research technologies developed in the last 20 years.\n\nNASA is currently partnering with outstanding physicists from around the world to advance quantum science through space-based research. This research could enable new opportunities on a ten-year horizon, possibly including: the development of quantum processors which may enable limited computing applications; new sensors for biotechnology and defense; next-generation positioning, navigation, and timing systems for military and commercial applications; new approaches to understanding materials, chemistry, and even gravity through quantum information theory; novel algorithms for machine learning and optimization; and transformative cyber security systems including quantum-resistant cryptography in response to developments in quantum information science.\n\nThe effects of the spaceflight environment on viral and microbial pathogen dynamics are largely unknown and represent both a significant gap in our knowledge and an important opportunity to study the presence of microbial populations and predict health risks during long-term space exploration.\n\nBPS’s space biology research advances knowledge of microbial communities of a built, closed-system environment and how this environment interacts with the astronauts. A three-year study involving four U.S. and international crew volunteers is currently underway in which scientists are studying how the microbial ecosystem changes over time. Eight different surface locations are sampled on the Station, including the dining table, waste and hygiene compartment, crew quarters, and others. By studying how the microbiome changes over time, researchers will be better prepared to put systems in place that ensure the health and safety of our astronauts as they embark on prolonged missions in space.\n\nBPS’s Space Biology program is sponsoring two other investigations that will conduct deeper analyses of the microbiology of the built environment and microbial interaction dynamics and additional investigations will be selected through future competitive solicitations. These studies of ISS microbial ecosystems lay the foundation for considering how to manage microbial ecosystems as human exploration advances to the Gateway, lunar surface and eventually Mars.\n\nThe Advanced Combustion via Microgravity Experiments (ACME) project is a set of five independent studies using the Space Station to research improved fuel efficiency and reduced pollutant production in practical combustion on Earth, through innovative research focused on materials flammability.\n\nOne such ACME experiments, the Burning Rate Emulator (BRE) experiment, is focused on fire prevention, especially in spacecraft. Specifically, BRE’s objective is to improve our fundamental understanding of materials flammability, such as ignition and extinction behavior, and assess the relevance of existing flammability test methods for low and partial-gravity environments. It is hoped that this technique could be used to predict flammability without conducting the test in low gravity.\n\nAfter completion of this series of experiments on gaseous fuels (which followed an earlier series of experiments on liquid fuels), a series of experiments examining solid fuels will provide critical data for fire safety in human exploration and validate material flammability numerical models.\n\nThe Vegetable Production System, known as Veggie, is a space garden residing on the space station. Veggie helps NASA study plant growth in microgravity while adding fresh food to the astronauts’ diet, which can enhance happiness and well-being on the orbiting laboratory.\n\nThe most current study, Veg-04A, focuses on the impact of light quality and fertilizer on leafy crop growth for a 28-day grow-out, microbial food safety, nutritional value, taste acceptability by the crew, and the overall behavioral health benefits of having plants and fresh food in space.\n\nMizuna mustard, a leafy green crop, was grown for 28 days under two different light quality treatments in space, and the impact on crop growth was analyzed in terms of the differences observed in plant yield, nutritional composition and microbial levels. One goal in these experiments is to grow leafy greens with high harvest index—meaning, most of the plant is edible.\n\nWhat’s next for Veggie? Researchers will be testing the suitability of other plants, especially leafy greens, for crew consumption, and Advanced Plant Habitat (APH) will be growing radish and investigating underlying mechanisms of how plants grow differently in space.\n\nBPS research and technology development is conducted on a wide range ofexperimental platformsincluding theInternational Space Station, ground-based analogs for spaceflight, drop towers and aircraft that provide seconds of weightlessness, to free-flyer satellites.\n\nBPS includes personnel are located at NASA facilities across the country, including NASA headquarters, Ames Research Center, Glenn Research Center, Marshall Space Flight Center, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Johnson Space Center, and Kennedy Space Center.\n\nLearn more about Biological and Physical Sciences researchRead the latest BPS newsVisit the Science Mission Directorate site\n\nWebb is the premier observatory of the next decade, serving thousands of astronomers worldwide.

Mitigating the effects of radiation exposure represents a critical challenge for future spaceflight missions. Thus, understanding the effects the crew and other onboard organisms will experience during spaceflight is a crucial area of research. Numerous experiments have exposed different organisms to a wide range of space radiation environments. However, data on the precise characteristics of the investigation and especially on the radiation exposure experienced is often complex to access and understand, even for experts in the field of radiation biology.\n\nA NASA-sponsored research team at the University of Wisconsin has developed theRad-Bio-App databaseto help all levels of researchers—from experts to interested citizen scientists—explore space biology-related radiation data. Rad-Bio-App is an interactive, relational database that links previously conducted space biology experiments according to the level and type of radiation exposure. It also links experiments sharing other common features such as the organism studied or mission hardware used. Rad-Bio-App enables the user to filter through this web of relationships and easily “drill down” into the results from studies with similar radiation environments or features. This ability to interactively sort and filter allows researchers to significantly extend the insights drawn from existing results and adds value to the considerable investments already made in conducting these experiments.\n\nBut where does the data fueling Rad-Bio-App come from? Regular access to space has allowed researchers to explore how this environment impacts biological systems, including crew, animals, plants, and microbes that accompany them.NASA’s GeneLab data repositoryhas aggregated results from many of these studies, including descriptions of their radiation environments. Our team has capitalized on this resource to develop Rad-Bio-App as a graphical discovery environment. We imported the GeneLab-curated data from missions on the International Space Station, the Space Shuttle, and free-flying satellites such as the Russian Bion and Foton spacecraft. In addition, we added results from a variety of experiments using terrestrial radiation sources such as particle accelerators.\n\nTo help provide context for future missions, we also gathered the radiation exposure data from the Mars Curiosity Rover mission while it traveled to Mars and after it landed on the planet’s surface. For the Moon, we used radiation data from the Apollo astronaut’s radiation monitors, recent robotic explorers, and the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. The Moon and Mars data will enable researchers to place each study in the context of the predicted radiation environment of future missions beyond Low Earth Orbit.\n\nRad-Bio-App allows users to interactively filter experiments according to their radiation exposure and many other elements of the experimental design. Thus, Rad-Bio-App can be used to explore radiation responses determined by previous spaceflight experiments and help put these experiments in the context of radiation exposures likely to be encountered in future exploration missions. For example, this tool was used to identify datasets within the GeneLab data repository where mice had experienced similar radiation doses to those expected during a flight from Earth to Mars. These datasets contained analyses of the patterns of gene expression (see figure a, below). Each individual study provides some insight into possible genetic changes in the spaceflight environment. Moreover, Rad-Bio-App allowed researchers to analyze patterns of altered gene expression across multiple studies selected for their common Earth-to-Mars-like radiation exposure and shared focus on responses in the mouse. Such cross-study analyses identified clusters of genes related to different biological functions that are seen across multiple samples (see figure b). These gene clusters provide targets for further research into how biology might respond to the radiation dosage experienced while traveling from Earth to Mars, and represent new targets for potential countermeasures to mitigate the harmful effects of radiation exposure.\n\nRad-Bio-App provides critical contextual information on radiation that enables researchers to extend the analysis of existing space biology datasets. The database architecture of Rad-Bio-App is designed to continuously incorporate the wealth and diversity of future space biology studies. Thus, this tool should help provide an ever-expanding insight into how life forms are affected by the complex and varied space radiation environment.\n\nDr. Simon Gilroy, University of Wisconsin-Madison\n\nNASA Biological and Physical Sciences Division, NASA Ames, and the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n\nA NASA-sponsored team at the University of Iowa (UI) is restoring and advancing the nation’s…\n\nWebb is the premier observatory of the next decade, serving thousands of astronomers worldwide.

They can be good substitutes for people. They reproduce quickly, so that many generations can be studied in a short time, and their genome has been completely mapped.Drosophilais being used as a genetic model for several human diseases including Parkinson's and Huntington's.\n\nThey're about to become genetic models for astronauts. \"We are sending fruit flies to the International Space Station,\" says Bhattacharya. \"They will orbit Earth alongside astronauts, helping us explore the effects of long-term space flight on human beings.\"\n\nThe flies will be living in a habitat developed at Ames called the \"Fruit Fly Lab.\" Inside, they will lead the hurried lives of fruit flies--living, dying, reproducing, and experiencing the same space radiation and microgravity as their human counterparts.  Cameras will record the behavior and appearance of these miniature astronauts; and at intervals some of them will be frozen and returned to Earth for analysis.\n\nThis research was recommended by the National Research Council itself. In a recent Decadal Survey, the council noted that \"model systems offer increasingly valuable insights into basic biology.\" And they called for \"an organized effort to identify common changes in gene expression [among] key model systems in space.\"\n\n\"The Fruit Fly Lab will allow us to look into a variety of questions such as the effect of space flight on aging, cardiovascular fitness, sleep, stress and much more,\" she says.\n\nVisit the Fruit Fly Lab\n\nexperiment home page\n\nBhattacharya's personal interest is the immune system.  It has long been known that astronauts' ability to resist disease is weakened in space.  Turns out, the same thing happens to fruit flies.  \"We sentDrosophilato Earth orbit onboard Space Shuttle Discovery in 2006, and they all experienced a decrement in immune function,\" says Bhattacharya.\n\nThe shuttle flight was relatively brief, only 13 days, but astronauts traveling to Mars and other distant places will be in space much longer.  A fruit fly habitat permanently installed on the ISS allows researchers to conduct studies directly relevant to such long-duration space flight.\n\nImmune system studies of human astronauts can be tricky because every astronaut has his or her own idiosyncratic genetic code.  \"What's nice about the flies we send up is that they are all genetically identical,\" notes Bhattacharya. \"We can do much better science with such a population.\"\n\nFlies onboard the space station will also have their own \"carnival ride.\" A 1-g centrifuge will subjectDrosophilato the equivalent of Earth-gravity, allowing researchers for the first time to unravel the competing influences of radiation and gravity. \"This is cutting-edge research,\" she says, clearly enthusiastic about this new device.\n\nThe Fruit Fly Lab is scheduled to launch in late summer 2014 onboard a Space-X rocket.\n\nMaybe they should pack some bananas, too.

The geologic record tells us that as glaciers expanded and covered Adélie breeding habitats with ice, penguins in the region abandoned their colonies. When the glaciers melted during warming periods, the Adélie penguins were able to return to their rocky breeding grounds.\n\nNow, a NASA-funded study by University of Delaware scientists and colleagues at other institutions reports that this warming may no longer be beneficial for Adélie penguins. In a paper published June 29 in the journalScientific Reports, the researchers project that approximately 30 percent of current Adélie colonies may be in decline by 2060, and approximately 60 percent of the present population might be dwindling by 2099. They also found the penguins at more southerly sites in Antarctica may be less affected by climate change.\n\nThe study results suggest that changes in climate, particularly sustained periods of warmer than usual sea surface temperatures, are detrimental to Adélie penguins. While the specific mechanisms for this relationship remain unknown the study focuses attention on areas where climate change is likely to create a high frequency of unsuitable conditions during the 21st century.\n\n“It is only in recent decades that we know Adélie penguins population declines are associated with warming, which suggests that many regions of Antarctica have warmed too much and that further warming is no longer positive for the species,” said the paper’s lead author, Megan Cimino, who earned her doctoral degree at University of Delaware in May and is now a postdoctoral scholar at Scripps Institute of Oceanography in La Jolla, California.\n\nThe Adélie penguin is a species that breeds across the entire Antarctic continent. The penguins are experiencing population declines along the West Antarctic Peninsula, which is one of the most rapidly warming places on Earth. Conversely, Adélie populations in other areas of Antarctica where the climate is stable or even cooling remain steady or are increasing.\n\nThe researchers’ objective was to understand the effects of climate change on Antarctic Adélie penguin colonies. The study, funded through the NASA Biodiversity program, used satellite data and global climate model projections to understand current and future population trends on a continental scale. They analyzed satellite observations from 1981 to 2010 of sea ice concentration and bare rock locations, as penguins need ice- and snow-free terrain with pebbles to make their nests. The scientists also took into account data from previous studies that had used satellite imagery to detect the presence or absence of penguin populations. Finally, the team also analyzed sea surface temperature data, which, together with bare rock and sea ice, was used as an indicator of the quality of penguins’ nesting habitats.\n\n“From other studies that used actual ground counts — people going and physically counting penguins — and from high-resolution satellite imagery, we have global estimates of Adélie penguin breeding locations, meaning where they are present and where they are absent, throughout the entire Southern Ocean. We also have estimates of population size and how their populations have changed over last few decades,” said Cimino. “We used all these data to run habitat suitability models.”\n\n“When we combined this data with satellite information and future climate projections of sea surface temperature and sea ice, we can look at past and future changes in Adélie penguin habitat suitability,” Cimino said. \"Satellite data allowed me to look at all Adélie penguin habitats throughout the entire Southern Ocean and over multiple decades, which otherwise would not be possible using data solely collected on land or by ship.\"\n\nBy analyzing past satellite observations, the researchers examined the number of years from 1981 to 2010 that had novel or unusual climate — when sea surface or ice temperatures deviated from average — during the Adélie penguin chick-rearing period and then used an ensemble of global climate models to make predictions about Adélie penguin habitat suitability from 2011 to 2099. The team validated the models with documented population trends.\n\nAccording to Cimino, the southern regions of the West Antarctic Peninsula, associated islands and northern regions of the Peninsula, which are already experiencing population declines, are projected to experience the greatest frequency of unusual climate this century due to warm sea surface temperatures. This suggests that warm sea surface temperatures may cause a decrease in the suitability of chick-rearing habitats at northerly latitudes.\n\n“Penguin colonies near Palmer Station on the West Antarctic Peninsula have declined by at least 80 percent since the 1970s,” Cimino said. “Within this region we saw the most novel climate years compared to the rest of the continent. This means the most years with warmer than normal sea surface temperature. These two things seem to be happening in the West Antarctic Peninsula at a higher rate than in other areas during the same time period.”\n\nBy contrast, the study also suggests several refugia — areas of relatively unaltered climate — may exist in continental Antarctica beyond 2099, which would buffer a species-wide decline. Understanding how these refugia operate is critical to understanding the future of this species.\n\n“The Cape Adare region of the Ross Sea is home to the earliest known penguin occupation and has the largest known Adélie penguin rookery in the world,” Cimino said. “Though the climate there is expected to warm a bit, it looks like it could be a refugia in the future, and if you look back over geologic time it was likely a refuge in the past,”\n\nThe researchers reported that climate change impacts on penguins in the Antarctic will likely be highly site-specific based on regional climate trends, and that a southward contraction in the range of Adélie penguins is likely over the next century.\n\n“Studies like this are important because they focus our attention on areas where a species is most vulnerable to change,” concluded Cimino. “The results can have implications for other species that live in the area and for other ecosystem processes.”\n\nExplore Earth Science\n\nNASA's

But Vermont? Puerto Rico? Kansas? Not likely – unless they’re familiar with a little-known, but invaluable, program called EPSCoR – the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research.\n\nEPSCoR was created in 1993 to strengthen the research capability in U.S. states and territories that had not previously participated equably in competitive aerospace research activities. In short order, the program formed partnerships with local governments, higher education, and industry to improve and enhance research and development while also providing NASA a larger pool of scientists and researchers with whom to develop new technologies to benefit its space missions and people on Earth.\n\n“We offer four types of research awards that range from a one- to three-year period of performance, and from $100,000 to $750,000 in funding,” said Jeppie Compton, the project manager for NASA EPSCoR. “These small grants are a good introduction to working on projects specific to NASA’s investigational needs and serve as a gateway to begin a long-term working relationship with us.”\n\nTeaming with EPSCoR on the Rapid Response Research program, NASA’s Division of Space Life and Physical Sciences Research and Applications (SLPSRA) provided research topic areas that resulted in five awards across the country – from Charleston, South Carolina, to Wichita, Kansas.\n\n“We’re working hand-in-hand with the EPSCoR program to help us find new scientists who can conduct the research we need to help us pioneer new scientific discoveries,” said Diane Malarik, deputy director of SLPSRA. “The ability to work with NASA is not limited to a few states or a handful of academic institutions. NASA touches the nation’s entire scientific community, and SLPSRA is enthusiastic in working with the expertise available within all EPSCoR jurisdictions.”\n\nA look at the recent awardees illustrates the wide variety of science being conducted around the country:\n\nUniversity of Puerto Rico, San Juan\n\nMuscle atrophy is the wasting of muscle tissue that occurs due to aging, genetics, degenerative diseases and injuries. Without mitigation, this condition is common among astronauts exposed to microgravity. Understanding the effects of novel therapies to treat muscle atrophy in mice is essential to providing similar treatments to astronauts, as well as patients affected by this condition on Earth. This project also will provide internship opportunities for Hispanic students in NASA labs, shaping a more diverse STEM workforce for the future.\n\nCollege of Charleston, South Carolina\n\nUltrahigh-performance, long, and lightweight heat pipes are critical to future space missions (e.g., human missions to Mars) and, hence, highly desired. In this proposal, condensation sections of heat pipes will be coated with Ni-graphene. Moreover, various wicking structures will be designed to eventually realize rapid droplet removal in a microgravity environment. The gap between the Ni-graphene coated wall and wicking structures will play a critical role in maximizing heat pipe performances. Heat pipes with various wicking structure designs and gaps will be evaluated before, during and after in- drop tower experiments.\n\nUniversity of Vermont, Burlington\n\nAll human habitation in space will take place in a non-sterile environment, and the multispecies bacterial biofilms in the drinking water are an important source of bacteria to which all astronauts are exposed. This constant exposure to potential bacterial pathogens and the additional roles of biofilms in material corrosion and chemical processes make it imperative that we improve both our understanding of these co-habitants on our space-going vessels, as well as the impact of simulated microgravity on mixed microbial biofilms and community interactions.\n\nWichita State University, Kansas\n\nIn Space Biology there is very little research on space environment-specific molecular networks. The goal of this research is to develop an approach for reconstructing, inferring and analyzing spaceflight molecular networks using data from the NASA GeneLab data system. The broader impacts include advances in understanding of key biological mechanisms that enable biological organisms to thrive in space environments; and training of graduate students in bioinformatic data analysis.\n\nUniversity of Alabama, Huntsville\n\nThe long-term goals of this research are to develop a comprehensive understanding of dust particle transport over a broad range of experimental conditions that can lead to scaled studies of charged dust transport in environments relevant to lunar and Martian conditions. From these studies, it will be possible to provide a scientific basis for the next generation of remote and human missions on airless and plasma-exposed bodies throughout the solar system.\n\nThe following states and territories are eligible to submit a proposal in response to a NASA EPSCoR solicitation: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Delaware, Guam, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, U.S. Virgin Islands, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wyoming.\n\nEPSCoR Cooperative Agreement Notices (proposal requests) are available at:\n\nhttps://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary!init.do?solId={9CB89F2B-D428-3C7B-A97F-2348F2377E5A}&path=open\n\nStay informed on other exciting SLPSRA research initiatives at:\n\nhttps://science.nasa.gov/biological-physical\n\nWebb is the premier observatory of the next decade, serving thousands of astronomers worldwide.

In the near term, plants will provide a means to supplement crew diet through the production of salad crops as a source of fresh food. For example, Sierra Space is developing theAstro Gardenlarge-scale vegetable production system as a concept to produce sufficient garden vegetables for a crew of four. The eXposed Root On-Orbit Test System (XROOTS) investigation is designed to test critical aspects of the Astro Garden system by using hydroponic and aeroponic techniques to grow crop plants without soil, making large scale plant production in space feasible.\n\nCurrent space-based plant systems are small and use particulate-media-based water and nutrient delivery systems. These systems do not scale well in a space environment due to mass, containment, maintenance, and sanitation issues. To grow sufficient crops to provide fresh food to crews in space vehicles or habitats it is necessary to develop a water and nutrient delivery system that can be scaled for large volume plant production. Hydroponic and aeroponic techniques could provide a vital alternative to enable plant systems of sufficient size to contribute to future space exploration.\n\nOn Earth, these soilless technologies can sustain high productivity rates in commercial settings, provide a degree of configuration flexibility, and are relatively simple to maintain. To be effective in the space environment, however, these systems need to be adapted to operate in microgravity while maintaining the ability to provide sufficient water and nutrients to support crop growth, maintain good aeration in the root zone, and accommodate a variety of plant types including leafy green, fruiting (e.g., tomato), and root (e.g., carrot) crops. Important characteristics for operating in the space environment include low mass, power, volume, and crew-time requirements, coupled with high reliability, cleanability, and maintainability.\n\nThe objective of the XROOTS Technology Demonstration is to evaluate soilless nutrient delivery and recovery techniques over the course of plant growth in the microgravity environment of the space station. XROOTS will be integrated with one of theVeggie plant growth unitscurrently being used aboard the space station. Following launch, the base plate and bellows will be removed from the Veggie Facility and the XROOTS module will be mounted below Veggie, and data and power connections established. Veggie will provide lighting and air exchange between the Veggie growing volume containing XROOTS and the space station cabin. After a thorough checkout of the XROOTS system, seed cartridges will be placed in the XROOTS chambers, the nutrient solution will be mixed and placed in the XROOTS reservoir, and the XROOTS module will be powered up and initiated to begin testing.\n\nOperations are planned to occur over the course of six months, with individual tests lasting between 14 and 60 days. XROOTS is designed to observe variables such as nutrient solution spray, flow, and ebb behavior in different capillary configurations and with different operating protocols. XROOTS uses still images and video to observe root development and the interaction of fluid with roots at different growth stages. Data will also be collected using sensors and short periods of crew observation. The XROOTS payload will support testing of two root module configurations, three root/shoot interface designs, and multiple operating protocols (for fluid delivery and recovery). Tests will be conducted with multiple crop species, some through the germination stage and others to full harvest stage.\n\nThe Sierra Space XROOTS team has successfully brought the XROOTS from concept to flight hardware completion. Initial efforts included design of special capillary configurations for controlling water movement in the XROOTS root modules, and preliminary testing of these concepts on a parabolic flight aircraft. The team then completed the XROOTS system design and software architecture, and developed a high-fidelity ground unit for preliminary testing. The flight unit was then fabricated and the XROOTS team is currently working to complete final test and checkout of the system prior to turnover to NASA for flight.\n\nThe ability to effectively produce fresh food in space will be critical for long-duration NASA missions, including exploration missions. The XROOTS Technology Demonstration is a significant step in transitioning from small-scale plant production systems currently being flown to systems of sufficient scale to supplement the crew’s diet and to enhance the quality of the crew’s habitation. This project will advance the Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) of plant-culture technologies for space applications, help scale up current space-based plant growth system technologies to levels appropriate for life-support applications, generate information to understand plant-based systems operating in the real space environment, demonstrate root zone configurations that adhere to real-life space vehicle and space operational constraints, and provide data necessary to better evaluate hybrid life-support architectures for different mission scenarios.\n\nAstro Garden (undergoing testing in the Sierra Space Madison WI facility) represents a potential salad crop production system for space habitats\n\n.

This research often involves spaceflight studies of rodents, insects, and other models in orbiting laboratories such as the International Space Station. However, space-related biological samples are difficult to get, meaning that researchers who want to study space biology are frequently out of luck.\n\nAmerica Reyes Wang, a KBR employee and the lead of theSpace Biology Biospecimen Sharing Programat NASA’s Ames Research Center in California’s Silicon Valley, oversees the team that has changed that. Birthed from an initiative first pioneered in the 1960s, the Biospecimen Sharing Program collects samples and data from NASA non-human space biology studies and makes them available in the public, openNASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR).\n\nTo derive the most benefit from the precious few biology studies taking place in space, Reyes Wang arranges collaborations on space biology dissections with NASA-funded researchers so that her team can collect and preserve unutilized biospecimens for others to use. Outside researchers can request the samples to study in person by writing and submitting proposals. Once analyzed, researchers share their data back with the NASA OSDR for other investigators to access and study.\n\nThe ethos of open science is central to Reyes Wang’s approach to her work. “The samples that we work with are so precious,” she said. “To me, it's a no-brainer — why not share what we can share?”\n\nReyes Wang aspired to work in the scientific or medical field from a young age, driven by her desire to help people. Her father, who was born in El Salvador and dreamed of being an astronaut after watching the 1969 Moon landing, inspired Reyes Wang to fall in love with space. She also credited her Salvadoran and Mexican family with teaching her the value of understanding different experiences.\n\n“To me, being Hispanic, especially as a Latina in STEM, means recognizing and building upon the hard work and sacrifices of those who came before me, as well as extending a helping hand to those around me for the betterment of us all,” Reyes Wang said. “It also means enjoying and sharing our vibrant cultures.”\n\nAs a student at Stanford University, Reyes Wang conducted neurobiology research with rodents, but assumed she would have to choose her love of biology over her love of space. The field of space biology allowed her to combine those interests. Having quietly dreamed of working for NASA for years, she was also thrilled to find that she could work on NASA missions as a space biologist.\n\nAmerica Reyes Wang\n\nBiospecimen Sharing Program Lead\n\nReyes Wang first found a role supporting NASA as an experiment support scientist for the agency’s Rodent Research Program. While she no longer facilitates research on the International Space Station in her current position, she uses her scientific expertise and collaborative outlook to guide the Biospecimen Sharing Program in a direction that will most help advance science.\n\nDespite space biology’s status as a relatively niche field, Reyes Wang has noted its tremendous impact on the biological sciences, medicine, and technology as a whole. For example, spaceflown biological samples are often used to investigate diseases that affect people on Earth. Reyes Wang’s involvement in accelerating these studies captures her long-held desire to help people.\n\n“Open science gives the world an opportunity to get these important answers much more quickly,” Reyes Wang said. “If we want to keep up with the pace of humanity’s aspirations to travel further and for longer, we need to pick up the pace when it comes to getting the answers, and I think open science is one of the best tools we have for achieving those dreams.”\n\nByLauren LeeseWeb Content Strategist for theOffice of the Chief Science Data Officer\n\nMissions\n\nHumans in Space\n\nClimate

While the current space diet is excellent, with numerous highly palatable foods, both the nutritional content and the food quality can degrade if those foods are stored for long durations.\n\nMicrogreens are small, densely grown, young plants that have great potential as space crops. The term “microgreens” actually describes the growth stage of the plant, where true leaves are just emerging.  Because microgreen plants are harvested when they are small, many seeds are planted in a dense configuration to provide sufficient salad to eat. Microgreens require few resources to grow, needing little to no fertilizer and relatively low light. While many seeds are required, the seeds are generally small and lightweight, so a large number can be packed into a tiny cargo. Microgreens grow fast, with most being ready to harvest between 7 and 14 days.\n\nNearly any plant whose leaves, stems, or even roots are edible can be grown and eaten as a microgreen.  Some common types of crops grown as microgreens include broccoli, radish, carrot, basil, and even sunflower.  Microgreens are nutrient-dense; the nutritional composition of a microgreen is between 4 and 10 times that of the same plant grown to maturity. And microgreens are delicious, with flavors concentrated in these tiny plants.\n\nHowever, growing and harvesting microgreens in space without gravity is challenging. Plant roots grow in contact with water and fertilizer, and thus tend to have much higher levels of microbial contamination, which can present food safety concerns.  Therefore, only the microgreen shoots are consumed in space.  In addition, harvesting microgreens requires cutting the small plant stems and then collecting the cut plants. On Earth microgreens are cut with scissors and bagged by hand, though commercial operations may use automatic or robotic harvesting methods.  In space, once the stems are cut, these tiny plants may float around the spacecraft as debris and become difficult to collect and capture. To address these issues, the Kennedy team developed several concepts for growing microgreens with separate root and shoot zones and harvesting and containing them in microgravity.\n\nThe Kennedy team designed growth boxes that separate the root zone and the shoot of the microgreens.  Separating the root and shoot zone not only allows us to understand and characterize the growing shoots by measuring photosynthesis and water loss from the canopy, it also allows for a way to harvest the plant and limit contamination from the roots.\n\nThe Kennedy team tested these growth boxes with different harvesting and bagging methods on parabolic flights. On a parabolic flight, the airplane’s trajectory consists of a series of parabolas, each of which provides approximately 20 seconds of weightlessness followed by 20 seconds of high gravity.  Research flights typically follow a trajectory consisting of a series of six groups of five parabolas. In the Kennedy team’s microgreen test flights, the first group of parabolas induced Martian (3/8 g) and Lunar (1/6 g) gravity levels instead of weightlessness.\n\nThree different harvesting methods were tested in parabolic flight including the traditional approach of using scissors, another using a sliding blade we called “the guillotine,” and a third we called a “pepper grinder,” which consists of two plates that when counter-rotated sever the microgreen. Bagging or containment approaches tested included both manual bagging into a zip-top bag, and using a removable mesh bag with a drawstring that was attached to the growth boxes.  Both bagging methods were tested with all three harvesting approaches.\n\nBecause these plants are small and would float away and potentially be lost in a parabolic flight aircraft, our team conducted the harvests inside a glove box to contain any free-floating plants and debris during the harvests. The glovebox also included cameras to record the activities inside the box, as well as an accelerometer to record the gravity levels and a timer to keep track of the duration of operations.  This glovebox has been used in multiple parabolic flights and was provided by Dr. George Pantalos, University of Louisville, who also served as ground support for our flights.  Three team members on each flight took turns either operating the harvest procedures, assisting with the harvest operations, or coaching on timing, gravity stages, and next steps.\n\nThe team participated in three parabolic flights and conducted 24 different harvests during each parabolic flight. Data were collected via video as well as questionnaires that the operators filled out. In between each set of parabolas, the harvested boxes and bagged microgreens were removed from the glovebox, any debris was cleaned up, and fresh boxes and harvest bags were installed in the glovebox.  After each flight, the harvested microgreens were weighed, and photos of the harvested boxes were taken to see how cleanly plants were cut and what plants and debris remained. The number of loose microgreens generated during each harvest and the effectiveness of the various harvest approaches are being assessed from the videos and data virtually by intern Haley Boles.\n\nIn addition, students involved in the citizen science education programGrowing Beyond Earth,run by Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden in partnership with NASA, have helped our team test other box configurations and plant species as part of this project.  Christopher Bermudez, a student intern at Fairchild Garden, served on the ground team and was ground team photographer for the December parabolic flight tests.\n\nIt takes a village to feed a village, and space crop production research also involves a variety of different groups within NASA.

This condition was unexpected in these very healthy crewmembers who were pre-screened for the risk of blood clots, but developed them anyway. To understand the underlying mechanisms that drive the formation of clots, Principal Investigator Anand Ramasubramanian of the Chemical Engineering Department at San Jose State University (SJSU) decided to investigate blood flow in veins since it is known that blood flow patterns affect clot formation.\n\nIn the absence of gravity, body fluids shift from the legs to the upper body and the head. This shift affects the flow of blood through the vessels in the head. Blood flow patterns are reported to change when astronauts are in space, and interestingly, the degree of change appears to differ between different astronauts.\n\nTo investigate how blood flow affects factors that influence clot formation, Dr. Ramasubramanian teamed up with his SJSU colleagues Dr. John Lee and Dr. Liat Rosenfeld to develop tissue-on-a-chip technologies that mimic a venous valve to closely monitor changes in blood cells as they move around the valves.\n\nIn the first study, the team monitored and measured flow patterns and red blood cell (RBC) movement at the microscopic level. It is thought that the lateral movement of RBCs contributes to the formation and progression of blood clots, or thromboses, not only in venous valves, but also in aortic aneurysms and blood-circulating devices.\n\nUsing freshly drawn blood from healthy human subjects, Dr. Ramasubramanian and his students, Z-na Sanchez and Vignesha Vijayananda, used high speed microscopy to examine the movement of red blood cells and the flow patterns of the surrounding fluid as they moved past an imitation valve built onto a microfluidic device. Measurements taken while observing the blood flow under the microscope showed an uneven distribution of RBCs around the artificial valves and undesirable stresses on the vessel walls. The team has been able to record the motion of individual RBCs getting trapped and circling continuously in vortices to the sides of the valves (see figure below). These results revealed that complex flow patterns may determine how and why clots tend to form around valves.\n\nIn this ongoing study, sponsored by NASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences Division, the SJSU team is investigating the combined effect of flow and the absence of gravity on blood cells using a tissue-on-a-chip system they developed in-house. The system consists of endothelial cells (the type of cells that line our blood vessels) that will be exposed to varying forces due to blood flow and microgravity at the same time to mimic what happens in the veins of astronauts during space flight. This new technology will provide insight on how various bodily and gravity forces affect cells and the formation of blood clots. These studies may be able to determine whether countermeasures can be implemented to reduce the risk of clot formation and why clots formed in only in a few of the astronauts.\n\nDr. Anand Ramasubramanian, Chemical Engineering Department, San Jose State University\n\nBiological and Physical Sciences Division\n\nRead moreTechnology Highlights\n\nA NASA-sponsored team at the University of Iowa (UI) is restoring and advancing the nation’s…\n\nWebb is the premier observatory of the next decade, serving thousands of astronomers worldwide.

The online database contains data from completed physical science reduced-gravity flight experiments conducted on theInternational Space Station, Space Shuttle flights, free flying spacecraft, commercial cargo flights to and from the space station, or from related ground-based studies.\n\nOne of the selected studies will take advantage of the E-FIELD Flames experiment to simulate the behavior of a small diffusion flame under the influence of an externally applied electric field in microgravity. Once validated, the simulations can be extended to Earth gravity. This is expected to lead to a better understanding and eventually control of hydrocarbon flames under the influence of electric fields, which can be used to extend flammability limits, reduce emissions, prevent instability and blowoff, as well as modify soot production. This project is a collaborative effort between the University of California, Irvine, and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and is led by Prof. Yu-Chien Chien (University of California, Irvine).\n\nAnother selected investigation plans to use micromechanics-based computer modeling to analyze scanning electron microscopy images from the MICS (Microgravity Investigation of Cement Solidification) experiment to develop a deeper understanding of the impact of microstructure on the resulting mechanical properties of cement. Based on the cement binders used in the microgravity experiment, this study will provide the first simulation results to predict the  performance of various cement binders fabricated in microgravity. The effort is expected to lead to recommendations on microstructures with improved properties, an important consideration for future construction of shelters and habitats using on-site materials on the surface of the Moon and Mars. The project, a collaboration between Pennsylvania State University and NASA Glenn Research Center, is led by Prof. Namiko Yamamoto (Pennsylvania State University).\n\nThe selected proposals are from five institutions in five states, with the total combined award amount of approximately $988K during a two-year period.\n\nThe Physical Sciences Research Program is managed by theBiological and Physical Sciences Divisionin NASA's Science Mission Directorate. This program conducts fundamental and applied physical sciences research, with the objective of pioneering scientific discovery, enabling space exploration, and providing benefits on Earth. The program furthers fundamental research by investigating the fundamental laws of the universe and physical phenomena in the absence of gravity. The program also conducts applied research, which contributes to the basic understanding underlying space exploration technologies that will further our return to the Moon and our journey to Mars and beyond. Both have led to improved space systems or new products on Earth.\n\nBelow is the complete list of the selected proposals, principal investigators, and their organizations:\n\nWebb is the premier observatory of the next decade, serving thousands of astronomers worldwide.
