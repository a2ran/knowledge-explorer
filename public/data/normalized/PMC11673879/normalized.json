    "abstract": "As global temperatures rise due to climate change, understanding how bacteria respond to heat is essential. Bacteria are critical to ecosystems, helping recycle nutrients, break down organic matter, and support plant growth. If they struggle to adapt to warmer conditions, the effects could ripple through ecosystems. Our study tested whetherBacillusbacteria, common in soil and water, could adapt to gradual temperature increases. We exposed seven strains from two groups to experimental evolution under increasing warming conditions, expecting them to evolve heat tolerance. Although some bacteria showed small improvements in heat tolerance, neither group could evolve to grow well at temperatures just three degrees Celsius above their natural range. This is concerning, as climate change could raise global temperatures by 2 4  degreesC, which could push these bacteria beyond their limits. We also found that c di AMP, a molecule that helps regulate potassium levels in cells, was involved in temperature tolerance. These findings highlight the vulnerability of essential bacteria to climate change and underscore the need for further research to predict and mitigate its impacts on ecosystems.\n\nKeywords:experimental evolution, critical high temperature, phenotypic plasticity, norms of reaction to temperature, convergent evolution, c di AMP, upper thermal limit, evolutionary rescue, thermal plasticity, thermal niche",
    "methods": "Bacillusstrains were originally isolated from Cuatro Cienegas, Coahuila, Mxico, as described [29]. The strains were collected from sediment in the Churince water system. Three strains grouped with theB. cereus lineagewere 99% similar based on sequence variation of the 16S rRNA gene (accession numbers Bc_370aMK850162.1, Bc_102MK880370, and Bc_111bMK850167.1), as well as four strains from theB. subtilislineage (accession numbers Bs_21MK850173.1, Bs_90MK850153.1, and Bs_427MK850159.1and laboratory strain PY79MK850170.1). Accession numbers for the genomes of the strains are:\n\nSAMN09761860:B.subtilis_21_anc_ehb001 (TaxID: 1423);\n\nSAMN09761861:B.subtilis_90_anc_ehb002 (TaxID: 1423);\n\nSAMN09761862:B.subtilis_427_anc_ehb003 (TaxID: 1423);\n\nSAMN09761863:B.subtilis_PY79_anc_ehb004 (TaxID: 1423);\n\nSAMN09761864:B.cereus_370a_anc_ehb005 (TaxID: 1396);\n\nSAMN09761865:B.cereus_102_anc_ehb006 (TaxID: 1396);\n\nSAMN09761866:B.cereus_111b_anc_ehb007 (TaxID: 1396).\n\nStrains were preserved at  70  degreesC in a marine medium [30] supplemented with 80% glycerol. For experimental use, strains were revived by streaking onto marine medium agar plates (1.6% agar) and incubated overnight at 28  degreesC. Single colonies were transferred into a liquid marine medium and incubated at 37  degreesC overnight to establish starting cultures.\n\nTemperature tolerance was assessed by streaking the strains onto marine medium agar plates and incubating them at 37  degreesC, 44  degreesC, and 55  degreesC for 24 h. After the initial incubation, plates were transferred to 28  degreesC and incubated for an additional 48 h. Photographs were taken at both incubation stages to document growth and colony morphology.\n\nSevenBacillusstrains with previously characterized thermal tolerance [14] were selected, comprising four strains from theB. subtilislineage (three wild isolates and the lab strainB. subtilisPY79) and three strains from theB. cereuslineage. Ancestral strains were frozen as reference samples. Experimental evolution was conducted in 50 mL Falcon tubes with cultures agitated at 150 rpm. For each strain, three populations evolved at a constant temperature of 37  degreesC, while another three populations were exposed to an incremental temperature regime starting at 43  degreesC and increasing to 47  degreesC over a period of 90 days.\n\nCultures were diluted 100 fold [31] every 12 h by transferring 50 uL of the culture into 5 mL of fresh marine medium, achieving approximately 1000 generations over 105 days. Generation counts were estimated based on viable cell numbers at saturation and calculated division rates. Turbidity measurements were taken every 12 h. In the incremental temperature treatment, the temperature was raised by 0.1  degreesC per day, contingent on observable growth (turbidity). If growth rates decreased significantly, indicated by low turbidity, temperature increases were paused or reduced, and inoculum volume was adjusted from 50 uL to 100 uL as needed. Temperature adjustments over time were recorded and represented as a parabolic curve (Figure 1A). Weekly samples of each evolving population were stored at  70  degreesC in 80% glycerol. At the experiment's conclusion, colonies from each of the 42 evolved populations were isolated, and a representative evolved strain from each population was selected for further analysis.\n\nExperimental setup and lineage descent. (A) Inoculation and transfers were performed every 12 h until reaching approximately 1000 generations (eight generations per transfer). The plot illustrates the measured temperature profiles of the incubator over 1000 generations both for the population evolved under highly critical temperature (HCT) and the constant (lower) temperature treatment (CTT) at 37  degreesC. The mathematical model for HCT is represented as 4.04 + 0.59(t0.5), with an R2value of 0.8685. (B) The figure depicts the four parental strains from theB. subtilislineage (left) and their respective descending lines labeled from A to L (HCT) and a to l (CTT_37  degreesC). Similarly, three parental strains from theB. cereuslineage (right) are depicted along with their corresponding descending lines named from A to L (HCT) and a to l (CTT_37  degreesC).\n\nReaction norms for parental and evolved strains were determined using growth kinetics at various temperatures. Doubling times were calculated from the exponential growth phase to plot the growth rate against temperature. Strains were reactivated from  70  degreesC stocks on marine medium agar and incubated at 37  degreesC for 20 h. A single colony was used to inoculate 5 mL of marine medium broth and incubated overnight at 37  degreesC with shaking. Cultures were transferred to achieve exponential phase by subculturing 50 uL into fresh broth for 2 h.\n\nGrowth measurements were performed using a Bioscreen C plate reader (Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland) with a 420 580 nm filter. Each well of a 200 well microtiter plate was inoculated with 5 uL of culture and 175 uL of fresh marine medium broth, with three technical replicates per condition. Optical density was recorded every 30 min for 20 h. Growth kinetics were assessed at 17  degreesC, 27  degreesC, 37  degreesC, 41  degreesC, 43  degreesC, 46  degreesC, 49  degreesC, and 55  degreesC. Doubling times were calculated using exponential growth models. Reaction norms were compared usingt tests and multiple ANOVA tests (significance level 0.05) in Statgraphics 15.2.06 and R version 3.6.2.\n\nDNA was extracted using the QuickGene DNA tissue kit S (Kurabo Industries LTD., FujiFilm, Osaka, Japan). Sequencing was conducted at Cinvestav Langebio on an Illumina MiSeq platform at 50x coverage in a paired end format, with ~180 bp fragment sizes. Paired end reads were quality checked using FastQC and trimmed with Trimmomatic. Genome assemblies were generated with SPAdes v3.13.0 and evaluated for quality using N50 and %GC content.\n\nVariant calling was performed using GATK Haplotype Caller, and mutations were annotated with Prokka and Patric. Custom scripts were used to integrate Prokka GFF files with VCF data from GATK. Additionally, we employed a \"fragmentome\" analysis to ensure correct linkage of evolved genomes to their respective parental strains. In this approach, we first generated sets of diagnostic DNA fragments (1000 bp each) from the original ancestral genome sequences. By comparing these fragments against all assembled genomes, we identified those that were uniquely present (i.e., matched only their strain of origin) and thus served as reliable strain specific genetic markers. Using these diagnostic fragments, we could confidently map evolved reads back to the appropriate parental genome. Unlike standard alignments to a single reference genome, this method provides a lineage specific signature that helps distinguish closely related ancestral strains and their evolved descendants. This ensures that any potential cross contamination or mislabeling during experimental evolution or sequencing could be easily detected, as evolved strains must match their diagnostic fragments and not produce hits against other parental genomes. Assembled reference genomes of each representative ancestral strain were obtained, making it possible to generate these strain specific diagnostic fragments prior to the mapping of evolved sequences.\n\nVariants were filtered with a quality threshold of 100, and low quality mutations (<40) were excluded. Mutation categories included intergenic, genic, indels, and single substitutions. Mutations of interest were validated by Sanger sequencing. Annotated mutations were analyzed using UniProt, GO, and PFAM databases. Gene lists, oligonucleotide sequences, and accession numbers for sequencing data for evolved strains are provided inSupplementary Tables.\n\nSporulation was assessed on marine medium plates after seven days at room temperature. Samples were stained with malachite green and examined under a Leica 020 518.500 DM/LS optical microscope (Wetzlar, Germany) to confirm the presence or absence of spores.",
    "results": "We conducted experimental evolution to test if the thermal tolerance of vegetativeBacillusstrains could be enhanced through gradual temperature increases (Figure 1A). Our study included seven strains from two lineages: threeBacillus cereusstrains and fourBacillus subtilisstrains, both of which are part of strongly supported monophyletic clades within theBacillaceaefamily [32,33]. The wild strains were originally isolated from a temperate hydrological system [29,34], and previous research indicated that these strains are mesophilic, with thermal tolerance largely influenced by lineage [14].\n\nWe hypothesized that a gradual increase in temperature would serve as a selective force, potentially expanding the thermal tolerance limits of these strains. With genetic variation among the seven strains, we anticipated diverse adaptive evolutionary strategies. The experimental design involved two temperature regimes: one with a constant temperature of 37  degreesC and another with incremental increases from 43  degreesC, aiming for approximately 1000 generations (Figure 1B).\n\nGrowth at 43  degreesC initially varied significantly among strains. Specifically,B. cereusstrains were highly sensitive, unable to sustain growth beyond 48 h at this temperature, whileB. subtilisstrains exhibited greater resilience. ForB. cereus, growth restoration occurred after lowering the temperature to 42  degreesC, suggesting an evolutionary rescue mechanism.B. subtilis, in contrast, maintained growth more consistently, allowing for temperature increments of 0.1  degreesC per day.\n\nTemperature increments continued until the strains reached a plateau at 45  degreesC after approximately 300 generations and then slowed down (Figure 1A). The increment frequency decreased further until no additional adaptation was observed over the last 300 generations, indicating a stabilization of phenotypes.B. subtilislineages showed a greater overall capacity to survive and adapt thanB. cereus, consistent with their initial phenotypic plasticity.\n\nTo assess changes in thermal tolerance, we compared the reaction norms of evolved and parental strains. Growth kinetics were measured across a temperature range from 17  degreesC to 55  degreesC and doubling times were used to construct growth rate curves.\n\nFigure 2andFigure 3illustrate the reaction norms forB. subtilisstrains. The Bs_21 and Bs_427 strains demonstrated the most substantial increases in tolerance at higher temperatures. Notably, several Bs_21 lines grew successfully at up to 49  degreesC, although the results varied among lines (a b c A C). All Bs_427 evolved lines showed improved growth at 46  degreesC and 49  degreesC, regardless of whether they were evolved under constant temperature treatment (CTT) or the high critical temperature (HCT) regime. This suggests that adaptation may be influenced by factors related to the growth medium. A statistically significant reduction in growth was observed for some Bs_427 lines (B and b) at 37  degreesC.\n\nNorms of reactionBacillus subtilisparental strains (black) and their respective evolved lines at HCT treatment (red) and CTT treatment (37  degreesC) (blue). Vertical bars are confidence intervals; qt 95% (ANOVA analysis,p= 0.05). Horizontal lines at the top of each graph represent the temperature niche of the ancestral strains (black) and strains evolved under CTT (blue) or HCT treatments (red).\n\nNorms of reactionBacillus cereusparental strains (black) and their respective evolved lines upon HCT treatment (red) and CTT treatment (37  degreesC) (blue). Vertical bars are confidence intervals; qt 95% (ANOVA analysis,p= 0.05). Horizontal lines at the top of each graph represent the temperature niche of the ancestral strains (black) and strains evolved under CTT (blue) or HCT treatments (red).\n\nBs_90 exhibited limited improvement in thermal tolerance, with only minor increases in growth at 43  degreesC for the D E d e lines and barely significant growth at 46  degreesC for the D E F lines. The Bs_90 strain was the least capable of growing at 49  degreesC, though all evolved lines still outperformed the parental strain. A trade off was evident in Bs_90, with all evolved lines showing reduced growth at lower temperatures (17 37  degreesC). In contrast, the laboratory strain Bs_PY79 showed consistent growth across temperatures up to 37  degreesC. While some high temperature evolved lines (J K L) demonstrated improved tolerance at 49  degreesC, they experienced a marked reduction in growth at 17  degreesC and 27  degreesC. Interestingly, all Bs_PY79 lines performed similarly to the parental strain at 43  degreesC, without surpassing its tolerance at 46  degreesC.\n\nForB. cereus, the reaction norms revealed minimal improvements post evolution. Strain Bc_370a exhibited poorer growth than the parental strain, particularly for lines evolved under the HCT regime, which showed decreased growth at 27  degreesC and 37  degreesC. Bc_102 demonstrated the best improvements in thermal tolerance among HCT evolved lines, though CTT evolved lines generally showed reduced growth compared to the parental strain. Bc_111b presented a slight increase in growth at 43 46  degreesC for line U, indicating potential thermal adaptation. However, the S T U lines (HCT evolved) exhibited a reduction in fitness across a lower temperature range (17 39  degreesC), suggesting maladaptive consequences of high temperature evolution.\n\nTo further understand the adaptive strategies of evolvedBacillusstrains, we assessed changes in two critical growth parameters: carrying capacity (K) and specific growth rate (G) at 37  degreesC and 43  degreesC. These measurements provided insights into whether the adaptations were multifactorial, impacting not just the growth rate but also the overall population density the cultures could sustain. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of experimental evolution treatments of the traits evaluated for each strain at both 37  degreesC and 43  degreesC highlighted the phenotypic responses and adaptations under different temperature regimes (Supplementary Figure S4).\n\nFigure 4shows the normalized results forB. subtilisstrains. In Bs_21, significant changes were observed in both K37 and K43, suggesting substantial adaptation, particularly for the D E F lines under the high temperature treatment. Bs_90 displayed pronounced effects in K43, specifically for the D E F lines, indicating a temperature driven adaptation. However, the adaptation appeared limited, as growth improvements did not extend uniformly across all lines.\n\nGrowth and carrying capacity in parental and experimentally evolved lines.\n\nIn Bs_427, we observed increases in both K37 and K43 values compared to the parental strain, reflecting an adaptation that may be driven by the growth medium. The enhanced carrying capacity at 43  degreesC suggests some degree of temperature adaptation, especially for the D E F lines. In Bs_PY79, all evolved lines showed increases in K37 and K43, consistent with medium driven adaptation rather than temperature specific changes.\n\nParental strains ofBacillus subtilisare represented by black bars, while their descendant lines under highly critical temperature (HCT) treatment are depicted with red bars and those under constant temperature treatment at 37  degreesC are shown in blue bars. Each panel comprises charts illustrating the maximum change in growth cultures of lines evolved at a constant low temperature (37  degreesC) and at a highly critical temperature (43  degreesC) on the left and carrying capacity (K) at 37  degreesC and 43  degreesC on the right.\n\nFigure 5illustrates the phenotypic changes inB. cereusstrains. Bc_370a showed a strong effect on all lines for the parameter G37, implying adaptation to the growth medium rather than temperature. However, a significant impact on K43 was observed only in the M N O lines, which underwent high temperature evolution, indicating some level of thermal adaptation.\n\nGrowth and carrying capacity in parental and experimentally evolved lines.\n\nIn Bc_102, the analysis of K43 revealed stronger adaptation to high temperature in the P Q R lines compared to p q r. This suggests that thermal adaptation occurred despite the reaction norms not clearly indicating such changes. Specific growth rates (G37) also demonstrated some improvements, although these were less pronounced. For Bc_111b, G43 showed a marked increase across all evolved lines, indicating medium adaptation. However, K43 was significantly higher in the S T U lines compared to s t u and the parental strain, pointing to an evident effect of temperature adaptation.\n\nParental strains ofBacillus subtilisare represented by black bars, while their descendant lines under highly critical temperature (HCT) treatment are depicted with red bars, and those under constant temperature treatment at 37  degreesC are shown in blue bars. Each panel comprises charts illustrating the maximum change in growth cultures of lines evolved at a constant low temperature (37  degreesC) and at a highly critical temperature (43  degreesC) to the left and the carrying capacity (K) at 37  degreesC and 43  degreesC to the right.\n\nTable 1is a summary of the overall impact that evolution at either CTT or HCT had on theB. cereusandB. subtilislineages. It is evident that a single line, Bs _427, was able to extend its thermal tolerance. None of the lines from the laboratory strain PY79 exhibited changes at any of the temperatures evaluated. All the evolvedB. cereuslines reduced their growth capacity compared to the ancestral line.\n\nSummary of temperature plasticity gained on growth and carrying capacity by the evolved lines.\n\n Lower capacity than ancestral line.  Higher capacity than the ancestral line. Empty squares mean the same or similar capacity than the ancestral line. Red, evolved at temperatures above highly critical temperature. Blue, evolved at 37  degreesC. * Points to strains where some lines had mutations in c di AMP synthesis genes.\n\nWe evaluated changes in colonial phenotypes by growing parental and evolvedBacillusstrains on marine medium agar plates (Supplementary Figures S1 and S2). The top rows in the figures show the parental strains, while the lower rows display the six evolved strains (three evolved under the low temperature treatment, LTT, and three under the highly critical temperature, HCT). Our semi quantitative assessments revealed significant changes in colony growth among evolved strains. Notably, theB. cereus evolved lines exhibited a substantial reduction in growth compared to their parental strains, a finding consistent with the reaction norm data. This reduction was particularly evident in lines M, N, Q, S, and T, which underwent HCT treatment. In contrast, theB. subtilis evolved strains demonstrated more resilience, retaining a higher growth capacity.\n\nThe observed differences suggest a trade off inB. cereus, where the selective pressure to endure high temperatures may have compromised their ability to grow rapidly. This trade off likely represents an adaptive strategy prioritizing survival over growth efficiency. Specifically, theB. cereusstrains appear to have evolved a mechanism to endure heat stress by reducing metabolic demands, which could explain their diminished growth rates.\n\nAdditionally, phenotypic changes were evident in colony pigmentation, especially among theB. subtilis evolved lines. We observed distinct pigmentation changes in lines A, B, G, and I, indicative of altered metabolic or regulatory pathways as a response to prolonged heat exposure (Supplementary Figure S2).\n\nWe also noted a loss of sporulation ability in several evolved strains. This was particularly pronounced in theB. cereusHCT evolved lines, suggesting that the evolutionary pressure to maintain vegetative cell function at high temperatures led to a trade off, where sporulation capacity was compromised. This finding aligns with the hypothesis thatBacillusstrains may sacrifice their ability to form heat resistant spores to maintain active metabolic processes, which may be crucial for survival in fluctuating but non lethal high temperatures.\n\nWe sequenced the genomes of a representative clone from both the parental and evolved lines (seven parental genomes, 21 evolved genomes at CTT, and 21 evolved genomes at HCT). The genomes were assembled and annotated, and mutations were identified by comparing each evolved genome to its respective parental genome using GATK tools (see Materials and Methods). A workflow of Bioinformatic Analysis of Evolved Genomes and Mutations is shown inSupplementary Figure S3.\n\nSeven lines exhibited hypermutator phenotypes, characterized by the accumulation of 39 to 219 mutations. These hypermutator lines were excluded from further analysis to avoid skewed results. The hypermutant criterion was established based on a significant deviation from the expected linear distribution of mutation accumulation (Supplementary Figure S5). Hypermutators were identified in bothB. subtilis(lines A and G) andB. cereus(lines N, m, q, r, and S), with no apparent correlation to temperature treatment or bacterial lineage, suggesting that the hypermutant phenotype was independent of these factors. These hypermutant lines are depicted as gray labels inFigure 6.\n\nMutation analysis of strains evolved from theBacillus subtilisandBacillus cereuslineages. Each lineage underwent highly critical temperature (HCT, red) treatment and constant temperature treatment (CTT, blue) with three replicates. The diagram illustrates the treatment conditions for each lineage and the total number of mutations observed after the genome sequencing of a colony from the final evolution transfer. Loss of sporulation in evolved lines occurred in strains marked with red or blue triangles. Lines in gray represent hypermutant phenotypes, which were excluded from our analyses to reduce noise in data correlation. Orange asterisks denote convergent mutations at the gene level in the cyclic d AMP synthase gene (cdaRinB. subtilisordisAinB. cereus), found in independent evolving lines under highly critical temperatures, supporting evidence of positive selection (statistical analysis in the results section).\n\nAfter excluding hypermutators, mutations were categorized into single nucleotide substitutions, one to three base indels, and large genomic rearrangements, further classified as intergenic or intragenic. Most of the identified mutations were single base indels, predominantly affecting open reading frames (ORFs).Figure 7andFigure 8illustrate the specific intragenic mutations.Supplementary Table S1shows a list of all types of mutations in each evolved line. Sporulation loss and the quantification for each mutation type are shown inSupplementary Figure S6.\n\nDistribution of mutations in lines evolved at constant low temperature (37  degreesC) across gene functional categories. The figure displays the distribution of mutations observed in lines evolved at a constant low temperature (37  degreesC), categorized by gene functional categories. Black squares indicate genes with at least one mutation in the depicted category, with the number within the black squares representing the number of mutated genes within that category. White squares denote the absence of mutations in the respective gene functional categories. Gray squares are used for all hypermutant strains that were not analyzed. Additionally, red squares highlight genes that have been described as being associated with the observed phenotype.\n\nDistribution of mutations in lines evolved under highly critical temperature treatment (HCT) across gene functional categories. The figure illustrates the distribution of mutations observed in lines evolved under highly critical temperature treatment (HCT), categorized by gene functional categories. Black squares represent genes with at least one mutation in the depicted category, with the number within the black squares indicating the number of mutated genes within that category. White squares indicate the absence of mutations in the respective gene functional categories. Gray squares denote hypermutant strains that were not analyzed. Additionally, red squares highlight genes associated with the observed phenotype. An orange square specifically highlights di adenylate synthase encoding genes.\n\nIn CTT evolved lines, we identified eight mutations in genes associated with transcription regulation (a o p u lines), six mutations in transport related genes (a c j p lines), and six in sporulation related genes (a d j p lines). A significant mutation was detected in strain Bs_a within the SigB regulon, known for its role in thermal stress response [35]. Additional mutations were found in genes involved in DNA replication, methylation, flagellum assembly, metabolite biosynthesis, and cell wall structure (Figure 8).\n\nIn HCT evolved lines, we found six mutations in transcription regulation genes (B F M O Q T lines) and six in transport genes (B D L M P U lines), reflecting the impact on general metabolic processes. Only one mutation affected a sporulation related gene,lipC, in line B of the Bs_21 strain without causing sporulation defects. Mutations of particular interest included those in glycine betaine transport genes, crucial for both osmotic and thermal stress resistance [36]. Mutations interrupting the DnaD and RNase H encoding genes were found in line B of the Bs_21 strain. DnaD has been reported to be part of the replisome Turner 2004 and for replication fork progression under replication stress [37].B. subtilishas two RNase H genes [38]. In bacteria, RNAse H is involved in the removal of RNA in RNA:DNA hybrids, and, inB. subtilis, the absence of one of the RNase H genes results in an accumulation of hybrids upstream of active coding genes with an impact in transcription and increased mutations [39]. Interestingly, strain Bs_B has 37 mutations, one of the most numerous in evolved lines (Supplementary Table S1). We also identified mutations in arginine metabolism genes linked to thermal stress inB. subtilis[35] and inositol metabolism genes known for their thermoprotective properties [40]. A chi squared test comparing five thermal stress associated mutations in HCT treated lines to one in CTT treated lines suggested a significant temperature dependent effect.\n\nA noteworthy finding was the emergence of mutations in genes encoding di adenylate cyclases (DACs), observed exclusively in HCT evolved lines (Figure 9). DACs synthesize c di AMP from ATP, a secondary metabolite involved in growth regulation, membrane stability, glycine betaine transport, and potassium uptake. We identified three loss of function mutations in thedisAgene ofB. cereus(lines O P T) and two in thecdaRgene ofB. subtilis(lines D and F), with frameshifts occurring in the first half of the ORFs (Supplementary Figure S7). Binomial tests indicated a statistically significant occurrence of these mutations: a probability of 1.68 x 10 4forB. cereusand 1.37 x 10 3forB. subtilis. Given the total number of genes (5200 inB. cereusand 4100 inB. subtilis), these findings suggest a selective advantage for DAC related mutations under high temperature conditions.\n\nConvergent evolution in lines evolved at highly critical temperatures revealed cyclic di AMP as a key player. The figure illustrates convergent evolution observed in lines evolved at highly critical temperature (HCT), highlighting cyclic di AMP as a significant factor. A red X denotes the proteins predicted to be absent due to gene mutation. BothBacillus subtilisandBacillus cereuspossess three cyclic di AMP synthase genes, with two expressed during the vegetative phase and the third restricted to sporulation. InB. subtilis, the mutated gene wascdaR, a regulator of the synthetase gene, while inB. cereus, mutations impacted thedisAgene, the synthetase itself. Cyclic di AMP plays a crucial role in regulating K+ uptake, a critical factor in maintaining osmotic balance, suggesting its role in adapting to heat stress.",
    "discussion": "Our study highlights lineage specific strategies by using experimental evolution with gradual temperature increases. It reveals significant differences in howBacillus subtilisandBacillus cereuslineages evolved thermal tolerance when subjected to gradual temperature increases beyond their thermal niche.B. subtilisstrains displayed minimal changes in reaction norms, reflecting their greater inherent phenotypic plasticity, whileB. cereusstrains showed clear trade offs, such as reduced growth rates at lower and even higher temperatures, indicating that high temperature selection imposed a substantial evolutionary cost. These results suggest that larger initial plasticity might buffer against rapid adaptation under short term experimental conditions.\n\nIn our study, theB. cereusstrains initially struggled under high temperature stress but managed to stabilize and recover growth within weeks, although, several times, we had to stop the regime of increasing temperature until the final 300 generations of constant high temperature selection. These strains accumulated more mutations than those of theB. subtilislineage. This is similar to what Mongold et al. [28] observed forE. coligrowth at the limit of their niche temperature and suggests that evolutionary rescue mechanisms were at play, allowing the strains to persist despite the harsh conditions. The concept of evolutionary rescue is particularly relevant to our observations. Evolutionary rescue occurs when adaptive genetic changes enable populations to recover from near extinction under severe environmental stress [41,42].\n\nWhileB. subtilisbenefited from its broad thermal tolerance,B. cereusneeded substantial genetic adjustments to cope with high temperatures. This observation raises critical questions about the role of plasticity in evolutionary dynamics. Does higher plasticity hinder adaptation by reducing selective pressure, or does it enable immediate survival, allowing for gradual genetic changes? Our data support the notion that short term evolution favors species with inherent plasticity, while long term selection can drive adaptive genetic changes in species with less initial plasticity.B. subtiliscan be considered to possess more thermal plasticity compared toB. cereus. This conclusion aligns with previous findings by Hurtado et al. [14], which highlighted differences between theB. cereusandB. subtilislineages in their upper tolerance limits, comparing strains from a thermal spring to those from a temperate lagoon. In this study, onlyB. subtilis evolved lines exhibited better growth than the parental strain at the HCT. At the same time, three of fourB. subtilislineages surpassed their ancestral strain's tolerance limit even at 49  degreesC. However, it is essential to note that theB. subtilislines evolved at 37  degreesC were also able to increase their thermal limit. The pressure of maintaining continuous growth in this particular medium impacted the metabolism that favored thermal tolerance. This is concordant with the change in carrying capacity that resulted from the experimental evolution, particularly for theB. subtilislines, for which higher carrying capacity changes occur in all lines, whether evolved at 37  degreesC or at high temperature. This contrasts withB. cereuslines, for which only the lines evolved at higher temperatures exhibit increased carrying capacity under heat stress. These results suggest a shift in metabolism. Accordingly, the expression of proteins that provide stress tolerance or the capacity to adapt to new environmental conditions rapidly is expected to be at the expense of growth related proteins, reducing the instantaneous growth rate [43].\n\nFinally, adaptation at high temperatures came with trade offs, as evidenced by poorer growth at lower temperatures. This was observed forB. cereuslines but not forB. subtilis. Our results showed decreased fitness of some of the evolvedB. cereuslines (Bc111 and Bc370) at what was the ancestral strain's optimal growth temperature, as a trade off for adapting to high temperatures. This supports evolutionary theory, which suggests pleiotropic effects, where genes affecting multiple traits may constrain adaptation and result in maladaptation [44].\n\nGenetic analysis revealed that mutations in genes involved in osmolyte metabolism and heat shock responses played critical roles in thermal tolerance. For instance, arginine and trehalose metabolism mutations were associated with improved thermal resilience. Arginine biosynthesis is known to be induced under heat stress [35], and trehalose has been suggested to act as a thermoprotectant, stabilizing proteins and membranes [45]. These mutations differ from those described in Ref. [46] from an experimental evolution experiment withB. subtilis, with a temperature regime of 50  degreesC. Sequencing revealed mutations in genes encoding proteins associated with pathways known to be involved in heat stress response (hrcA,ftsH) and other stress proteins (relAandsigW). We do not expect to find mutations in genes involved in the thermal response, such as those described by Hecker et al. (1996) [36] and Helmann et al. (2001) [35], which, if mutated, would be expected to reduce tolerance to temperature.\n\nA novel and significant finding of our study was the convergence of mutations in DAC genes in several strains in both lineages. DAC genes are involved in the synthesis of c di AMP. BothB. cereusandB. subtilispossess three genes for the synthesis of c di AMP, DisA, and CdaA function in the vegetative phase, while CdaS is sporulation specific [47]. Most studies have been carried out inB. subtilis, and it is known that the activity of CdaA is modulated by CdaR. c di AMP is essential for the growth ofB. subtilisand DisA and CdaA contribute to modulating different DNA damage responses during exponential growth [48]. The parallel occurrence of mutations in DAC genes (cdaRinB. subtilisanddisAinB. cereus,Figure 9) is intriguing. Several lines of evidence suggest that the di adenylate cyclase CdaA is part of the conserved essentialcda glmmodule involved in cell wall metabolism. Notably, this molecule regulates potassium transport and osmotic balance [49]; when bacteria are challenged with high osmolarity, they acquire increased resistance to high temperature and oxidative stresses. The high osmolarity dependent increase in thermotolerance has two manifestations: the elevation of the upper limit of the growth temperature and enhanced survival at otherwise lethal high temperatures [50]. Although c di AMP is involved in many essential pathways, to participate in virulence and osmotic stress, it has not been implicated in thermal stress. The parallel occurrence of mutations in DAC genes (cdaRinB. subtilisanddisAinB. cereus,Figure 9) strongly suggests its role in heat stress tolerance. Our results suggest a lineage specific evolution in the modulation of the c di AMP regulation. In either case, potassium uptake is likely involved in mitigating membrane destabilization caused by high temperatures. InB. subtilisand many other bacteria, a sudden increase in the intracellular potassium concentration is the first response to osmotic stress [51]. Thus, the control of potassium homeostasis by c di AMP might also be part of a larger picture of the regulation of osmoadaptation. It has been shown that a variety of compatible solutes (i.e., glycine betaine, proline) serve as heat protectants forB. subtilis.B subtilishas several redundant transporters, such that a mutation is one of the transporters that has no impact on heat stress [52] on molecular adaptation regardless of whether it restores physiological and molecular processes from a stressed state back toward the unstressed, wild type state, or whether it instead tends to drive the evolution of novelty [53]. Previous studies have suggested the former because studies have shown thatE. coliadapts to high temperature stress (42.2  degreesC) by restoring both gene expression [54,55] and phenotypic characteristics [27] toward that of the unstressed ancestor. We think that expanding the thermal niche requires both adapting gene expression to a new threshold, as the previous level is inadequate for the permanent extra limit temperature stress and the novelty to withstand permanent stress. In this sense, we suggest that cells regulate the levels of c di AMP to fit the novel stressful conditions. These findings open up new avenues for understanding the role of c di AMP in bacterial heat stress response.\n\nOur experimental design, starting with two species and multiple strains, allowed us to explore the potential for parallel evolution [56] and identify multiple pathways leading to thermal tolerance. Parallel evolution, defined as the independent evolution of the same phenotype or genotype in response to identical selection pressures, provides insights into the predictability and diversity of evolutionary outcomes. In this study, we observed that while mutations affecting c di AMP synthesis emerged in all threeB. cereuslineages, only oneB. subtilislineage (Bs_90) evolved a similar mutation. This finding suggests that while the modulation of c di AMP synthesis is a common and potentially \"go to\" solution for thermal tolerance, it is not the only pathway. The presence of c di AMP mutations in multiple lineages across species highlights its broad utility, yet the absence of these mutations in some evolved lines underscores the diversity of evolutionary strategies. This observation supports the notion that standing genetic variation provides multiple routes to equivalent phenotypes, with natural selection shaping the most accessible solutions within specific genetic and physiological contexts.\n\nMultiple pathways can lead to thermal tolerance, even under identical selective pressures, emphasizing the power of parallel evolution to reveal evolutionary constraints and opportunities. These findings align with the idea that evolution often proceeds along a single pathway within a given lineage but that alternative routes remain viable under different genetic or environmental conditions. By leveraging two species and multiple strains, our study underscores the importance of comparative approaches in experimental evolution for uncovering shared and lineage specific adaptation mechanisms.\n\nOur findings suggest that while different genetic pathways can lead to thermal tolerance, these pathways may converge on similar metabolic routes, such as osmotic protection. Mutations in genes regulating c di AMP synthesis highlight one such path, given its role in potassium transport and osmotic balance under stress. However, it is important to acknowledge a significant caveat in our analysis: genome sequencing identifies intragenic mutations that could be associated with the phenotype but cannot infer the impact of mutations in intergenic regions. Additionally, when multiple mutations occur within a genome, it is challenging to discern which specific mutations are responsible for the observed phenotypes. When working with wild strains, it is more challenging to reintroduce single mutations to validate the phenotype. Transcriptomic analyses would be necessary to uncover the overarching metabolic strategies and determine how these mutations integrate into the broader cellular response to thermal stress. Such analyses could reveal differential gene expression patterns and regulatory networks contributing to adaptation, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the metabolic adjustments underlying thermal tolerance.\n\nThe limited thermal tolerance observed in our study, even after experimental evolution, raises concerns about the capacity of microbial communities to adapt to climate change. Given the vital roles ofBacillusspecies in biogeochemical cycles, constraints on their thermal adaptability could have cascading effects on ecosystem functions, nutrient cycling, and soil health. Our findings suggest that while some bacterial populations may experience evolutionary rescue, the associated trade offs could limit their ecological success and impact global processes.\n\nIt is notable that the three strains within eachBacilluslineage (B. subtilisandB. cereus) exhibited consistent, lineage specific outcomes. Furthermore, the three independently evolved lines for each strain displayed similar trends in temperature tolerance, despite differences in the underlying mutations driving their responses. This result suggests a strong influence of both genetic background and lineage specific traits in shaping the adaptive responses to temperature stress inBacillusspecies. The consistency in outcomes within each lineage (B. subtilisandB. cereus) highlights that certain inherent genetic or physiological characteristics predispose these lineages to follow specific evolutionary trajectories.\n\nOur observations indicate thatB. cereuslineages tended to accumulate more mutations yet did not achieve markedly better fitness at higher temperatures, whereasB. subtilislineages adapted to elevated temperatures with comparatively fewer mutations, suggesting greater inherent thermal plasticity or more efficient physiological and regulatory mechanisms for coping with thermal stress. Several factors may underlie these differences. First,B. subtilismay possess a more robust stress response system, including efficient chaperones, heat shock proteins, and membrane adaptations that minimize the need for extensive genetic change. Second, differences in metabolic versatility and regulatory network flexibility may enableB. subtilisto rapidly optimize gene expression and protein function at higher temperatures, whileB. cereusmay rely more on genetic alterations that do not directly translate into fitness gains. Additionally, species specific genomic architecture and mutation biases could shape distinct evolutionary trajectories, withB. cereuspotentially having less efficient DNA repair or a mutational spectrum that fails to confer adaptive benefits under thermal stress. Furthermore, the evolutionary histories and ecological niches of these species influence their baseline adaptability; for instance, the laboratory adaptedB. subtilisstrain like PY79 may have evolved pre adaptations suited to fluctuating conditions, whereasB. cereus, adapted to more stable environments, struggles to exploit novel thermal niches despite generating substantial genetic variation. For example, such lineage specific adaptations have been documented by Guinebretire et al. (2008) [57], who showed that different taxonomic groups ofB. cereusdisplay lineage associated thermal profiles ranging from 7 to 50  degreesC, explaining whyB. cereuspopulations in warm parts of a dairy process differ from those in colder parts [58].\n\nThe observed lineage specific outcomes and convergence within strains underscore the critical role of genetic background in shaping adaptive responses. However, the diversity of underlying mutations leading to similar phenotypic outcomes highlights the unpredictability of evolutionary pathways. This variability suggests that microbial responses to environmental stressors, such as climate change, may be highly context dependent and difficult to generalize. Each genetic background provides a distinct set of constraints and opportunities, leading to diverse adaptive trajectories even under similar selective pressures.\n\nConsequently, this result makes it more challenging to predict how microbial communities, composed of diverse genetic lineages, will respond to global warming. While some lineages may adapt via predictable mechanisms, others may follow entirely different and unforeseen evolutionary paths. This underscores the need for further studies that explore the interplay between genetic background, evolutionary dynamics, and environmental change to better understand and anticipate microbial responses at both the species and community levels.\n\nIn addition to well characterized experimental evolution studies inE. coli(e.g., Tenaillon et al. [24]), recent research has increasingly explored evolutionary dynamics inBacillusand other wild bacterial lineages under various selective pressures. For instance,B. subtilishas served as a model in experimental evolution to investigate adaptation in plant associated environments and in the presence of competing species. Pomerleau et al. [59] demonstrated thatB. subtilisrapidly evolved enhanced root colonization capacity under biotic stress imposed byPseudomonasspecies, pinpointing mutations in regulators linked to biofilm development. Likewise, Blake et al. [60] showed thatB. subtilispopulations adapted to the rhizosphere ofArabidopsis thalianadiversified into distinct lineages, with some evolved strains improving their host specific colonization abilities. These findings highlight how environmental context shapes adaptive trajectories and can promote genetic diversification.\n\nOther studies emphasize the role of genetic mechanisms, such as horizontal gene transfer (HGT), in shaping adaptation. Slomka et al. [61] found thatB. subtilispopulations evolving under high salt conditions acquired extensive foreign DNA, improving salt tolerance via bursts of HGT. Although our study focused on thermal adaptation rather than osmotic stress, these results underscore the importance of both point mutations and gene acquisition in driving evolutionary responses and raise the question of whether thermal adaptation might also draw on similar genetic sources if available.\n\nEnvironmental fluctuations and life history traits can further influence evolutionary outcomes. Shoemaker et al. [62] reported that the capacity for dormancy (\"seed banking\") inB. subtilisalters the trajectory of molecular evolution over extended timescales, increasing genetic diversity and affecting the direction of selection on certain genes. Although our experimental design did not directly examine dormancy states, such findings suggest that the intrinsic traits of species, including the ability to form spores, may shape the pace and path of thermal adaptation.\n\nFinally, recent molecular and genomic studies highlight the complexity of responses at the RNA and gene regulatory levels. For example, Jolley et al. [63] demonstrated thatB. subtilisdynamically adjusts its RNA structure in response to temperature changes, potentially providing an additional layer of rapid, non mutational adaptation. Similarly, Hawkins et al. [64] and Shi et al. [65] explored how essential genes and sporulation related loci evolve over time, offering insights into how baseline genomic architecture and gene regulatory networks can influence adaptive potential.\n\nTaken together, these studies show thatBacilluslineages can evolve through multiple genetic routes ranging from single nucleotide changes and HGT events to alterations in regulatory networks to cope with diverse selective pressures, including thermal stress. They also reveal common themes, such as the role of regulatory mutations and pre existing physiological traits, which can set certain lineages on more efficient adaptive trajectories. Integrating this broader perspective into our findings suggests that while the mutation rate and the spectrum of mutations we observed may not necessarily correlate with thermal niche expansion, they reflect a complex interplay of genetic background, regulatory flexibility, ecological context, and evolutionary history. By situating our results alongside these otherBacillusand bacterial evolution studies, we gain a more nuanced understanding of how constraints and contingencies influence the adaptive landscape of bacterial populations facing environmental challenges.\n\nThe experimental constraints of this study, which included the passes for only 1000 generations and laboratory based conditions, may not fully reflect the complexities of long term evolutionary dynamics or the ecological interactions that occur in natural settings. Additionally, while we identified several mutations, especially those related to di adenylate cyclase (DAC) genes, more studies would be necessary to understand their roles. This could involve transcriptomic analysis to better understand gene expression patterns in response to thermal stress. Furthermore, exploring the broader ecological context of these findings, such as how they translate to natural microbial populations and how bacteria respond to other environmental stressors like desiccation or nutrient scarcity, will be essential to evaluate bacterial adaptability and resilience comprehensively.",
    "conclusion": "Our results demonstrate thatBacillusstrains exhibit limited thermal adaptation and are lineage specific, with immediate trade offs even under prolonged selective pressure. This constrained evolvability poses significant implications for microbial responses to global warming, potentially affecting biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem stability. Understanding these evolutionary limits is crucial as we prepare for the ecological impacts of climate change.\n\nThis study emphasizes the need for more research into the evolutionary and ecological limits of microbial adaptability to predict and mitigate the broader consequences of climate change on vital biogeochemical processes."
