    "abstract": "Primary root growth is required by the plant to anchor in the soil and reach out for nutrients and water, while dealing with obstacles. Efficient root elongation and bending depends upon the coordinated action of environmental sensing, signal transduction, and growth responses. The actin cytoskeleton is a highly plastic network that constitutes a point of integration for environmental stimuli and hormonal pathways. In this review, we present a detailed compilation highlighting the importance of the actin cytoskeleton during primary root growth and we describe how actin binding proteins, plant hormones, and actin disrupting drugs affect root growth and root actin. We also discuss the feedback loop between actin and root responses to light and gravity. Actin affects cell division and elongation through the control of its own organization. We remark upon the importance of longitudinally oriented actin bundles as a hallmark of cell elongation as well as the role of the actin cytoskeleton in protein trafficking and vacuolar reshaping during this process. The actin network is shaped by a plethora of actin binding proteins; however, there is still a large gap in connecting the molecular function of these proteins with their developmental effects. Here, we summarize their function and known effects on primary root growth with a focus on their high level of specialization. Light and gravity are key factors that help us understand root growth directionality. The response of the root to gravity relies on hormonal, particularly auxin, homeostasis, and the actin cytoskeleton. Actin is necessary for the perception of the gravity stimulus via the repositioning of sedimenting statoliths, but it is also involved in mediating the growth response via the trafficking of auxin transporters and cell elongation. Furthermore, auxin and auxin analogs can affect the composition of the actin network, indicating a potential feedback loop. Light, in its turn, affects actin organization and hence, root growth, although its precise role remains largely unknown. Recently, fundamental studies with the latest techniques have given us more in depth knowledge of the role and organization of actin in the coordination of root growth; however, there remains a lot to discover, especially in how actin organization helps cell shaping, and therefore root growth.\n\nKeywords:actin, root growth, cell elongation, auxin, gravitropism, actin binding protein, light",

    "conclusion": "The actin network has been studied for a long time and there is a relatively large body of earlier work on the role of actin in regulating root growth. In the recent 5years, this work has been revisited and expanded upon (Abu Abied et al., 2018;Takatsuka et al., 2018;Oulehlov et al., 2019;Arieti and Staiger, 2020;de Bang et al., 2020). Although this sometimes led to contradictory or incomplete findings, the actin network is essential for root growth by regulating cell elongation and division. A main conclusion is that actin organization is developmentally regulated in the growing root tip. Bundled and longitudinally oriented actin filaments are a hallmark of cell elongation. Failure to achieve this arrangement by tampering with hormonal homeostasis or altering actin binding protein function results in root growth defects. Most results with hormone and drug treatments and actin binding protein mutants seem to correlate well with this general principle. These changes in actin organization affect cell growth in different ways, and of particular interest for further study is how actin mediated delivery of cell wall modifying components aids cell elongation of the primary root meristem. There are also causal links between actin, vacuolar morphology, and cell elongation. However, more evidence is needed to show that defects in actin directly cause defects in vacuolar morphology that subsequently cause root growth defects.\n\nKnowledge in this field is lacking evidence on the role of actin binding proteins in regulating the actin network with regard to growth and development of the root meristem. In general, actin binding proteins are well studied, however, with respect to root growth, there is little data available on phenotypic effects, usually due to a high degree of genetic redundancy. Overexpression often leads to detrimental effects on root growth, while single or even double mutants do not. With recent advances in CRISPR multiplexing, this redundancy problem can be tackled efficiently and the roles of actin binding proteins in root growth and development can and should be elucidated.\n\nHormonal regulation of primary root growth occurs mainly through the coordination between auxin and cytokinin signaling, which contributes to the generation of developmental regions with a specific actin organization. The role of auxins, cytokinins, and especially other hormones in the control of the actin cytoskeleton requires more future work. This work would be made easier by the consistent and more precise denomination of which root zones and cell layers are analyzed, in order to compare the effects of individual hormones and their combination in the control of the actin network. Related to this is the study of root gravitropism, where actin has several different functions. It is involved in the direct sensing of gravity, controls the propagation of the hormone signal and it is likely involved in the subsequent regulation of cell elongation. This study brings together three different roles for actin and is therefore a very interesting subfield, which will benefit by recent advances in live imaging. With vertically oriented confocal laser scanning microscopes it is possible to study root gravitropismin vivoin real time and see details and subtleties not imaged before. Another new way of studying actin will be to use new optogenetic tools that allow the direct manipulation of the cytoskeleton or cytoskeletal components (Zhang et al., 2021), which might provide a deeper understanding of how actin functions in regulating cell elongation in complex tissues such as the root. With these new possibilities it will be possible to subtly disturb the actin network while imaging it at the highest temporal and spatial resolution."
