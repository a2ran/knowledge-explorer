For evaluation of BL's long term effects, Col 0 plants were grown on 1/2 MS agar media for 7 DAG in the presence or absence of BL (H). To analyse expression of QC related genes in diverse BR mutant plants, Col 0 or En 2 and their mutant plants were grown on 1/2 MS agar media for 8 DAG (I).

(This figure is available in colour atJXBonline.)\n\nStaining and detection of beta glucuronidase (GUS) activity was performed according to the method ofJefferson (1987), with some modifications. In brief, roots were fixed in 90% acetone for 20min and infiltrated with staining buffer [0.1M phosphate (pH 7.0), 10mM EDTA, 2.5mM K4Fe(CN)63H20, and 1mg/ml X  GLUC]. The resulting stained root tissues were then fixed and processed as described in mPS PI staining method.\n\nmPS PI staining was performed according to the method ofTruernitet al.(2008)with some modifications to reveal cell shape, the presence of starch granules, and auxin maximum (described inFigs 2,3and4). In brief, roots were fixed in fixative (50% methanol and 10% acetic acid) and then incubated in 1% periodic acid after rinsing with water. Next, the tissues were treated with modified Pseudo Schiff reagent (100mM sodium metabisulphite and 0.15N HCl, supplemented with freshly added PI to a final concentration of 100 ug/ml). The samples were transferred onto microscope slides and covered with a chloral hydrate solution (4g chloral hydrate, 1ml glycerol, and 2ml water) for 5min to observe fluorescence or reflection signals using the Zeiss Confocal microscope.\n\nBL dose dependent and BZR1 /BES1 mediated signalling pathways have differential effects on the differentiation of distal CSCs.

Cells with PI stained starch granules (black dots) or cells below the starch stained cell layers were considered columella cells.

(This figure is available in colour atJXBonline.)\n\nPI, YFP/GFP, and GUS signals were obtained using a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with an argon 2 ion laser (488nm) and a He/Ne 1 ion laser (543nm). For observation of PI stained roots, samples were excited at 543nm to collect the PI signal at 595 615nm or excited at 488nm to detect GFP signal at 493 545nm or YFP signal at 521 560nm. For observation of mPS PI stained roots, samples were excited at 488nm and the emission was collected at 520 720nm to detect the PI signal. The stained signal for GUS activity was obtained using the reflection mode of the confocal microscope. In this case, the excitation wavelength was 488nm, and the reflection signal was collected at 485 491nm. Images were compiled and analysed using the LSM 710 ZEN image browser software.\n\nTotal RNA was isolated from root tissues using the Plant RNA Extraction Kit (Intron Biotechnology, Korea) and treated with RQ1 RNase Free DNase (Promega, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative real time PCR (qRT PCR) was performed by the SYBR green method using the Applied Biosystems Step One Plus System (Applied Biosystems, USA). The expression of each transcript was normalized against the amount ofUBC1control in each sample.CPDwas used as a control for BR repressed genes. The results were reported as expression relative to the Col 0 mock control (Figs 1G,1H,5A,5B,6A, and6B) or Col 0 or En 2 genetic control (Figs 1I,5C, and6C). Three to five biological replicates were included in each experiment, and the data were statistically analysed using the Student'st test. Primers used for the qRT PCRs are summarized inSupplementary Table S1(available atJXBonline).\n\nBR  and BZR1 mediated signalling pathway modulates transcriptional expression of diverse root regulating genes. (A C) Quantitative RT PCR analysis of root controlling genes in BL treated Col 0 and BR related mutant plants. Plants were grown and expression of root regulating genes was analysed for short term BL treated plants (A), long term BL treated plants (B), and BL related mutants (C) as described inFig. 1G I. (D) ChIP qPCR assay of the BZR1  and BES1  bindingcis motif of root regulating genes. BZR1  and BES1 bound chromatin DNA fragments were isolated from roots of week old Col 0,pBZR1::BZR1 YFP, andp35S::BES1 GFPplants using anti BZR1 antibodies. Next, quantitative PCR analysis was performed with the primer sets listed inSupplementary Table S2as described in Materials and methods. Each primer set amplifies a region of the promoter simplified inSupplementary Figure S2(available atJXBonline) containing the BZR1 binding BRRE sequence (5 CGTGT/CG 3,Heet al., 2005) and E box (5 CANNTG 3,Yinet al., 2005). Promoters ofUBC30andPP2Agenes were used as negative controls for BZR1  and BES1 binding motif. The promoter ofDWF4was used as a positive control (Sunet al., 2010). All ChIP qPCR analysis was repeated with a minimum of triple biological replicates and the data were statistically analysed by the Student'st test.\n\nChIP experiments were performed as previously described with minor modifications (Gendrelet al., 2005) using the non transgenic Columbia 0, plants expressing native promoter driven BZR1 GFP (pBZR1::BZR1 YFP), and plants constitutively expressing BES1 GFP (p35S::BES1 GFP). In brief, week old seedlings were cross linked with 1% formaldehyde and the chromatin DNA fragments (~500bp in length) were isolated from their nuclei of root tissues to retrieve BZR1 or BES1 binding DNA fragments using rabbit polyclonal anti GFP antibodies (Abcam, UK). The bound DNA fragments were then extracted using the Gel/PCR DNA fragments extraction kit (RBC Bioscience, Korea) and the amount of the bound DNA was measured by performing real time PCRs with the primer sets listed inSupplementary Table S2(available atJXBonline) using equal amounts of DNA from the input and the CoIP fractions.",
    "results": "The QC is the source of stem cell initials and is maintained at the G1/S cell cycle checkpoint and thus divides infrequently (Jiang and Feldman, 2005). BR induced nuclear localization of BES1, a positive regulator of the BR signalling pathways, in the QC promotes QC reactivation, leading to production of two layers of QC cells (Gonzalez Garciaet al., 2011;Heymanet al., 2013;Vilarrasa Blasiet al., 2014) and results in CSC differentiation (Gonzalez Garciaet al., 2011). In this report, whether BZR1, a BES1 homologue, is also actively involved in BR regulated QC regulation was tested. BZR1 is primarily localized in the nucleus of epidermal cells and some cortex cells of the proximal root tips ofpBZR1:BZR1 YFPplants when they are grown in medium lacking BL (a type of BR) (Fig. 1A). It was found that, contrary to a previous report (Vilarrasa Blasiet al., 2014), supplying BL in the medium enhanced nuclear localization of BZR1 in the cells of the SCN area, so that concentrated nuclear expression was found in the root tip cells including the QC, cells above the QC, the CSC, and CCs (Fig. 1A). Similar localization of BZR1 was evident within 15min when BL was applied to 7 d old seedlings (data not shown). This implies that not only the reported BES1  but also the BZR1 mediated BR signalling pathway may actively be involved in QC division and the distal CSC differentiation.\n\nTo assess roles of the BZR1 mediated signalling pathway in these developmental processes, whether the BR and BZR1 mediated signalling pathway modulates the mitotically inactive status of the QC was investigated. Col 0 plants grown on medium containing 10 10M BL showed an increased frequency of mitotically activated QC cells, such that 58% of plants had two layers of QC cells with periclinal division by 7 d after germination (DAG) as determined by morphologic lineage (Fig. 1B). In comparison, 5% of untreated Col 0 plants harboured double layers of QC cells. Consistent with a previous report (Gonzalez Garciaet al., 2011), more than 80% of plants with thebes1 DBR signalling enhancing mutation in an En 2 background showed reactivated QC cell layers by 7 DAG, increasing to 100% by 14 DAG (Fig 1B,C;Supplementary Table S3, available atJXBonline). It was next examined whether BZR1 mediated BR signalling results in similar QC reactivation. It was found that the QC was also frequently reactivated in BR signalling enhancedbzr1 Dplants, such that two QC layers were observed in 50% of the plants by 7 DAG and in 75% of the plants by 14 DAG (Fig. 1B,C;Supplementary Table S3). This QC reactivation was less frequent than that inbes1 Dplants, but was greatly enhanced compared with Col 0 and BR signalling defectivebri1 116plants, which hardly ever showed QC division at 7 DAG. Introduction ofbzr1 Dclearly reactivated the QC ofbri1 116(divided QCs were present in 37% of thebri1 116/bzr1 Dplants by 7 DAG and 69% by 14 DAG), which implies that BRI1/BZR1 mediated BR signalling is actively involved in reactivation of QC division.\n\nWOX5expression in the embryonic cell lineage leads to QC formation and is involved in maintaining the stem cell state in a non autonomous manner (Haekeret al., 2004;Sarkaret al., 2007). It was demonstrated that the QC markerWOX5was expressed in both divided QC cells while a cortex marker (pCO2::YFPH2B,Heidstraet al., 2004), was unchanged in its expression pattern when these plants were grown on medium containing BL (Fig. 1D). SCARECROW (SCR) is required for specification of QC identity, stem cell homeostasis and asymmetric cell division (Sabatiniet al., 2003;Moubayidinet al., 2013). In this study, the SCR reporter plants grown on medium containing BL reactivated QC cell division as determined by morphologic cell lineage but, unexpectedly, SCR protein accumulated predominantly in the upper QC in most BL treated cells. To verify the effect of BR on QC division,bzr1 Dwas crossed with different cell specific marker lines (Fig. 1D). Forbzr1 DxpWOX5::GFP, 50% of the plants showed GFP expression in both the upper and lower cells of the QC whereas the other 50% showed expression only in the upper cell. In mostbzr1 DxpSCR::GFP, the GFP signal was present only in the upper cell of the QC. This lack ofWOX5andSCRexpression in the rootward QC cells may indicate an asymmetric QC division and loss of functional QC identity.\n\nEthylene overexpressor 1 (ETO1) and CULLIN3 (CUL3) are a part of the ubiquitin E3 ligase complex that modulates the level of 1 Aminocyclopropane 1 carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase 5 (ACS5) catalysing the rate limiting step of ethylene biosynthesis. It was previously reported that the gain of functioneto1 11mutant overproduces ethylene and promotes QC cell division (Ortega Martinezet al., 2007). In this regard, it was tested whether the BZR1 mediated BR signalling pathway interacts with ETO1 promoted ethylene pathway in the regulation of the QC cell division.bzr1 Dplants grown for 8 DAG showed QC cell division at a frequency of 74% (Fig. 1E). Treatment of neither an ethylene action inhibitor AgNO3nor biosynthetic inhibitors, aminoethoxy vinylglycine (AVG) and CoCl2, interfered with thisbzr1 D induced QC cell division. Similarly, treatment ofeto1 11mutants with BRZ, a BR biosynthesis inhibitor (Asamiet al., 2000), did not significantly influence the QC reactivation frequency ofeto1 11plants (Fig. 1F). Moreover, botheto1 11genetic background provoking QC cell division at a frequency of 61% and treatment of BL inducing cell division at a frequency of 45% additively coordinated the promotion of QC cell reactivation, thus BL treatedeto1 11plants showed two layered reactivated QC cells at a frequency of 97%. These results indicate that BZR1 mediated BR signalling and ETO1 promoted ethylene signalling pathways independently act on the QC reactivation event in a parallel manner.\n\nSupporting BZR1 mediated QC reactivation, expression ofWOX5,SCR, andSHRgenes was significantly increased by both short term (3h,Fig. 1G) and long term (7 DAG,Fig. 1H) treatments of BL. Consistent with BR induced up regulation, their expression was significantly repressed in BR signalling defectivebri1 116plants, but greatly increased in signalling enhancedbzr1 Dplants andbri1 116/bzr1 Ddouble mutants (Fig. 1I). In addition, BL treatment greatly suppressed gene expression ofBRAVO(a negative regulator of QC divisions;Vilarrasa Blasiet al., 2014) and increased the expression ofERF115(a positive regulator of QC division;Heymanet al., 2013) in both the short term and long term treated Col 0 plants (Fig. 1G,H). Again, their expression was tightly controlled in a BRI1/BZR1 mediated signalling dependent manner (Fig. 1I). Expression ofBRAVOandERF115was similarly regulated inbes1 Dplants to those ofbzr1 Dplants. Expression of genes regulating ethylene biosynthesis was also examined, and it was found that expression ofCUL3,ACS5, andETO1was not regulated by BR treatment nor was it different inbzr1 Dorbes1 Dplants compared with the Col 0 or En 2 plants, respectively (Fig 1G I). These results support the conclusion that BRs promote QC cell division independently from the ethylene pathway.\n\nResults presented thus far have shown that the BRI1/BZR1 mediated BR signalling pathway was able to reactivate and produce multiple layers of the QC (Fig. 1B;Supplementary Table S3available atJXBonline). In addition, BL treatment greatly enhanced expression of a columella initial marker,J2341, and expanded its expression to the QC, CC, and other root tip cells (Fig. 1D). These observations, together with BL induced intense nuclear localization of BZR1 in the QC, CSCs, and CCs (Fig. 1A), prompted an investigation of the effects of BR on the maintenance and differentiation of distal CSCs by examining the development of starch accumulated columella cells.\n\nFirst, the cell layer number of QC, CSC, and CC was measured for Col 0 (Fig. 2A) and BR biosynthesis defectivede etiolated2(det2;Noguchiet al., 1999) (Fig. 2B) plants grown on media containing various concentrations of BL, ranging from 10 15to 10 9M. To do this, root tips were stained with PI by performing mPS PI staining to mark cell walls and starch granules. As expected, BL stimulated division of the QC in a concentration dependent manner in both Col 0 anddet2plants. Less than 10% of Col 0 plants grown on media lacking BL carried two layers of QC, and the proportion of plants with the divided QC was greatly increased after exogenous treatment with BL: 60% and 82% of Col 0 plants grown on medium containing 10 10M and 10 9M, respectively, contained two layers of QC (Fig. 2A,D). In contrast, differentiation of CSC into CC was inhibited by the BL treatment. Most Col 0 plants grown on media lacking BL carried a single layer of CSCs, and only 15% of plants had two layers of CSCs. The proportion of Col plants with two CSC layers was moderately increased (25 30%) by the 10 15M to 10 11M of BL treatment, and it reached to 52% by the 10 10M BL treatment, which implies that BL inhibits CSC differentiation into CC. Consistent with this, treatment of exogenous BL reduced the number of CC layers. For example, Col plants grown without exogenous BL had 57% seedlings with four layers of CCs and 43% with three layers of CCs (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, the proportion of plants with fewer CC layers steadily increased with increasing amount of BL treatment, so that plants grown on medium containing 10 10M BL showed 25% seedlings with four layers of CCs, 68% with three layers of CCs, and 7% with two layers of CCs. These concentration dependent developmental trends of QC, CSC, and CC layers were clearly reproduced in BL treateddet2plants (Fig. 2B).\n\nSurprisingly, treatment of Col 0 plants with a higher concentration of exogenous BL resulted in opposite effects on CSC differentiation and CC development: it promoted CSC differentiation and the resulting CC development. Seventeen percent of Col 0 plants grown on 10 9M BL had two layers of CSCs, which is far below the frequency compared with those of the plants grown on 10 15M to 10 11M of BL, and is about the same frequency as with mock treated plants. Moreover, plants with no CSC (whose starch granules of cells resided underneath the QC were stained with PI) were present at a frequency of 18%, which was hardly observed in the mock  and lower BL treated Col 0 plants (Fig. 2A,D). Consistent with this observation, an increased frequency of plants with a higher number of CC layers was observed in plants grown on medium containing 10 9M BL than in plants grown with lower concentrations of BL. Similar observations were previously reported in Col 0 plants treated with 4x10 9M BL and thebes1 DBR gain of function mutant (Gonzalez Garciaet al., 2011). Interestingly, this effect was not observed in BL treateddet2plants (Fig. 2B). Treatment of BR deficientdet2plants with higher concentrations of BL further increased the number of CSC layers and dramatically decreased the number of CC layers accordingly. These results strongly indicate that BRs differentially regulate distal CSC differentiation in a concentration dependent manner: they inhibit the stem cell differentiation at low concentrations and promote it at higher concentrations. In support of data presented here, Col 0 plants grown on media containing BK, an inhibitor of BIN2 (a negative regulator of the BR signalling pathway) (De Rybelet al,2009) showed similar results to plants treated with lower concentrations of BL (data not shown). Also of note was that BL treatments not only modulated CSC differentiation, as determined by counting the number of cell layers stained with PI or below the stained cells, but also weakened the intensity of PI staining (Fig. 2D). At the extreme, most Col 0 plants treated with 10 9M BL had 1 3 cells in the lowest layers that were not stained at all. This result implies that BR may be involved in starch development as well as differentiation of the distal meristem.\n\nNext, to investigate the BRI1/BZR1 dependent regulation of QC division and CSC differentiation, the frequency of QC, CSC, and CC layers in diverse BR related mutant plants was examined. As previously reported (Gonzalez Garciaet al., 2011),bes1 Dplants grown in MS media under the present experimental conditions showed enhanced QC reactivation and distal cell differentiation (Fig. 2C,E). Twenty percent of En 2 plants had two layers of QC and the remaining 80% carried a single QC cell layer. In comparison, more than 70% ofbes1 Dplants harboured two layered QCs. Moreover, the proportion ofbes1 Dplants with no CSC also dramatically increased. It was found that 52% of thebes1 Dplants had single layered CSCs and the rest had no CSC, while 83% of En 2 plants carried single layered CSCs and the remaining 17% had two layered CSCs. In accordance, the frequency of plants with higher CC layers was increased in thebes1 Din that 16% of the plants had five layers, 39% four layers, and 45% three layers. In comparison, En 2 plants showed 3% with five layered, 27% with four layered, and the remaining 70% with three layered CCs.\n\nComparing Col 0 plants withbri1 116,bzr1 D, andbri1 116/bzr1 Dplants, 17% of Col 0 plants had two layered QCs and the remaining 83% showed single layered QCs by 8 DAG on MS media (Fig. 2C,E). In the same population of Col 0 plants, it was found that 90% of plants carried single layered CSCs and a half developed four layered CCs while the other half developed five layered CCs. In comparison, the frequency of plants with single layered QCs and CSCs in a BR signalling defective mutant was slightly increased so that 98% of thebri1 116plants carried single layered QC or CSC. This implies that a defective BR signalling pathway may result in retardation of QC or CSC cell division or differentiation. Development of CCs was also slightly inhibited compared with the Col 0 plants: 20% ofbri1 116plants had five layered, 72% four layered, and the remaining 8% had three layered CCs. Interestingly, a similar trend of reduction in CC layers was also observed in the BRZ treated Col plants (data not shown). A BR signalling enhanced mutant,bzr1 D, showed an increased frequency of plants with two layered QCs as expected (80% with two layered and the remaining 20% with single layered plants). In addition, the frequency of plants with two layered CSCs also dramatically increased (45% with two layered and the rest with single layered plants) as seen in the case of BL treated Col 0 plants. Concurrently, the frequency of plants with fewer CC layers in thebzr1 Dmutant was greatly increased in that 32% of the plants had four CC layers and the remaining 68% had three layered CCs. A double mutant of the BR signal pathway,bri1 116/bzr1 D, had a similar frequency of plants with QC layers tobzr1 Dand an intermediate frequency of plants with CSC and CC layers betweenbri1 116andbzr1 1D. These results imply that differentiation of CSC and the resulting development of CC are under the control of the BRI1/BZR1 mediated BR signalling pathway, and that the BZR1 mediated BR signalling pathway, in opposition to BES1 mediated signalling, inhibits the differentiation of distal CSCs, thus delaying development of starch filled columella cells. In addition, it seems that a defect in either BR biosynthesis (in the case of BRZ treated Col plants) or in the signalling pathway (in the case ofbri1 116) show similar results to BL treatment and BZR1 mediated signal enhancement.\n\nThe auxin signalling pathway that stimulates differentiation of CSCs requires activation of auxin responding factors, ARF10 and ARF16 and subsequent restriction ofWOX5transcription in the QC (Wanget al., 2005;Ding and Friml, 2010). Based on these findings, whether the inhibitory effect of the BZR1 mediated BR signalling pathway involves interaction with auxin activities in the distal area was examined. Ninety percent of Col 0 plants grown on MS media without exogenous BL carried a single layered CSC and the remaining 10% of plants had two layers of CSCs (Fig. 3A,B). In the same population, 23% of the Col 0 plants had five  or six layered, 64% had four layered, and 13% had three layered CCs. As reported previously (Ding and Friml, 2010), Col 0 seedlings grown on medium supplemented with an auxin (1 naphthaleneacetic acid, NAA) led to a decrease in CSC layers and a resulting increase in CC layers. For example, the frequency of plants with single layered CSCs in NAA treated Col 0 seedlings was greatly decreased to 52% from 90% in the untreated Col 0 plants. Moreover, 48% of the NAA treated plants showed no CSC at all. Accordingly, the frequency of NAA treated plants with more CC layers increased significantly: 30% of the auxin treated plants carried six layered CCs, 35% with five layered, and the remaining 35% had four layered CCs. Conversely, treatment of plants with an auxin action inhibitor (PEO IAA,Yoshimotoet al., 2012) increased plants with more CSC layers and with fewer CC layers compared with those of Col 0 plants.\n\nBZR1 mediated BR signalling pathway partly acts upstream of auxin in the regulation of CSC differentiation. (A) Effects of auxin related chemicals on the differentiation of distal CSCs in Col 0 andbzr1 Dplants. (B) Pictures of representative seedlings used for the cell layer measurement presented in (A). Seedlings were grown for 8 DAG on 1/2 MS agar media in the absence or presence of NAA (10 6M) and PEO IAA (2x10 5M). The CSC and CC layers were identified as described inFig. 2.n>50 seedlings for each treatment. (This figure is available in colour atJXBonline.)\n\nIt has been shown in BL treated Col 0 andbzr1 Dplants that the frequency of plants with a higher number of CSC layers was increased and the number of CC layers was decreased compared with those of Col plants (Figs 2A Cand 3A). However, NAA greatly negated the effects of thebzr1 Dmutation, so that it led to a dramatic increase in the frequency of plants with fewer CSC layers and subsequent enhanced differentiation of CSC into CC layers, as in the case of Col 0 plants treated with the same chemicals (Fig. 3A,B). For example, 32% of PEO IAA treatedbzr1 Dplants carried no CSC layer while only 6% of the untreated plants had no CSC layer. For CC layers, 58% of PEO IAA treatedbzr1 Dplants carried five layered CSCs while only 5% were observed in untreated plants. In addition, treatment of PEO IAA to thebzr1 Dplants slightly augmented thebzr1 Dmutation effect, so that the frequency of plants with more CSC layers and with fewer CC layers was slightly increased compared with the untreatedbzr1 Dplants. For example, 45% of PEO IAA treatedbzr1 Dplants carried two layered CSCs while 31% of the untreated plants had two layered CSCs. For CC layers, 72% of PEO IAA treatedbzr1 Dplants carried four layered CSCs while this was observed in 66% of the untreated plants. Nonetheless, it was noticed that treatment of NAA or PEO IAA to thebzr1 Dplants did not completely lead to frequencies of CSC and CC layers observed in Col 0 plants treated by the same auxin related chemicals. These results indicate that BZR1 mediated BR regulation on CSC differentiation and the following CC development partly act on the auxin action antagonistically, and a part of BZR1 mediated BR regulation for these developments may act in parallel to auxin.\n\nAuxin is synthesized at the shoot tip and transported down to the QC and columella initials in the root tip where the auxin maximum is formed (Blilouet al., 2005). Disruption of the auxin expression domain leads to defective development of the distal meristem (Frimlet al., 2002). Based on the finding that BR acts antagonistically on auxin action in the regulation of CSC differentiation, whether BR modulates the auxin expression domain (auxin maximum) was examined in the root tip usingDR5::GUSandDR5::GFPplants as auxin sensing reporters. To do this, roots were stained by performing either a GUS activity assay followed by mPS PI staining to reveal cell walls and starch granules together with auxin accumulating cells (Fig. 4A,C), or regular PI staining with live tissues to reveal cell walls (Fig. 4B). Auxin gradually accumulated from the QC to the CCs with the highest concentration at the CSC, CC1, and CC2 areas in most plants grown on MS medium without BL (Fig. 4A). About 35% of seedlings also showed auxin maximum at the root tip cells including the QC. Increasing the concentration of BL in the MS medium to 10 10M shifted this expression domain longitudinally upward so that auxin was heavily concentrated at the QC, CSC, CC1, and the proximal area. For instance, more than 80% of BL (10 10M) treatedDR5::GUSseedlings showed this pattern of auxin expression. Similarly, theDR5::GFPexpression domain inbzr1 Dplants andmx3transgenic plants ectopically expressing the mutated form ofBZR1(pBZR1::bzr1 D CFP) moved to the proximal area (Fig. 4B). Consistent with the BL driven proximal shift of the auxin maximum, BK treatment mimicking the BR induced positive signalling pathway moved the auxin accumulating domain to the proximal area, whereas treatment of the GUS reporter plants with BRZ reversed the BR effect on the maximum movement (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, someDR5::GUSplants treated with 10 9M BL resulted in enforced accumulation of auxin in the root tip area including the proximal zone, QC, and CCs (Fig. 4A). This is coincident with the finding that treatment of Col 0 plants with higher concentrations of exogenous BL resulted in opposite effects on CSC differentiation and CC development compared with those induced by lower concentrations of BL (Fig. 2A,D). As expected, the gradual expression ofDR5::GUSand correct establishment of auxin maximum were dramatically abolished in plants grown in medium supplied with NAA, in which auxin was uniformly accumulated in all root tip areas at a high level (Fig. 4C). Supplying BL together with the NAA in the growth medium did not reverse this tendency, thus a high amount of auxin remained through the root tip.\n\nThe presence of the auxin maximum and the auxin gradient along the root are the result of collective activities and topologies of the PIN proteins (Grieneisenet al., 2007). Specifically, PIN3, PIN4, and PIN7 play important roles in the positioning of auxin maximum and the following regulation of root patterning and distal meristem differentiation (Frimlet al., 2002;Blilouet al., 2005). To examine whether BR modulates transcript expression and protein localization of PINs in the root tip area, BL was applied to the root of Col 0 and PIN reporter plants for 3h or for 7 DAG and their gene expression and subcellular protein localization was examined. Interestingly, BL differentially regulated the expression ofPINs in a concentration dependent manner: treatment of Col 0 roots for a short period (3h) with BR at low concentration (5x10 10M) greatly suppressed expression ofPIN3,PIN4, andPIN7genes whereas treatment with a higher concentration of BL (5x10 6M) resulted in enhanced expression ofPIN7(Fig. 5A). A similar down regulation ofPINgene expression was also observed for plants growing on a MS solid medium containing 5x10 10M BL for a long period (7 DAG) (Fig. 5B). This regulation ofPINgenes, especially forPIN4, was dependent on BRI1 /BZR1 mediated signalling pathways so that gene expression ofPIN3,PIN4, andPIN7was significantly enhanced in abri1 116background compared with the Col 0 plants. On the other hand, expression was significantly down regulated (PIN4), slightly increased (PIN3) without statistical significance, or maintained at the Col 0 control level (PIN7) inbzr1 Dplants (Fig. 5C). Moreover, up regulation of thePINgenes bybri1 116mutation was partly negated by thebzr1 Dmutation background inbri1 116/bzr1 Ddouble mutants. Thisbzr1 Ddown regulation effect ofPINgenes resembles exogenous BL treatment at lower concentrations. In contrast,PIN7expression was greatly increased inbes1 Dmutants, which resembles the gene expression in plants treated with a higher concentration of BL. These results are consistent with the observation that BR has opposing effects on the differentiation of distal CSCs in concentration  and BZR1 /BES1 dependent manners.\n\nNext, the PIN reporter plants were treated with BL, as done for the gene expression analysis, and PIN protein expression and subcellular localization was examined (Fig. 5D F). Without BL treatment, PIN3 GFP protein ofpPIN3::PIN3 GFPplants in this experimental condition accumulated in the cell membrane of CSC and CC1 to the CC3 with predominant expression in CC1 and CC2 (Fig. 5D,F; upper panel). In contrast when BL was added to the incubation medium at a higher concentration (10 6M) for 3h, the PIN3 expression domain was restricted mainly to CC1 and CC2 and disappeared from CC3. At the same time, the characteristic plasma membrane localized PIN3 pattern was gradually diminished, and PIN3 appeared in endosome  or vesicle like internal structures (Fig. 5D) at a frequency of 25% in mock treated plants, which jumped to 65% in the BL treated plants (Fig. 5E). Finally, growing PIN3 reporter seedlings on medium supplemented with 10 10M BL for 7 DAG resulted in a significant decrease in the number of PIN3 expression layers and intensity of the PIN3 protein expressed (Fig. 5F). For example, 44.4% of the reporter plants showed PIN3 GFP expression in >3 columella cell layers with high expression level while 27.8 % expressed in 1 2 columella cell layers with low expression intensity. In contrast, BL treated plants displayed 36.8% of plants with expression in >3 columella cell layers with high or medium expression intensity, and 57.9% of plants showed expression in one columella cell layer with low expression intensity. PIN4 GFP protein showed a nonpolar localization mainly in the membrane of CC1 to CC3 with prominent basal accumulation (Fig. 5F; middle panels). PIN7 GFP protein showed a similar expression pattern with prominent expression in CC2 (Fig. 5F; lower panel). Similar to the BL treatedPIN3::PIN3 GFPplants, treatment of BL (10 10M) topPIN4::PIN4 GFPandpPIN7::PIN7 GFPplants for 7 DAG resulted in a reduction in expression layers and intensity of reporter proteins. In conclusion, the BR signalling pathway modulates PIN gene expression and protein localization, which may lead to proximal relocation of the auxin maximum in the root tip.\n\nTranscriptional regulation of many protein factors plays an important role in the establishment, maintenance, and differentiation of the root apical meristem (reviewed inLeeet al., 2013). In this report, results have shown that BR induced and BZR1 mediated signalling pathway regulates expression of several root regulating genes includingPINs andWOX5. To have a better understanding of how BR regulates CSC differentiation, transcriptional expression of other key root regulating genes was examined in the presence or absence of BL.\n\nSOMBRERO (SMB) and FEZ proteins antagonistically regulate distal stem cell differentiation through transcriptional negative feedback regulation: FEZ promotes periclinal root cap forming cell divisions and SMB negatively regulates FEZ activity, repressing stem cell like divisions in the root cap daughter cells (Willemsenet al., 2008). Therefore, it was determined whether BR regulates expression ofSMBandFEZand whether the mode of this regulation is opposite for these genes. In Col 0 plants, BL up regulatedSMBexpression whereas it down regulatedFEZexpression for short  and long treatment with both low and high concentrations of BL (Fig. 6A,B). Inbri1 116plants,SMBexpression was down regulated but recovered to the level of Col 0 plants by introducing abzr1 Dmutation (bri1 116/bzr1 D,Fig. 6C). Given the fact that thesmb 3mutant has more CC layers andfez 2has fewer CC layers (Willemsenet al., 2008), these results indicate that the BR induced up regulation ofSMBand down regulation ofFEZmay contribute to the BR induced and BZR1 mediated suppression of CSC differentiation. In support of this idea,FEZexpression was significantly down regulated inbzr1 Dplants. BEARSKIN 1 (BRN1) and BRN2, together with SMB, directly activate transcription of both vascular nac domain (VND) and nac secondary wall thickening promoting factor (NST) to regulate cell maturation in the root cap, which undergoes terminal differentiation and detachment from the root (Bennettet al., 2010). The results showed that BR up regulatedBRN2expression in Col 0 plants during both short  and long term treatment, and that this was under the control of BRI1/BZR1 mediated gene expression (Fig. 6A C). The expression ofBRN1in Col 0 plants was not significantly changed by short term treatment of BL, but was slightly decreased by prolonged treatment with 5x10 10M of BL. Interestingly, its expression was enhanced inbes1 Dplants. Further studies are needed to carefully analyse how this regulation of gene expression is linked to BR  and BZR1 mediated root cap maturation.\n\nSince BR regulates transcriptional expression of diverse root controlling genes in a BZR1 or BES1 dependent manner in this system, it was tested whether BZR1 or BES1 binds to the promoter of these genesin vivoby performing ChIP qPCR analysis usingpBZR1::BZR1 YFPandp35S::BES1 GFPplants. It was found thatBRAVOandERF115contain at least one or two BZR1 and/or BES1 binding motifs in their promoter regions (Fig. 6D), and this is consistent with the previous result showing that their expression was tightly controlled by BRI1/BZR1 mediated signalling (Fig. 1I).PIN3,PIN4, andPIN7genes contain at least one BZR1  and BES1 binding motif, and these results are strongly supported by a previous report demonstrating that BZR1 may bind toPIN3,PIN4,PIN7as evidenced by ChIP microarray (ChIP chip) performed using transgenicArabidopsisplants expressing the BZR1 CFP protein from theBZR1promoter (Sunet al., 2010). TheBRN1gene had at least one BZR1 and BES1 binding motif (Fig. 6D), but their effect on gene expression was different from each other (Fig. 6C). Taken together, these data indicate that BR induced nuclear BZR1 regulates expression of several key root controlling genes by binding to their promoters, which may be resulting in BR induced modulation of root stem cell division and differentiation in the root tip area including columella cell layers.",
    "discussion": "A root is formed from a reservoir of undifferentiated cells, called root stem cells, in the root apical meristem. QC cells act as integrators for many processes and events that are requisites for root meristem establishment and maintenance. Previous studies proposed that QC cells might send short range non cell autonomous signals that help the initials remain in an undifferentiated state (van den Berget al., 1997;Scheres, 2007). CSC initials and the differentiated columella cells are longitudinally adjacent to the QC. Results presented here showed that BZR1  and BES1 mediated BR signalling pathways acted differentially in the regulation of the QC and CSC differentiation (seeSupplementary Figure S3atJXBonline for a schematic model). Both pathways promoted ectopic QC cell division by down regulating expression ofBRAVOrepressor while at the same time up regulatingERF115, a positive regulator of QC division. In contrast, the effects of BRs in the regulation of maintenance and differentiation of the distal meristem were both BZR1 /BES1  and BL dose dependent. The BRI1/BZR1 mediated BR signalling pathway inhibited the differentiation of distal CSCs, thus delaying the development of starch filled columella cells. In contrast, BRI1/BES1 mediated BR signalling showed opposite effects on differentiation of the distal meristem, as previously reported (Gonzalez Garciaet al., 2011). Similarly, application of low concentrations of exogenous BL (~ <=10 10M) resulted in the inhibition of CSC differentiation, similar to the results of the BRI1/BZR1 mediated BR signalling pathway, while higher concentrations of BL (>=10 9M) stimulated CSC differentiation as observed in BRI1/BES1 mediated BR signalling. Similarly,bes1 Dseedlings were resistant to BRZ (a BR biosynthetic inhibitor) in both dark  and light grown conditions (Yinet al., 2002) whereasbzr1 Dseedlings are resistant to BRZ in the dark but are hypersensitive in the light (Wanget al., 2002). It has also been reported that BES1 acts as a transcriptional activator while BZR1 was shown to be a transcriptional repressor (Heet al., 2005;Yinet al., 2005). It is conceivable that differences in BZR1 /BES1 dependent signalling dynamics provide the basis of the concentration dependent differential responses. In fact, expression of distal CSC regulating genes, such asFEZandBRN1, seem to be differentially regulated inbzr1 Dandbes1 Dplants.\n\nBRs interact with multiple hormone signalling pathways in the regulation of root growth and development (Leeet al., 2013;Zhuet al., 2013for review). Regarding the interaction with auxin, BRs act synergistically with auxin to promote lateral root development by increasing acropetal auxin transport (Baoet al., 2004), and enhance plant tropic responses by promoting the accumulation of PIN2 from the root tip to the elongation zone (Liet al., 2005). Transcript profiling and ChIP chip experiments have revealed that BZR1 binds to the promoters of many genes involved in auxin biosynthesis, transport, and signalling (Sunet al., 2010). It has been demonstrated that BRs down regulate transcriptional expression ofPINsand change subcellular localization of their proteins, and thus may alter the auxin localization domain and subsequent root patterning. Supporting this model for BR induced down regulation ofPINgenes in roots and the resulting antagonistic action of BR against auxin induced CSC differentiation, it was recently proposed that oppositely patterned and antagonistic actions of BR and auxin maintain the stem cell balance and optimal root growth (Chaiwanon and Wang, 2015). Epidermis driven BR signalling and activity is not associated with changes in the expression level of stele localizedPINs(PIN1,PIN3, andPIN7) (Hachamet al., 2011), but modulates transcriptional expression ofPIN2andPIN4and their accumulation in the epidermis/cortex and columella in a post transcriptional manner (Hachamet al., 2012). Thus, similar to the model proposed here, the authors proposed that BR directed auxin distribution represents at least one mechanism that contributes to BR mediated root growth. In particular, AtPIN4 mediates the sink driven auxin gradient and the resulting auxin maximum in the QC and the columella initial, and thus controls signals for the QC to regulate auxin driven root patterning. Consequently, the loss of function mutantAtpin4exhibits a divided QC, increased number of both CSC and CC layers, and increased root cap and swelling (Frimlet al., 2002).\n\nRecent studies showed that auxin induced repression ofWOX5results in enhanced CSC differentiation (Ding and Friml, 2010). The BL treated plants andbzr1 Dplants with enhanced BR signalling used here exhibited a decreased level of auxin in the distal root area and increased expression ofWOX5. Concomitantly, they exhibited reactivated QCs, an increased number of undifferentiated CSC layers, and a corresponding decreased number of columella cell layers. In summary, these findings indicate that the BZR1 mediated BR signalling pathway inhibits auxin dependent distal stem cell differentiation inArabidopsisroots through action that is antagonistic to the auxin/WOX5 dependent pathway. It is also possible that BR driven nuclear BZR1 directly binds to the promoter of root regulating genes such asPINs,BRAVO,ERF115,FEZ, andBRN1, and independently regulates QC division and the distal stem cell differentiation. Interestingly, abscisic acid (ABA) induces the expression ofWOX5and thus maintains quiescence of the QC and suppresses differentiation of the columella initials (Zhanget al., 2010). This phenomenon of ABA inducedWOX5expression and promotion of stem cell maintenance is opposite to the BZR1 mediatedWOX5induction and reactivation of QC division in root tips that was observed in this study. Based on these apparently contradictory reports, it is highly plausible that differential regulation or mode of action of each hormone is involved in multiple cellular processes in distinctive root tissues or cell types, such as the QC, CSC, and CC. Therefore, it will be necessary to clarify their mode of action and interactomes by dissecting details of these regulatory frameworks and establishing their interaction with other hormones. It has been demonstrated that BZR1 mediated BR signalling and ETO1 promoted ethylene signalling pathways independently act on the QC reactivation event in a parallel manner. Supporting this observation, treatment of ethylene biosynthetic precursor ACC promoted QC division without promoting BZR1 nuclear accumulation in the QC (Chaiwanon and Wang, 2015).\n\nDecoding the BR dependent regulatory network in a cell type specific manner remains a significant challenge, and any information will be useful in mapping BR interactomes with different pathways and uncovering how distinct tissues are coordinated (Fridman and Savaldi Goldstein, 2013). Here, it has been shown that the effects of BRs in the regulation of QC and distal meristem activities are both BL dose  and BZR1 /BES1 dependent. Nonetheless, when and how BRs control stem cell maintenance and differentiation in roots remains largely unknown. Therefore, future studies must clearly dissect the connections among the dose dependent perception of BR signals in a cell or tissue, the downstream signalling molecules, and the subsequent developmental patterning occurring in roots. Traditionally, an ARF bindingDR5 based auxin inducible reporter (Ulmasovet al., 1997;Barbezet al., 2013) and an Aux/IAA based auxin signalling sensor (DII VENUS;Brunoudet al., 2012) have been widely used to accurately map auxin response and distribution at high spatiotemporal resolution in a single cell based tobacco system andin planta. Thus, one useful approach would be to develop BR specific sensors (reporters) and monitor real time spatiotemporal changes in BR abundance in a cell or a tissue and perform computational modelling to establish BR distribution circuits during the developmental progress. In addition, the identification of BR regulated target genes in a specific cell type or at a specific developmental time and clarifying their interactive regulation by other hormones will provide another level of understanding of BR regulated meristem function in plants.",
