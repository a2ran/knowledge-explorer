    "abstract": "Introduction:Traveling to nearby extraterrestrial objects having a reduced gravity level (partial gravity) compared to Earth's gravity is becoming a realistic objective for space agencies. The use of plants as part of life support systems will require a better understanding of the interactions among plant growth responses including tropisms, under partial gravity conditions.\n\nMaterials and Methods:Here, we present results from our latest space experiments on the ISS, in which seeds ofArabidopsis thalianawere germinated, and seedlings grew for six days under different gravity levels, namely micro g, several intermediate partial glevels, and 1g, and were subjected to irradiation with blue light for the last 48 h. RNA was extracted from 20 samples for subsequent RNAseq analysis. Transcriptomic analysis was performed using the HISAT2 Stringtie DESeq pipeline. Differentially expressed genes were further characterized for global responses using the GEDI tool, gene networks and for Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment.\n\nResults:Differential gene expression analysis revealed only one differentially expressed gene (AT4G21560, VPS28 1 a vacuolar protein) across all gravity conditions using FDR correction (q < 0.05). However, the same 14 genes appeared differentially expressed when comparing either micro g, low glevel (< 0.1g) or the Moong level with 1gcontrol conditions. Apart from these 14 shared genes, the number of differentially expressed genes was similar in microgravity and the Moong level and increased in the intermediateg level (< 0.1g), but it was then progressively reduced as the difference with the Earth gravity became smaller. The GO groups were differentially affected at eachg level: light and photosynthesis GO under microgravity, genes belonged to general stress, chemical and hormone responses under low g, and a response related to cell wall and membrane structure and function under the Moong level.\n\nDiscussion:Transcriptional analyses of plants under blue light stimulation suggests that root blue light phototropism may be enough to reduce the gravitational stress response caused by the lack of gravitropism in microgravity. Competition among tropisms induces an intense perturbation at the micro glevel, which shows an extensive stress response that is progressively attenuated. Our results show a major effect on cell wall/membrane remodeling (detected at the interval from the Moon to Mars gravity), which can be potentially related to graviresistance mechanisms.\n\nKeywords:Arabidopsis, fractional gravity, microgravity, stress response, RNA Seq, spaceflight",
    "methods": "Seeds ofA. thalianaecotypeLandsberg erecta(Ler) were flown to the ISSviathe SpaceX Dragon. Spaceflight experiments were conducted utilizing the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) in the Columbus Module of the ISS. The EMCS facility provides two centrifuges for creation of simulated gravity vectors, as well as atmospheric, temperature and hydration monitoring and control (Brinckmann and Schiller, 2002;Brinckmann, 2005;Kiss et al., 2014). In addition, the EMCS contains a video camera for image acquisition as well as monitoring of growth. The Seedling Growth series of experiments was conducted in two parts. The first set of seedlings were uploaded on SpaceX CRS 2 (March 2013) followed by returnviaCRS 3 (May 2014), and the second set of seedlings were carried to the ISS on SpaceX CRS 4 (September 2014) and returned on CRS 5 (February 2015).\n\nExperimental containers were uploaded to the ISS and loaded into the EMCS as previously described (Kiss et al., 2014;Vandenbrink and Kiss, 2016;Vandenbrink et al., 2019). Experimental conditions were controlled remotely from the Norwegian User Support and Operations Centre (N USOC; Trondheim, Norway). The experiment was initiatedviahydration of the seeds. Plants were grown under 6 nominal gravity conditions produced by different rotational speeds on the EMCS centrifuge, microgravity (stopped EMCS centrifuge), 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.8, and 1.0g. The angular speed to generate each fractional gravity level was calculated for the cassette in the center of the Experimental Container. In the case of the 1.0 g cassettes, the value was calculated for the fifth cassette in order to prevent values higher than Earth nominal gravity. Seedlings were illuminated under white light (30 40 umol m 2s 1) for 96 h, followed by 48 h of unidirectional photostimulation with blue light. Light sources were LEDs (Kiss et al., 2014). RNA Seq analysis was only conducted on seedlings exposed to unidirectional blue light. After conclusion of the experiments, seedlings were frozen in dedicated holders by placing them at  80 degreesC in the General Laboratory Active Cryogenic ISS Experiment Refrigerator (GLACIER) freezer of the ISS. Upon return of frozen seedlings to Earth, samples were transported on dry ice and immediately preserved with RNALater for subsequent RNA Seq analysis.\n\nRNA was extracted individually for each EC TROPI cassette for most of the samples (i.e. from 24 cassettes, 20 samples were obtained to collect approximately 10 15 seedlings per extraction). A plant specific RNA extraction NucleoSpin kit (MACHEREY NAGEL, Catalog # 740949.250) including a DNase treatment was used to isolate whole plant mRNA. The quantity and quality of the extracted RNA was determined by Nanodrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific). Extracted RNA was keep frozen at  80 C until shipped on dry ice to the David H. Murdoch Research Institute in Kannapolis; North Carolina, USA. During sequencing, twenty total RNA samples were used to generate twenty sequencing libraries using the Illumina TruSeq RNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina, USA). Samples were individually indexed. The samples then were combined at equimolar proportions into three pools with 6 7 samples per pool. Each pool was loaded onto a single lane of a flow cell. A 125bp paired end sequencing run was performed on the Illumina HiSeq2500.\n\nPaired end 125bp reads were aligned to theArabidopsisTAIR10 genomes using the HISAT2 pipeline on the Clemson University Palmetto Cluster (Kim et al., 2015). Fragments with a Phred score below 33 were filtered using Trimmomatic (Trimmomatic, 2013). HISAT2 (v2.1.0) was used to align sequencing reads. Reads were assembled into transcripts using StringTie (v1.3.4). Annotation was conducted using TAIR10 FASTA sequence the TAIR10 genome GTF annotation file (www.arabidopsis.org). This transcriptional dataset has been submitted to the GENELAB database (https://genelab.nasa.gov) and it will be released with the reference GLDS 251.\n\nStatistical analyses of differential gene expression was conducted utilizing DESeq2 (v1.18.1;Anders and Huber, 2010). A multiple test corrected p value (q value;Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995) of 0.05 was employed. The 20 samples were organized to reduce theg level interval within biological replicates so the following groups were established: microgravity (stopped EMCS centrifuge, 4 replicates), low gravity (0.09 +/  0.02g, 3 replicates), Moon gravity (0.18 +/  0.04g, 3 replicates), Mars gravity (0.36 +/  0.02g, 3 replicates), reduced Earth gravity (0.57 +/  0.05g, 4 replicates) and 1gcontrol (0.99 +/  0.06g, 3 replicates). Venn Diagrams comparing the number of differentially expressed genes (DEG) across gravity levels were created using jvenn [http://jvenn.toulouse.inra.fr/app/index.html(Bardou et al., 2014)] with both q value < 0.05 and p value < 0.05. Afterwards, gene ontology (GO) analysis of specific groups of DEGs was performed using BinGO (Maere et al., 2005) with the full list of GO terms (GO_Full) or using PANTHER (Mi et al., 2019) with the molecular functions, biological process and cellular component GO lists. Subcellular localization of DEGs was analyzed using the abundance tool (MMAP) of the Subcellular Localization Database for Arabidopsis Proteins [SUBA4, (Hooper et al., 2017)].\n\nFor a global view of the whole genome transcriptional status alongg levels into the SG1 and SG2 experiment (comparisons versus 1g), global expression patterns were calculated using the Gene Expression Dynamics Inspector (GEDI v2.1) program analysis (Eichler et al., 2003). GEDI profile allows the visualization of the gene expression across the transcriptome generating a mosaic image or dot matrix, consisting of 5 x 9 pixels (average of 5 14 probe sets/tile) using a self organizing map algorithm and standard setting of the software (Eichler et al., 2003). Analysis was done using the signal log2 ratio of the selected probe sets through using the 5,571 probes with any significant (p < 0.05) change in expression from more than 21,000 sequences assignated to annotated genes. The same study was repeated adding the false discovery rate correction (FDR, q < 0.05, 861 genes). Each pixel represents a group or cluster of genes that share a similar transcriptional profile in any experimental condition. Each pixel has a color which reflects the average expression of the genes included in the cluster for each experimental condition compared to 1gcontrol in each panel. The GEDI program SOM algorithm determines which genes should be assigned to each cluster, and then places similar clusters in a nearby area of the mosaic, creating an image and allowing global transcriptome analysis as a single entity for display in different gravitational conditions. For certain pixels of interest, the gene list extracted from the clusters was used to find functional links between genes using Genemania App embedded into the Cytoscape v3.6.1 (Shannon et al., 2003) software with default settings.",
    "results": "We performed transcriptomic studies with young seedlings ofA. thalianathat were grown on the ISS at different gravity levels depending on the rotational speed of the EMCS centrifuge (nominalglevels) and the distance of each cassette to the rotation center (Figure 1). Seeds were hydrated to initiate our spaceflight experiment as previously described (Kiss, 2015;Vandenbrink and Kiss, 2019) showing a positive blue light phototropism in the microgravity samples that it is greatly reduced at 0.1g, and effectively negated at 0.3gand higher gravity levels (Vandenbrink et al., 2016). Root growth was also determined after blue light stimulation. The results show longer roots in microgravity and 1gsamples in comparison with 0.1gseedlings (Vandenbrink et al., 2016).\n\nSetup of SG1/SG2 experiment on board the International Space Station.(A)Image of an experimental container with 5 seedling cassettes inside the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) with the direction to the EMCS rotor center included.(B)Calculatedg level in each of the five culture chambers depending on the distance to the EMCS centrifuge rotor (note that only samples in the 3 positions in bold were included in this analysis, cassettes at 174 and 206 mm from EMCS center did not contain wildtype samples) and different EMCS rotational speed (nominalgvalue). Different background grey tones are used to indicate the samples that were used as replicates for low gravity (0.09 +/  0.02g, 3 replicates), Moon gravity (0.18 +/  0.04g, 3 replicates), Mars gravity (0.36 +/  0.02g, 3 replicates) and reduced Earth gravity (0.57 +/  0.05g, 4 replicates) and 1gcontrol (0.99 +/  0.06g, 3 replicates) in addition to the microgravity samples (stopped centrifuge, 4 replicates).(C)Closer view of 6 day old seedlings growing within a seed cassette at microgravity (CC116), lowg(0.07g, CC136), Moong(0.21g, CC156) or 1gcontrol (1.05g, CC175) conditions with blue light stimulation (from the left). Hypocotyls show a clear positive phototropism at anyg level but roots only show this tropism at microgravity (arrows). For comparison, seed cassettes at lowg(0.07g, CC126) and 1gcontrol (1.05g, CC165) conditions exhibiting root positive phototropism to red light stimulation (from the left) are provided (seeVandenbrink et al., 2016for a detailed phototropism discussion).\n\nDifferential expression analysis was conductedviaDESeq2 (Anders and Huber, 2010) among all five reduced gravity conditions taking into account the calculatedg level experienced in each EC due to the geometry of the EMCS container (Figure 1B), using Earth's gravity (1g) as the reference group, extending previous results from the microgravity samples (Vandenbrink et al., 2019). Initially, a reduced stringency analysis was done to isolate all genes identified as differentially expressed with a p value of p < 0.05. Comparison between ugand 1grevealed 2067 differentially expressed genes, comparisons between low gravity (lower than 0.1g)and 1gpeaked at 2552 genes, comparisons between Moong leveland 1greduced to 2088 genes, comparisons between Marsg leveland 1grevealed 978 genes, and lastly, comparisons between reduced Earthg level (0.57g) and 1gidentified only 411 differentially expressed genes (Figure 2A). In addition to an uncorrected p value of p < 0.05, a stringentBenjamini and Hochberg (1995)FDR q value <0.05 was used in the identification of differentially expressed genes (Figure 2B). Comparison between ugand 1grevealed 296 differentially expressed genes, while fractional gravity comparisons between low gravity (lower than 0.1g) and 1grevealed 568 genes. Comparisons between Moong level and 1grevealed 123 genes and comparisons between Marsg level and 1grevealed 19 genes. Lastly, comparisons between reduced Earthg level (0.57g) and 1gidentified only 2 differentially expressed genes. Only one DEG appeared in all reduced gravity conditions (AT4G21560, VPS28 1 a vacuolar protein sorting homolog gene), another in all but reduced Earthglevel (AT5G45428). There were 12 common DEG in microgravity, lowgand Moongconditions, being most of them related with calcium signaling, redox status and stress response (Supplementary Table 1).\n\nDifferentially expressed genes (DEGs) across the different gravity levels.(A)Venn diagram classifying DEGs using uncorrected p value (p < 0.05).(B)Venn diagram classifying DEGs including an adjusted FDR q value (p and q < 0.05).(C)Ten most significant gene ontology (BinGO GO Full Enrichment) categories from DEG in ugvs. 1gonly (FDR q < 0.05).(D)Ten most significant gene ontology (BinGO GO Full Enrichment) categories from DEG in low gravity (circa 0.1g) vs. 1gonly (FDR q < 0.05).(E)Ten most significant gene ontology (BinGO GO Full Enrichment) categories from DEG in Moon gravity vs. 1gonly (FDR q < 0.05).\n\nThe ten most significant GO terms (BinGO full GO terms list) of the genes differentially expressed (obtained with the adjusted q value inFigure 2B) specifically expressed in ug, low g, or Moon gravity only were identified (Figures 2C E). Not only the number of significantly affected genes, but also the type of genes affected, were clearly different with the increasing partialglevel. In microgravity, we observed an enrichment in GO terms related with light and photosynthesis. In low gravity, there was a quite global stress effect together with chemical and hormone responses. Finally, when plants are grown under the Moon gravity level, the more representative enrichment is related to cell wall and membrane structure and function related genes. In fact, the differential subcellular localization of the DEGs at the Moonglevel shows a clear enrichment in plastid related genes and other cell wall/membrane systems, while the general stress response observed at the lowglevel is characterized by the very large unassigned Subcellular compartment group (Supplementary Figure 1andSupplementary Table 2).\n\nAlthough the effects of partial gon gene expression (at the levels of the Moon or Mars) appeared limited in the first analysis (Figure 2), we then evaluated how the expression recovers to normal values from microgravity to 1gcondition by using a visual tool that creates a mosaic image for eachg level representing the gene expression level of similarly behaving DEG (in at least one of the conditions, n = 5571, p < 0.05 without FDR correction,Figure 3first row). Except in the case of the lowgcondition, it is clear that the areas in red (up regulated gene clusters) and the areas in blue (down regulated genes clusters) that appear in the microgravity panels became quantitative and qualitatively smaller with increasingg level. In the case of the lowgcondition, different clusters and with greater expression changes appears, suggesting an overlapping of two different responses at <0.1glevel. The same result is shown if we apply the FDR correction (n = 861, p < 0.05 and q < 0.05 FDR correction,Figure 3second row).\n\nWhole genome transcriptional status variations alongg levels into the SG1/SG2 experiments (comparisons versus 1g). A 5x9 clustering analysis of the differentially expressed genes (in at least one of the partialglevels, using normalpvalues (first row, n = 5,571 genes) or adjustedq values (second row, n = 861 genes) on the transcriptome have been done with the average of each gene expression level within a similarly expressed cluster across the samples. Values are shown according to the log2 ratio scales at the border of the figure (from highly overrepresented in red to highly down represented in blue). The mean value of  0.3 or  0.7 indicates an overall repression in gene expression under microgravity. The gene density maps are shown in the middle of the figure for each analysis. Calculatedg levels have been obtained by considering replicates the more similar samples across the nominal ug, 0.1g, 0.3g, 0.5g, 0.8gand 1g(precisely, ug(4 replicates), 0.09 +/  0.02g(3 replicates), Moon level (0.18 +/  0.04g, 3 replicates), Mars level (0.36 +/  0.02g, 3 replicates), 0.57 +/  0.05g(4 replicates) and control 1g(0.99 +/  0.06g, 3 replicates).\n\nAdditionally, we took advantage of the GEDI self organizing maps to select the list of commonly upregulated genes due to reduced gravity from the clusters in the first row of the GEDI panels. When the list of obtained genes (Supplementary Table 3) is used as a query in GeneMANIA, a tool to create networks from gene database content, a putative pathway for gravity response is proposed. Several processes related to mitochondria, plastid, cell wall and cell membrane processes are clearly affected together with 4 proteins (out of 156 annotated in the genome) belonging to the F box/RMI like/FDB like domain family (including members asTIR 1auxin signaling gene, cell wall remodeling and even cyclins,Figure 4).\n\nFifteen up regulated genes in reduced gravity conditions can be connected in a gravity response putative pathway. Large circles shown the genes detected in the first row clusters from the previous GEDI analysis (Figure 3) and small circles are candidates to be members of a shared pathway (as detected by Genemania App in Cytoscape v3.6.1). While most of the genes have unknown function, color have been used to highlight shared features among their GO properties. Solid lines shown related features as detected by Genemania app, dotted lines have been added by manual datamining comparisons. Note that four genes expressing F box/RMI like proteins (in red) out of 156 genes (related examples are auxin polar transport genes as TIR 1, cell wall remodeling and even cyclins) in the genome may be key in the definition of a microgravity specific pathway characterized by the highly interconnected nodes in this graph.\n\nFinally, in an attempt to further dissect the differential response to partial gravity, we analyzed separately the up regulated and down regulated DEGs (Figure 5andSupplementary Table 2). We can observe a general pattern in which the number of DEG fades with increasingglevel but with a remarkable exception. In the list of down regulated DEGs without FDR correction there is an unusually high number of affected genes in both lowgand Moonglevel (not shown). These DEGs are more clearly confirmed only in lowgafter FDR correction, in which more than 50% of the non corrected DEG remains significant after the FDR correction. These genes belong to stress related GO terms, particularly related with the accessibility to plant nutrients (Figure 5).\n\nBiological processes affected by reduced gravity (Panther Enrichment in biological process GO). Total number of up regulated and down regulated DEG (p < 0.05) are shown for the five reduced gravity conditions vs. 1gcontrol. The ten most significant gene ontology (Panther biological process GO Enrichment) categories for the three upregulated and the three downregulated DEGs are shown for the microgravity, low gravity (circa 0.1g) and Moon gravity (0.18g) vs. 1g(*** FDR q < 0.001, **FDR q < 0.01, *FDR q > 0.05).",
    "discussion": "Image analysis of seedlings grown during the Seedling Growth suite of experiments previously characterized a novel blue light phototropic response in roots ofA. thalianagrown in conditions of microgravity (Vandenbrink et al., 2016). This relationship was shown to be linearly related to the magnitude of the gravity vector for plants exposed to red light, but plants exposed to blue light showed rapid attenuation of the response in the presence of increasing gravity levels. To determine the differential response to reduced gravity and attempt to dissect the molecular mechanisms of gravisensing, we performed RNA seq analysis to characterize changes in gene expression that may be associated with the novel blue phototropic response. Interestingly, the effect of blue light illumination is clearly observable in the microgravity samples, with a clear enrichment in GO terms related with light perception, photosynthesis and biosynthesis of the photosynthetic complexes as previously reported (Vandenbrink et al., 2019), but it is barely appearing in the GO enrichment analyses that we performed on partial gravity samples, even bellow 0.1g(lowgconditions). Surprisingly, the phototropic response to the blue light seems to be enough to cancel the effects of other genes of interest in gravitational research (as the ones observed at lowgor Moonglevel) to be not significantly affected in microgravity conditions. This result may be complementing previous reports from the same Seedling Growth spaceflight experiment but with plants exposed to red photostimulation. Fundamental plant functions, as cell proliferation and cell growth activity in root meristems, known to be affected by microgravity in the absence of light (Mata et al., 2010) are balanced just by providing a red photostimulation phase (Valbuena et al., 2018). In both red and blue photostimulation samples within the Seedling Growth experiment, roots are exhibiting a positive phototropism that can compensate the gravitropism stimuli role that it is required to preserve meristematic competence in orbit, as shown by the longer root growth in microgravity and 1gsamples in comparison with 0.1gseedlings (Vandenbrink et al., 2016).\n\nThe large number of DEGs detected in the low gconditions (<0.1g) is a striking result of this study. The type of transcriptional response observed in this group is similar to stress related responses reported in other spaceflight or simulated microgravity datasets (Paul et al., 2012;Correll et al., 2013;Sugimoto et al., 2014;Ferl et al., 2015;Kwon et al., 2015;Johnson et al., 2017;Paul et al., 2017;Shi et al., 2017;Zupanska et al., 2017;Choi et al., 2019). In this case, there is a very clear component of \"Response to General Stress\" with a FDR q value <10 10, without any other GO terms to be similarly affected. In contrast the responses at the microgravity level (FDR q value <10 6), or at the Moong level (FDR q value <10 2) are very subtle. We explain these results as being the consequence of the combination of two tropistic responses acting with very low intensity. It is very likely that the subtle blue phototropism and the weak gravitropism signal at approximately 0.09gare competing to take the leading role in providing the fundamental cue for driving seedling growth and plant development. The result is a stress for the plant (blue LEDS are located laterally while the gravity vector is towards the bottom of the cassette), which needs to adapt its developmental plan to an environment without the usual tropistic cues. The transcriptional adaptation to provide a response to this evolutionary novel and challenging environment requires the modification of more than five hundred genes, while microgravity only requires half of this number.\n\nAn alternative explanation to the low geffects that cannot be completely excluded could be put in connection with simulated microgravity experiments. Secondary effects of microgravity simulation facilities (shear or inertial forces) and even small variations in the environmental conditions of experimental and control samples may lead to gene expression variations in a similar set of genes as those observed in the low gsubgroup in this work. Similarly, it is important to take into account the existence of hardware effects when growing plants in real microgravity (Kiss, 2015), including lack of convection, reduced CO2levels, improper temperature, elevated ethylene, spacecraft vibrations, increased radiation exposure, among others.\n\nHowever, the tropism conflict interpretation introduced early on this section seems to have a greater contribution than the artifacts of centrifugation in the low geffects. A hardware side effect explanation is less conceivable since the present study was conducted utilizing the European Modular Cultivation System, which contains an air scrubbing/filtration system designed for removing excess ethylene from the seedlings during the growth phase (Kiss et al., 2014;Kiss, 2015). Thus, even with proper ventilation, a reduction in gene expression of photosynthetic genes was observed in the microgravity samples (Vandenbrink et al., 2019). In the case of the samples exposed to centrifugation, the ventilation effect should be less important, but the centrifugation by itself could lead to additional stress in the samples. However, this centrifugation factor is also present in the 1gcontrol sample, exposed to even higher angular speeds.\n\nSpaceflight experimentation is required to verify that simulation strategies on Earth analogues are reliable and worthy. The continuous validation of the best simulation strategies will optimize and increase our chances of success in future spaceflight experiments (Herranz et al., 2013). Additional research in simulated low gconditions on Earth or even in the Moon surface will help to extend and validate this research work.\n\nCultivating plants as part of life support systems in nearby objects of our planet will require us to expose the plants to the partial ginterval within the two values we examined here, namely, Moong level (0.18 +/  0.04g) and Mars gravity (0.36 +/  0.02g). Although some of the genes and GO terms observed affected at lowerg levels also appeared in these conditions, the existence of the gravitropic response, in combination with blue light illumination, seems to be enough to restore a nearly normal transcriptional state, particularly at the Marsg level. These results are consistent with previous data coming from partial gravity simulation paradigms that validated thatArabidopsisdevelopmental plan is still affected at the Moong level (even more intensely affected than in similar simulated microgravity samples) but that the \"normal\" developmental plan is almost completely restored at Marsg levels (Kamal et al., 2018;Manzano et al., 2018).\n\nThe identity of some of the GO terms significantly affected at the Moong level suggest some structural stress at the level of the cell wall and membrane systems. This result is consistent with other results in spaceflight experiments (Kwon et al., 2015;Johnson et al., 2017;Zupanska et al., 2017). This effect is progressively weaker from Moon g(almost similar to microgravity) to Mars g, which shows a less intense response, but it is still visible atg levels as high as 0.57g, when utilizing the less stringent analysis (Figure 2A). At theseg levels, gravitropism response may be acting and suppressing the recently described blue light root phototropism, (already at the Moong level, seeFigure 1C).\n\nTherefore, we suggest that this transcriptional response could be related with the graviresistance signal that the cells without professional gravisensing organelles (as the statolith in the columella cells of the root) may use to detectg force (Soga, 2013). Particularly at the Moong level, the very weak gravitropic signal may be still in conflict with a graviresistance tension in the cell wall and membrane systems (also weak), inducing and additional stress that is progressively removed when Marsg level is reached. In that regard, we have found that some of the genes changing throughout the series of reduced gravity levels can be connected in a pathway in which certain genes may have a central position (Figure 4). The most connected nodes in the pathway would be the genes involved in the cross talk between the cell membrane localized (AT3G44430 and AT2G34840) and the F box/RMI like/FDB like domain proteins (AT5G56370 and AT5G56380) candidate genes. An important caveat to our results is that RNA was obtained from whole seedlings, despite our assumption that the root is the organ that can discriminate better the weak phototropism and gravitropism signals that are proposed here to be responsible of the transcriptional variations we have shown here.",
    "conclusion": "The results of this study take advantage of the induction of subtle blue light phototropism in roots in spaceflight to discern the transcriptional responses to different tropisms in orbit. Removal of the influence of gravity on blue light illuminated seedlings showed a reduction in gene expression in multiple pathways associated with photosynthesis, suggesting shared molecular pathways between the two tropistic responses, or a functional compensation among them.\n\nIt is important to emphasize that the effects shown at microgravity here are gradually removed by increasingg load. While the phototropic effect is noted at the microgravity level, a general stress response is detected at <0.1g, probably due to conflicting stimuli, just at the detection threshold of photo  and gravi sensing mechanisms. Membrane related gene ontologies became the more significant at the Moong level, and they become progressively weaker at higherg levels, allowing us to discriminate the differential contribution of the classical statolith based gravitropism from other responses based on cell tensegrity that may require a higherg threshold to be fully active (Hoson et al., 2005;Hoson and Wakabayashi, 2015). Therefore, our results are starting to isolate, at the whole transcriptional level, the global effects that are produced by the gravitropism, phototropism and graviresistance mechanisms, working at differentg level thresholds. Future use of mutant lines will help us to confirm and extend these findings, which suggests an intricate connection between gravity and light perception inA. thaliana. In the long term, these results on the interaction among tropisms will be important for the use of plants in bioregenerative support systems needed for the human exploration of the Solar System."
