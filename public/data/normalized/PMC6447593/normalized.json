    "abstract": "Plants grown in spaceflight experience novel environmental signals, including those associated with microgravity and ionizing radiation. Spaceflight triggers a response involving transcriptional re programming and altered cell morphology, though many aspects of this response remain uncharacterized. We analyzed the spaceflight induced transcriptome with a focus on genes that undergo alternative splicing to examine differential splicing associated with spaceflight an unstudied characteristic of the molecular response to spaceflight exposure. RNA sequence data obtained during the APEX03 spaceflight experiment that was collected from twoArabidopsis thalianaecotypes at two seedling stages grown onboard the International Space Station, or as ground controls at Kennedy Space Center, were re examined to detect alternative splicing differences induced by spaceflight. Presence/absence variation analysis was used to identify putative expression level differences in alternatively spliced isoforms between spaceflight and ground controls and was followed by analysis of significant differential alternative splicing. This study provides the first evidence of a role for alternative splicing in the molecular processes of physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment.",
    "methods": "A subset of the data collected during the Advanced Plant Experiment 03 2 (APEX03 2) spaceflight experiment was utilized for this analysis. The APEX03 2 experimental methods have been previously described16including detailed descriptions of the mission in which the experiment was launched, plant material preparations, and plant growth conditions both onboard the ISS and at KSC where ground controls were comparably grown. For this analysis, the data utilized comes from two wild type accessions ofArabidopsis thaliana(Col 0 and WS) sampled at both 4 and 8 days of age during the experiment.\n\nIt should be noted that the APEX03 2 experiment is also referred to as \"TAGES ISA\" (Transgenic Gene Expression System Intracellular Signaling Architecture) by NASA operations nomenclature (http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/1059.html).\n\nSeeds sown on 10cm2petri plates were kept dormant during launch. Germination was initiated after transfer to the Vegetable Production System (VEGGIE) onboard the ISS or at KSC for ground controls. The plates were kept in vertical racks perpendicularly oriented to the light source during growth in VEGGIE. Lighting within the VEGGIE unit was set to provide between 100 and 135umoles/m2/s PAR (photosynthetic active radiation). Telemetric data collected on board the ISS during the spaceflight experiment were utilized to precisely mimic the environment onboard the ISS during the ground control experiment, carried out in the ISS Environmental Simulation Chamber at KSC. General methods associated with harvesting plant matter while on orbit for transcriptome analyses, plate de integration once returned back to KSC, and transport back to the laboratory of the Principal Investigators for analysis has been described in detail for previous spaceflight experiments.4\n\nFour biological replicates were analyzed for each condition tested in the APEX03 2 experiment, where one replicate corresponds to the 10 15 plants grown on one petri plate. The plant material constituting each replicate was then subdivided for use in multiple downstream applications. Five to eight individual plants from each replicate of 4 day old seedlings were combined for RNA extraction. However, to ensure that similar RNA concentrations from replicates containing 8 day old seedlings were obtained, only 2 3 individual plants from each replicate of 8 day old seedlings were pooled for RNA extraction. An Olympus dissecting microscope was utilized to separate leaf and root samples, while hypocotyl regions were set aside. Total RNA was extracted from the dissected roots using the Qiashredder and RNAeasy kits from QIAGEN (QIAGEN Sciences, MD, USA). Remnant DNA was removed via an on column digestion utilizing RNase Free DNase (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany). RNA quality was analyzed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). A cDNA library was produced using the CloneTech SMART Seq V4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit (Clonetech Laboratories, Inc, cat#: 634890). Illumina sequencing libraries were then prepared via the Illumina Nextera DNA Sample Preparation Kit (Cat#: FC 131 1024). Bioanalyzer and quantitative PCR were used to quantify the libraries produced. Pooled equimolar samples were then sequenced using the NextSeq500 instrument in five separate flow cells.\n\nQuality control was done to remove low quality reads and bases with Trimmomatic17using parameters TRAILING:3, SLIDINGWINDOW:4:20, MINLEN:20. Reads were aligned to theA. thalianaversion 10 reference genome (accessed fromhttps://genome.jgi.doe.gov) with Bowtie2 version 2.2.918with parameter  fr. Low quality alignments were filtered out by piping the Bowtie2 output into Samtools19via samtools view  q 30  b | samtools sort. Picard 2.5.0 (https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/) was used with the parameter REMOVE_DUPLICATES=true to remove potential optical duplicates from the alignments.\n\nTranscript assemblies were conducted for each sample using three separate transcript assembly programs. Cufflinks15was used with parameters  library type fr firststrand  u  F 0.05 max intron length 12000 no faux reads utilizing theA. thalianaversion 9 reference genome andA. thalianaversion 10 genome annotation (accessed fromhttps://genome.jgi.doe.gov) to guide transcript assembly. StringTie20was used with parameters  f 0.05  j 2  rf using the same genome and annotation as Cufflinks to guide assemblies. Trinity21was used in genome guided mode with parameters  genome_guided_bam genome_guided_max_intron 12000 full_cleanup SS_lib_type RF min_contig_length 50. The assemblies from Cufflinks and Stringtie were merged using the Stringtie merge function for each sample using parameters  F 1  f 0.05. PASA22was used to reconcile this merged assembly and the assembly from Trinity using parameters  C  R  t Trinity fasta output  cufflinks_gtf merged gtf file  I 12000 ALT_SPLICE ALIGNER gmap, blat.\n\nThe transcriptome assemblies generated by PASA for each sample were merged with Cuffmerge. The file produced by Cuffmerge was then reformatted to agree with the reference genome annotation format and then compared against the reference annotation using gffcompare (https://github.com/gpertea/gffcompare). This merged transcriptome represents all potential transcript isoforms expressed in all of the samples being studied, including both newly discovered isoforms and those previously annotated.\n\nThe abundance of transcripts in each sample was then quantified with the rsem calculate expression functionality within RSEM23using default parameters. The FPKM values of each transcript from each sample were parsed from the RSEM output into a matrix. This matrix was used for downstream analysis of PAV of alternatively spliced transcript isoforms. All isoforms expressed from parent genes without a minimum of two unique transcript isoforms identified within the dataset were removed. This category of discarded isoforms represents isoforms that were not produced as a product of AS as identified by the pipeline used in this analysis. In addition, within each condition all isoforms expressed at an FPKM<10 in at least one out of four replicates were removed from the analysis. Following filtering, lists of spaceflight present, ground control present, and commonly present AS isoforms were generated.\n\nA second round of alignments was done with STAR24version 2.5.2b using parameters  alignIntronMax 12000 outFilterMismatchNmax 8 sjdbOverhang 100 outSJfilterReads Unique outSAMmultNmax 1 outFilterType BySJout to generate files for junction spanning alignments. These alignments were filtered for duplicate reads using Picard with the parameter REMOVE_DUPLICATES=true. STAR allows for the alignment of junction spanning reads, whereas RSEM utilizes Bowtie for alignments, which does not allow for the alignment of these reads. Sequencing depth and splice junction support for a subset of isoforms present or absent in each condition and ecotype was then visualized using Integrative Genomics Viewer14(Supplementary Fig.1 4).\n\nThe alignments from STAR were also used as inputs into Cuffdiff.15Cuffdiff was run using this merged transcriptome as a reference gtf file to discover differential transcription start site usage between spaceflight and ground controls in both ecotypes and developmental stages tested in this analysis. The transcription start sites of isoforms exhibiting differential splicing were parsed from the splicing.diff file output from Cuffdiff for each condition being tested. The isoforms associated with the transcription start sites were parsed from the isoforms.fpkm_tracking Cuffdiff output file and the expression, in FPKM, of these isoforms was parsed from the isoforms.read_group_tracking Cuffdiff output file. The isoform ratios were then calculated using a Python script for isoforms encoded from the same gene and sharing a transcription start site. All isoforms demonstrating an isoform ratio <0.01 in both spaceflight and ground control samples within a given condition were removed, resulting in the generation of lists of genes and their associated isoforms that undergo differential AS in each condition tested (Supplementary Data File2).\n\nFurther information on research design is available in theNature Research Reporting Summarylinked to this article.",
