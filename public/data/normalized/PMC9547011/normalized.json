    "abstract": "The space environment includes unique hazards like radiation and microgravity which can adversely affect biological systems. We assessed a multi omics NASA GeneLab dataset where mice were hindlimb unloaded and/or gamma irradiated for 21days followed by retinal analysis at 7days, 1month or 4months post exposure. We compared time matched epigenomic and transcriptomic retinal profiles resulting in a total of 4178 differentially methylated loci or regions, and 457 differentially expressed genes. Highest correlation in methylation difference was seen across different conditions at the same time point. Nucleotide metabolism biological processes were enriched in all groups with activation at 1month and suppression at 7days and 4months. Genes and processes related to Notch and Wnt signaling showed alterations 4months post exposure. A total of 23 genes showed significant changes in methylation and expression compared to unexposed controls, including genes involved in retinal function and inflammatory response. This multi omics analysis interrogates the epigenomic and transcriptomic impacts of radiation and hindlimb unloading on the retina in isolation and in combination and highlights important molecular mechanisms at different post exposure stages.\n\nSubject terms:Retinal diseases, Epigenomics, Transcriptomics",
    "methods": "The original study was conducted at Loma Linda University following recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals50and was approved on April 30, 2014, by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Loma Linda University (Protocol number 8130028). A detailed description of the experimental setup has been published previously51. Briefly, a total of 59 six month old, femaleC57BL/6Jmice were housed in cages of same dimensions and subjected to one of four experimental conditions: sham control with no radiation or unloading (N=15), hindlimb unloading (N=14), low dose irradiation (N=15), and a combination of hindlimb unloading and low dose irradiation (N=15) for 21days (Supplementary Table1). Hindlimb suspension was used to model the unloading, fluid shift, and physiological stress aspects of the microgravity component. Gamma radiation was delivered using57Co plates placed underneath the cages and a dose rate of 0.01cGy/h was used to deliver a total dose of 0.04Gy over a period of 21days to simulate a space radiation environment. For the combination group, mice were exposed to unloading and simultaneously irradiated by57Co plate placed underneath the cages. Mice from each exposure condition were then allowed a post exposure period of 7days, 1month, or 4months, following which mice were euthanized and retinas were collected and frozen. RNA and DNA libraries were constructed and used for RNA Seq and RRBS. The resulting data was deposited to GeneLab where RNA seq output was processed per NASA GeneLab RNA seq pipeline52, and RRBS results are available in the form of raw sequencing reads. Unnormalized RNA seq counts and raw RRBS FastQ files were downloaded from GeneLab and used for the current analysis.\n\nUnnormalized RNA seq counts were downloaded from GeneLab. Out of a total of 59 samples (Supplementary TableS1), three were excluded from expression analysis due to low RNA integrity number values or high ribosomal RNA contamination. These counts were generated with GeneLab RNA seq consensus pipeline, which includes quality control, read trimming, mapping, and gene quantification steps. Full details of the pipeline including the parameters used for each individual tool have been previously published52. RNA seq counts were subsequently analyzed withDESeq2(v1.30.1)53where counts were first normalized using the median of ratios method followed by differential gene expression analysis comparing each experimental group to the corresponding post exposure time point matched control group. Differentially expressed genes were determined using cutoffs of 0.263 and 0.05 for log2(fold change) and Benjamini Hochberg adjustedp value, respectively, to be consistent with analyses of brain and spleen tissues from the same set of mice6,12. R packagesggplot254,ComplexHeatmap55andpheatmap56were used for visualization and generating heatmaps.\n\nRaw RRBS reads were downloaded from GeneLab and processed with nf core/methylseq pipeline (https://github.com/nf core/methylseq; v1.6.1 accessed on June 23rd, 2021). In short,FastQC(http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc) was used for running quality checks on reads, adapter sequences were trimmed usingTrim Galore! for Cutadapt57without the rrbsoption as recommended for NuGEN RRBS Ovation kit, NuGEN's diversity trimming script was run, andBismark58was used for alignment and methylation call extraction. Deduplication based on overlapping coordinates was skipped as it is not recommended for RRBS59. Two samples were excluded from methylation analysis due to GC content bias. Mean Phred quality score across each base position in the read was confirmed to be>=20 (Supplementary Fig.4), andMethylKit(v1.16.1)60was used for detection of differentially methylated loci with a cutoff of 0.05 and 10% for a sliding linear model adjustedp value61and magnitude of methylation difference, respectively11. As a complementary approach, methylation differences were also calculated over 100 bp tiling windows to obtain differentially methylated regions60. Sites and regions were mapped to known genes (mm10 assembly) and known CpG islands usinggenomation62andGenomicRanges63packages. Promoter regions were defined as 2 kbp upstream and downstream of annotated transcription start sites. Differentially methylated genes were defined as genes containing at least one DML or DMR within their promoter region or gene body. For determination of overlap between differential expression and methylation, no thresholds for fold change or methylation difference were used to allow for genes with modest, but still significant (adjustedp value<=0.05), changes to be observed.\n\nGSEA for gene expression and over representation analysis for methylation were conducted with theClusterProfiler(v3.18,1) package64against the biological process GO category usinggseGOandenrichGOfunctions, and against KEGG pathways usingenrichKEGG. Wald test statistics fromDESeq2differential gene expression analysis were used to rank genes for enrichment analysis. Appropriate background gene lists were created by selecting all genes expressed in the retina or covered by at least one CpG site (within+/ 2kb of the gene) for expression (GSEA) and methylation (ORA) data, respectively. A Benjamini Hochberg adjustedp value cutoff of 0.05 was used for selecting enriched terms.REVIGO65was used for reducing significant biological processes to a representative non redundant set of terms. ORA was performed separately on hypo and hypermethylated genes to obtain significantly enriched GO biological processes (adjustedp value<=0.05) based on differential methylation in each group. Following adjustments were made to GSEA and ORA to allow for the discovery of overlapping candidate processes and genes between expression and methylation that can be further validated: (a) differentially methylated genes were defined as genes with their promoter or gene body containing a DML (adjustedp value<=0.05, |methylation difference|>=10%) or DMR (adjustedp value<=0.05, |methylation difference|>=2%); regulated methylation targets are routinely clustered into short genomic regions66and a lower threshold for methylation difference in DMR (2%) is recommended for enrichment analysis since perturbed processes can be a cumulative effect of multiple DMR with small effects67, and (b) an adjustedp value cutoff of 0.25 was used for detecting overlapping biological processes based on differential methylation and expression; GSEA guidelines recommend a 25% false discovery rate (FDR) for exploratory analyses as a more stringent threshold can exclude significant results even before they can be validated68.Enrichr69andToppGene70were used for disease term and functional enrichment analysis.",
    "results": "Post exposure timepoints had different global expression patterns that were visible in principal component analysis where samples clustered more closely based on time point/age of mice instead of the exposure condition (Supplementary Fig.1A). For both gene expression and methylation, each experimental group (Supplementary TableS1) was compared to a control group (no radiation or HLU) with matched post exposure duration, and significant differential expression was identified in eight out of the nine comparisons (Table1, Fig.1A,B). While the samples clustered by time point/age based on global gene expression, they could be separated by exposure condition within each time point when genes were selected based on differential expression (Supplementary Fig.1B, Fig.1B).\n\nNumber of differentially expressed genes and differentially methylated genes across exposure groups.\n\nDEG (|log2(fold change)|>=0.263 and adjustedp value<=0.05) and DMG (genes containing CpG loci or regions with |percent methylation difference|>=10 and adjustedp value<=0.05) are listed in bold for each experimental group compared to its matched control.

The 275 DEG identified in 7 days IR were enriched in ocular disease terms (Supplementary TableS2) whereas the 71 DEG identified in HLU alone had no significant enrichment of disease pathways. In the 1 month IR group, 7 out of the 31 DEG showed>twofold change (down regulated:Pon1, Sult1c1, Ermn, Stra6, Tmem72, Gm24514;up regulated:Bc1).Stra6andPon1are known to be involved in microphthalmia and diabetic retinopathy, respectively andBc1affects vascular development14and structural plasticity15.Prss56, a gene implicated in human and murine refractive development and myopia16, was the only DEG at 4months after exposure to IR alone.\n\nThe highest number of DEG within HLU+IR (combination of hindlimb unloading and irradiation) was detected at 1month post exposure with no DEG at 7days. The 64 DEG at 1month included 20 genes with enrichment (adjustedp value 8.24e 08) in thesomatodendritic compartmentof the neuron where synaptic inputs are received and integrated, and 15 genes known to be targets ofmmu miR 466, a miRNA that regulates age related macular degeneration (AMD)17(Supplementary TableS3).\n\nNine DEG were common between the HLU only and IR only groups at 7days (down regulated:Arl2bp, Chrna6, Egln1, Map2k1, Stmn2; up regulated:Ccn2, Mbd6, Sox9, St6galnac2, Zfp36l1) (Fig.1C).Bc1andPgk1were significantly up regulated in all exposure groups at 1month. Zinc finger proteinZc3h11awas significantly down regulated in the HLU only group at 7days but up regulated at 1month.Zc3h11aexpression has been shown to be altered in the murine retina and sclera in an experimental myopia mouse model18. Only a single common DEG was observed between the HLU+IR and HLU groups at 4months (mt Co2; up regulated).mt Co2is in the mitochondrial inner membrane and is an essential subunit of cytochrome c oxidase, the terminal component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain19. An integrated analysis of mammalian spaceflight data has reported the kidney to show an induction ofmt Co220.\n\nThe 1 month HLU+IR group showed the highest total number (957) of differentially methylated loci (DML) and regions (DMR) in known genes (Table1, Fig.2A). In all exposure groups, hypermethylation was more frequent than hypomethylation. Among the hypermethylated loci, a higher proportion of methylation differences were associated with CpG shores than with islands except in all three exposures at 4months (Fig.2A). Conversely, more hypomethylated loci overlapped with CpG islands than with shores in most of the groups except in all three groups at 7days. The exposure groups at 4months contained a higher proportion of total DML within CpG islands than shores compared to the other time points. Top 1% DML (roughly equivalent to methylation difference>=20%; Supplementary Fig.2) within CpG islands and exclusive to 4months post exposure were found in 17 genes across HLU (hypo:Utp14a; hyper:Dlgap3), IR (hypo:Gm7855, Rtn4rl2; hyper:Maz, Shank3), and HLU+IR (hypo:Bag3; hyper:Aspdh, Map7d1,Map7d2, Morc4, Pcdh1, Pdzd11, Pik3ap1, Rtn4rl2, Suv39h1, Xk).\n\nDifferential methylation in exposure groups. (A) Total number of differentially methylated loci and regions within genes with hyper  or hypo methylation in each exposure group categorized by whether they overlap with known CpG islands or shores.(B)Pairwise correlation plots for common differentially methylated sites. Differentially methylated loci (DML) with an adjustedp value<=0.05 were selected from each of the nine groups and pairwise correlation for methylation difference was plotted for any given pair. The diagonal shows distribution of methylation difference (%) between exposure and matched control group. Pearson correlation value and significance are displayed on the right of the diagonal, and scatter plots with methylation differences for common DML from any two given groups are displayed on the left. Only significant correlations (>3 shared DML andp value<=0.05) are displayed.(C)Upset plot showing differentially methylated genes (DMG), defined as genes with their promoter or gene body containing a DML or DMR (adjustedp value<=0.05, |methylation difference|>=10%), shared between at least two of the nine groups. The Y axis represents the number of genes in a given intersection set. The X axis lists different intersection sets and is ordered by the number of intersecting groups in a given set. Dots are colored by exposure condition (magenta for IR, green for HLU, orange for combination). R packageMethylKitwas used for differential methylation analysis,genomationandGenomicRangeswere used for annotation of DML, andggplot2,ggpairsandComplexUpsetwere used for visualization.DML/R/Gdifferentially methylated loci/region/gene,HLUhindlimb unloading,IRirradiation.\n\nPairwise analysis of all methylated loci in genes were compared across our 9 exposure groups (Fig.2B). The highest correlation in methylation difference across different exposures was observed at the same post exposure time point. Hypermethylation ofBclaf3promoter was observed in four groups (~15% in 1m HLU, 4m IR and 4m HLU+IR, and 26% in 1m HLU+IR), and another CpG island inTmc8promoter was common across all three exposure groups at 7days (10% hypermethylation). The top DMLs shared across all three exposures were inCav2at 7days (30% hypermethylation),Grip2at 1month (20% hypermethylation), andSorbs2at 4months (8% hypermethylation).\n\nA number of genes containing DML or DMR were observed in multiple exposure groups and post exposure time points (Fig.2C).Bcl11b, Bclaf3, Gse1, Necab2, PlecandTafa5were each differentially methylated in five out of the nine groups. Six genes (Adamts5, Gse1, Rbm15b, Fscn2, Satb1, Tenm3) were shared across different time points after radiation exposure, withAdamts5andFscn2promoters being hypermethylated even after 4months of exposure to radiation alone. The promoter region ofPcdh19,a protocadherin, was hypermethylated (>20% methylation difference) at all three time points for HLU+IR and also in HLU alone at 7days.Bclaf3was hypermethylated in five groups (HLU at 7days and 1month, HLU+IR at 1month and 4months, and IR and 4months), and CpG islands inHmgb3promoter were hypermethylated in HLU and HLU+IR at both, 7days and 1month.\n\nThe top BP significantly enriched across all conditions 7days after exposure includedmorphogenesis of epithelium,ATP metabolism, andnucleotide metabolism(Fig.3A, Supplementary TableS4). Processes related toepithelial morphogenesiswere activated in the exposure groups, whereas all other processes were suppressed across the three conditions. All shared processes were activated in the 1 month groups, with the exception ofaxon guidanceandcell junction assembly, which were suppressed in the radiation only group. Common processes in the 1 month groups were related toamine transport,regulation of membrane potential,synaptic vesicle exocytosis, andneurotransmitter transport. At 4months post exposure, the top processes shared across the three exposure conditions were suppressed. These includedlens development in camera type eye, wound healing, angiogenesis,andsulfur compound metabolic process.\n\nCommon biological processes enriched in different exposure groups and at different time points.(A)Top 20 significantly enriched BP common across all exposure conditions for a given time point.(B)Significantly enriched BP common across all time points for a given exposure condition. Size of each point represents magnitude of normalized enrichment score (NES) while the color indicates activation (red) or suppression (blue) of the BP in the given exposure group compared to time point matched controls. The Y axis provides a description of common GO BP and the X axis lists the ratio of genes that belong to a given gene set to the total number of genes in the gene set.ClusterProfilerwas used for gene set enrichment analysis and the R packageggplot2was used for visualization.BPbiological processes,HLUhindlimb unloading,IRirradiation,NESnormalized enrichment score.\n\nProcesses that were significantly enriched at all post exposure time points for a given exposure condition were evaluated (Fig.3B, Supplementary TableS4).Nucleotide metabolismwas suppressed at 7days and 4months but activated at 1month in mice subjected to microgravity alone, whereasepithelial tube morphogenesisandlens developmentwere activated at 7days but suppressed at all later time points, anddetection of light stimuluswas suppressed at 7days and subsequently activated at 1month and 4months.Retina homeostasiswas suppressed in the radiation only groups at 7days and 1month but activated at 4months,eye morphogenesiswas activated at 7days and suppressed subsequently, andsynaptic vesicle endocytosiswas suppressed at 7days but activated at all later time points. In the combination groups,postsynapse assemblywas activated at all time points,nucleotide metabolismwas activated only at 1month, andRho signal transductionwas activated at 7days and 1month followed by suppression at 4months.Nucleotide metabolismand related processes were significantly enriched in all nine groups with consistent activation at 1month and suppression at 7days and 4months.Pdk1was within the gene set fornucleotide metabolismprocesses across all nine groups, and its expression was decreased at 7days and 4months but increased at 1month in all exposure groups (Supplementary Fig.3).Pdk1is a kinase known to play a key role in regulation of glucose and fatty acid metabolism, and is involved in cellular response to hypoxia21.\n\nAs a complementary approach to examining shared processes, BP exclusive to each exposure condition (enriched in>=2 post exposure time points), or exclusive to each post exposure time point were also examined (Table2, Supplementary TableS5). Processes related to microtubule dynamics were enriched exclusively in HLU alone. IR specific BP includedDNA conformation changes,Golgi organization,protein DNA complex assembly, andtype I interferon response. The BP activated exclusively in IR but not enriched in HLU+IR at 7days includedresponse to wounding, innate immune response, regulation of interleukin 6 production, heart morphogenesis, lipid metabolism,andepithelial cell proliferation. The processes suppressed exclusively in IR were related totelomere organization, DNA repair, ncRNA metabolism, detection of light stimulus,andorganelle localization by membrane tethering. Lastly, BP exclusive to HLU+IR werepostsynaptic density organizationandregulation of AMPA receptors. Each post exposure time point was associated with distinct BP enriched across multiple conditions only at the given time point. At 7days, BP related toproteasomal protein catabolismwere suppressed in all groups, andmammary gland morphogenesiswas activated in IR and HLU+IR. Oncogenesis in the retina and breast have been linked by the regulation of cyclin D122; the gene encoding cyclin D1,Ccnd1, was significantly up regulated 7days after exposure to IR but was not differentially expressed at the later time points.mRNA catabolic process(suppressed) andion transmembrane transport(activated) were among the BP exclusive to 1month post exposure. At 4months,glycerolipid metabolism,pigmentation, andbrown fat cell differentiationwere suppressed.\n\nRepresentative biological processes enriched exclusively under each exposure condition or timepoint.\n\nREVIGOwas used for reducing significant biological processes (adjustedp value<=0.05) exclusive to each exposure condition (HLU, IR, HLU+IR) or timepoint (7d, 1m, 4m) to representative non redundant terms.\n\nOver representation analysis (ORA) was applied separately to hypo  and hypermethylated genes, and only the hypermethylated genes resulted in significantly over represented processes (Supplementary TableS6). ORA is conducted by iteratively counting the number of genes shared between a preselected input gene set (e.g., genes differentially methylated based on cutoffs for significance and magnitude of change) and each annotated gene set (e.g., all genes in a GO category), and applying a hypergeometric test to determine the statistical significance of the overlap23. Since all the groups showed differential methylation in a sizable set of genes compared to differential expression, ORA was suitable for methylation whereas gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was more appropriate for gene expression as it does not require an arbitrary cutoff for selecting significant genes. All genes overlapping with at least one covered CpG site were used as the gene background for ORA. Using a Benjamini Hochberg adjustedp value of 0.05 as the cutoff, nine processes were enriched in 4 month HLU+IR and includedregulation of Wnt signaling,neurogenesis, nervous system development, cell projection organization, cell surface receptor signaling, pattern specification processandmorphogenesis of a polarized epithelium.Genes with hypermethylation and involved in the regulation of these processes included oncogenes and tumor suppressors such asWnt3, Trp53, Trp73, Sox10, Rap1gap, Paqr3, KitandBex1.The promoter region of the brain expressed X linked gene,Bex1, contained four hypermethylated sites overlapping a CpG island. The gene has been reported to show promoter hypermethylation in malignant glioma cell line specimens24. Analysis based on KEGG pathways also showed an enrichment forWnt signaling(raw and adjustedp value of 0.005 and 0.3, respectively). Only one other group, 1 month HLU, showed over representation for a biological process at an adjustedp value cutoff of 0.05 (actin filament based process).\n\nA total of 23 genes showed changes in expression and methylation at an adjustedp value cutoff of 0.05 (Table3).Eef1a1, a protein involved in peptide chain elongation, was down regulated and hypomethylated in groups exposed to radiation or microgravity 7days post exposure. CrystallinCrybb3and signal induced proliferation associatedSipa1l3,both implicated in cataract, were up regulated and hypermethylated 7days after exposure to IR or HLU, respectively. Fibroblast growth factor 1 (Fgfr1) has been known to mediate photoreceptor rescue effect in response to retinal injury25, and the gene was up regulated and hypomethylated 7days after radiation.Ncor2, a gene in the Notch signaling pathway, was up regulated with hypermethylation in the gene body in 7days IR. PlectinPlec, a cytolinker protein involved in cytoskeletal organization, was up regulated and hypermethylated. FilaminFlnbwas also up regulated and hypermethylated and is known to be involved in microvascular development26. No common differentially expressed and methylated genes were found in any of the exposure groups at 4months.\n\nGenes with statistically significant expression and methylation changes.\n\nGenes that are differentially expressed in a given group (adjustedp value<=0.05) and also contain at least one differentially methylated locus or region (adjustedp value<=0.05) are listed.

The highest number of overlapping processes were observed in 4 months HLU+IR, withWnt signaling pathwaybeing one of the shared BP.Actin filament based processwas enriched in 1 month HLU and 4 months HLU+IR based on both, differential expression and methylation. Processes related toion transmembrane transportwere activated in the 1 month HLU+IR group. Shared genes included ephrinEphb2, which is also dysregulated in the murine brain following hindlimb unloading6.

    "discussion": "Spaceflight is an environment to which Earth based biological systems have not yet adapted. Changes in gravity as well as radiation exposure that differs from terrestrial radiation both in terms of intensity and type, are the two primary naturally occurring hazards the human body contends with during space travel. It is crucial to characterize the impacts of these hazards to ensure the crew and NASA as an agency are appropriately informed. While hazards will be experienced concurrently in spaceflight, important information about the potential interactions between hazards can reveal how impacts can be appropriately mitigated. Different countermeasure strategies will need to be employed if hazards modulate similar or divergent processes.\n\nIt is important to note the current study leverages data from a previously performed animal study where mice were exposed to gamma rays and microgravity as analogs of space radiation and microgravity respectively. However, even with the inherent limitations of using analogs, the observed results still provide insights on processes related to retinal dysfunction due to individual and combined exposures, at different time points, allowing us to gain a preliminary understanding of longitudinal changes. Compared to expression results from other tissue types collected in accompanying studies, spleen data from 7days post exposure showed highest number of DEG in HLU alone12, brain data from 4months had most DEGs in HLU+IR6, whereas the retina results presented here showed DEGs peaked in IR alone at 7days, and HLU+IR at 1month. Combined stressors can induce complex responses further regulated by factors such as radiation type, post exposure duration, and tissue type. Given the conflicting results from various studies addressing synergies between microgravity and radiation and their impact on DNA damage repair and cellular repair27, further work is needed to understand their interplay.\n\nBiological processes shared across, or exclusive to, exposure conditions and post exposure stages were identified (Fig.1, Table2, Supplementary TableS5), andnucleotide metabolismwas enriched in all the groups with activation at 1month, suppression at 7days and even lower at 4months for all exposures. The suppression of nucleotide metabolism has been shown to play a role in the establishment and maintenance of the stable growth arrest of oncogene induced senescence28. Further work is required to understand the mechanism behind the activation at 1month with a return to being suppressed at 4months, and the specific role ofPdk1in process modulation.\n\nSeveral genes known to be implicated in ocular diseases were found to be impacted at the transcriptomic and epigenomic levels. A subset of the 7 days radiation only DEG (Cryaa, Cryba1, Cryba2, Cryba4, Crybb1, Crybb2, Crybb3, Crygs, Bsfp1) were enriched innuclear and congenital cataracts, however, these genes were not dysregulated at 1month or 4months. A key component of the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway,Map2k1, was down regulated in the IR and HLU+IR groups at 7days but up regulated at 1month; MAPK signaling has been shown to be involved in AMD pathogenesis29.Bc1, a non coding RNA known to affect vascular development14and structural plasticity15was significantly up regulated in all three exposures at 1month. Four months after radiation, retention of hypermethylation was observed in genes involved in eye development and pathogenesis includingMyc associated zinc finger transcription factorMaz30,disintegrinAdamts5involved in AMD,andFscn2with a role in photoreceptor disk morphogenesis. Interestingly,Adamts5was previously observed to be dysregulated in the murine retina after spaceflight11.Additionally, early differential methylation (only at 7days and 1month) was observed inHmgb3,a member of the high mobility group superfamily and a transcription factor known to be impacted by spaceflight10.\n\nA total of 23 genes shared differential expression and methylation (Table3). Of these, 14 had differential methylation in the promoter region and 9 in the gene body with negative correlation between expression and methylation changes in 3 and 6 genes, respectively. The rest showed a positive correlation. Recent studies have expanded the understanding of effects of DNA methylation on gene expression, especially in cancers31.Along with the traditional methylation induced gene silencing, there have been patterns of consistently positive or negative correlations for all CpG sites associated with specific genes. More work is needed to understand the variation in the impact of DNA methylation on expression across different tissue and cell types, genes, and the location of CpG sites. High mobility group containingSox9is known to be involved in retinogenesis32and was up regulated in 7 days HLU and IR groups, and hypomethylated in 7 days HLU.Ppm1ahas been shown to play a crucial role in the wound healing inflammation angiogenesis axis in mice33, and was down regulated and hypermethylated 7days after radiation but not later.Sphk1plays a key role in the regulation of inflammatory responses34;Sphkap, a modulator ofSphk1, was up regulated and hypermethylated in 1 month HLU+IR. The glycoproteinB4galt6regulates astrocyte activation during CNS inflammation35and was up regulated and hypomethylated.Interestingly,Sphk1and glycoproteinsB4galt2andB4galt3were also up regulated in 7days HLU+IR based on spleen data from the same set of mice12. Transcriptional co repressorTle3, involved in Wnt and Notch signaling pathways, was up regulated and hypermethylated in 1 month HLU+IR.\n\nBiological processes related toWnt signaling pathwaywere significantly enriched in multiple groups based on differential expression, with activation in IR and HLU+IR at 7days, and suppression in 1 month HLU and all three exposures at 4months.Wnt signaling pathwayis critically involved in cell cell communication and regulates tissue homeostasis36,37. Altered activities may promote tissue degeneration38. Wnt signaling plays a role in eye organogenesis32and genes in the pathway have been reported to be impacted by spaceflight11. The pathway has also been shown to be affected by spaceflight in 3D cultured neural stem cells39and human cardiovascular progenitor cells40.Bclaf3has been proposed to regulate proliferation/apoptosis by suppressing Wnt signaling in the mouse gastric epithelium41, and showed hypermethylation in the promoter within four of the groups including IR and HLU+IR at 4months. Interestingly, genes involved in Wnt signaling also appeared as members in processes enriched in 4 months HLU+IR based on methylation data (Wnt3, Wnt11, Wnt7b, Lrp6, Tnik;Supplementary TableS6).\n\nAmong the BP shared between differential methylation and expression (Table4), pathways related toWnt signalingwere also over represented in 4 months HLU+IR.Collagen fibril organizationwas over represented with three overlapping constituent genes:Col5a1encodes an alpha chain of type V collagen and the gene family forms a major component of the basement membrane of the corneal endothelium and related genes were altered in the mouse retina after spaceflight11, lysyl oxidase likeLoxl1has been implicated in pseudoexfoliation syndrome which is a major cause of glaucoma and cardiovascular complications42, andCompplays a role in vascular wall remodeling43.Actin filament based processwas enriched in 1 month HLU and 4 months HLU+IR. Some of the gene members based on differential methylation in 1 month HLU are also known to be involved insignaling by Rho GTPases (Rhoc, Rhobtb1, Arhgef10l, Cyfip2, Fmnl3, Fgd1, Iqgap3;Supplementary TableS6).Rho GTPases are key players in adaptation to microgravity and actin cytoskeleton dynamics in mammalian cells44,45.Temperature homeostasiswas enriched in 7 days HLU, and has been shown to be impacted by hindlimb suspension in a previous study where the authors noted that unloading prevented the mice from curling up at night to regulate body temperature46. This difference in temperature regulation between the control and experimental groups should be considered while designing unloading experiments and interpreting the results.\n\nInterestingly, the NASA Twins Study reportedNotch3to show epigenetic discordance based on spaceflight blood samples13and the gene was significantly up regulated (twofold change) at 7days post irradiation in the mouse retina.Rbx1andNcor2, also in the Notch signaling pathway, showed 33% hypermethylation in 4 months HLU+IR, and up regulation and hypermethylation 7days post irradiation, respectively. The NASA Twins Study also reports a decrease during flight inleucine rich alpha 2 glycoprotein 1, a protein involved in retinal vascular pathology.Lrg1was down regulated by more than fourfold (unadjustedp value=0.006) in 1 month HLU and significantly hypermethylated (16.8% methylation difference) in 4 months HLU+IR.\n\nThis multi omics murine analysis highlights changes in gene expression, DNA methylation, and regulation of biological processes exclusive to, or shared between, exposure groups at different timepoints. Furthermore, there were expressed genes and processes that only presented themselves at the 4 month time point, which may be indicative of a longer post exposure duration to understand the effects of low dose radiation and microgravity on the retina. Wnt signaling has been shown to be perturbed in the murine retina after spaceflight11and our results show discordance in the pathway in the 4 months HLU+IR group based on changes in expression and methylation.Notch3andLrg1showed discordance during flight in The NASA Twins Study blood samples13and also exhibit differential patterns in the murine retina in the current study. Hence, despite limitations mentioned below, our study provides confidence that murine models can provide an understanding of molecular mechanisms and pathways contributing to ocular function as a response to analogs for spaceflight stressors.\n\nOur study comes with limitations. First, the number of samples was limited with only a total of 59 mice. Therefore, each exposure group at each time point was limited to 3 6 mice, thus limiting power. A follow up study with more animals should be conducted to confirm these observations. Second, the animals were radiated by low dose gamma rays which do not represent space radiation. Ground based low dose gamma or x ray radiation studies are often used to study the effect of space relevant radiation exposures (in terms of total dose) on different tissues/systems6,47,48as to inform future space radiation experiments and form an initial understanding of the impacts across radiation doses and types. However, further studies should be implemented with higher dose gamma radiation and GCR simulations to leverage a more realistic space radiation analog. Third, a key limitation of applying bulk RNA Seq and RRBS to a complex tissue such as the retina with~140 cell types49is that the approach averages signals over heterogeneous cell types at different transcriptomic states. As a result, true perturbations in, or correlation between, expression and methylation in a small cell population can be obscured by aggregated profiles. Fourth, caution is needed while comparing results between this study and The NASA Twins Study as biospecimen type and analysis time points differ between studies, and correlating time points across species with such different lifespans is challenging. Therefore, it is important to note that this analysis with its limitations only provides a preliminary signal for further investigation into understanding the longitudinal effect of spacelight hazard analogs on retina.\n\nOverall, the results of this study support the development of a more robust understanding of the longitudinal molecular mechanisms implicated in the murine retina response to low dose gamma irradiation and simulated microgravity. Further investigation into the interplay between these mechanisms and validation of results in multiple models may provide insights into key pathways with translational potential across biological systems and exposure types as well as targets for mitigation strategies.",
