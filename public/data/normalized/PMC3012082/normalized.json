    "abstract": "The prevailing paradigm ofSalmonellaenteropathogenesis based on monolayers asserts thatSalmonellapathogenicity island 1 Type Three Secretion System (SPI 1 T3SS) is required for bacterial invasion into intestinal epithelium. However, little is known about the role of SPI 1 in mediating gastrointestinal disease in humans. Recently, SPI 1 deficient nontyphoidalSalmonellastrains were isolated from infected humans and animals, indicating that SPI 1 is not required to cause enteropathogenesis and demonstrating the need for morein vivo like models. Here, we utilized a previously characterized 3 D organotypic model of human intestinal epithelium to elucidate the role of all characterizedSalmonella entericaT3SSs. Similar toin vivoreports, theSalmonellaSPI 1 T3SS was not required to invade 3 D intestinal cells. Additionally,Salmonellastrains carrying single (SPI 1 or SPI 2), double (SPI 1/2) and complete T3SS knockout (SPI 1/SPI 2:flhDC) also invaded 3 D intestinal cells to wildtype levels. Invasion of wildtype and TTSS mutants was aSalmonellaactive process, whereas non invasive bacterial strains, bacterial size beads, and heat killedSalmonelladid not invade 3 D cells. Wildtype and T3SS mutants did not preferentially target different cell types identified within the 3 D intestinal aggregates, including M cells/M like cells, enterocytes, or Paneth cells. Moreover, each T3SS was necessary for substantial intracellular bacterial replication within 3 D cells. Collectively, these results indicate that T3SSs are dispensable forSalmonellainvasion into highly differentiated 3 D models of human intestinal epithelial cells, but are required for intracellular bacterial growth, parallelingin vivoinfection observations and demonstrating the utility of these models in predictingin vivo like pathogenic mechanisms.",
    "methods": "Bacterial strains used in this study are described inTable S1. All bacterial strains were grown in Lennox broth (L broth) as described below[82]. The human colonic epithelial cell line, HT 29, was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)[32],[83],[84]. The cells were cultured in a specialized growth medium comprised of a triple sugar minimal essential medium alpha L 15 base supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, designated as GTSF 2[85], and incubated at 37 degreesC at 5% CO2environment.\n\nAntibodies against specified antigens were obtained from the following sources: Sialyl Lewis A (MC 551; Kamiya), polyclonalSalmonellaO antisera (BD Difco), monoclonalSalmonellaantibody (MAI 83451; Affinity Bioreagents), syndecan 1 (MCA681T; AbD seroTec), Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) (ab58375; Abcam), ITF goblet cell marker (15C6; Santa Cruz), and Alexa Fluor 633 phalloidin (A22284; Invitrogen). Fluoresbrite plain YG 2.00 micron microspheres (fluorescent beads) were obtained from Polysciences, Inc. (18338). For mammalian cell viability, 0.4% trypan blue (Sigma) was used at a 11 ratio with cells suspended in cell culture media.\n\nThe development of 3 D intestinal tissue models was performed as previously described[31],[32]. In brief, HT 29 epithelial cells were initially grown as monolayers in tissue culture flasks, trypsinized, and resuspended in fresh medium at a density of 2x106cells/ml. Cells were then introduced into RWV bioreactors (Synthecon, Inc.) together with collagen coated Cytodex 3 microcarrier beads (Pharmacia), resulting in a final ratio of 10 cells/bead[85]. Cells were cultured in the RWV bioreactors in GTSF 2 at 37 degreesC and 5% CO2with rotation at 20 rpm. Fresh medium was replenished after 5 days and then every 24 hours thereafter until harvest of the cultures at 18 23 days.\n\nHT 29 monolayers were grown in GTSF 2 medium in a 24 well plate at a concentration of 1.2 million cells/plate. For 3 D aggregates, cells were harvested from the bioreactor and seeded into 24 well plates at a concentration of 19 million cells/plate. For infections, all bacterial strains were grown shaking overnight in L broth medium at 37 degreesC. Bacteria were back diluted 1200 and grown with aeration until the bacterial growth reached OD 600 of 0.8. Bacteria were washed twice with Dulbecco's PBS (D PBS) and used to infect mammalian cells at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 10 for 1 h, whereupon infected cells were washed three times with D PBS and incubated in medium containing 100 ug/ml gentamicin for 3 hour. The cells were then washed three times with D PBS and fresh medium containing 7.5 ug/ml gentamicin was added. At indicated times post infection (p.i.), media was removed, cells were washed with PBS, lysed with 500 ul of 0.1% Triton X 100, and a fraction of the lysate was plated on L agar to enumerate colony forming units (CFU). For heat killedSalmonellastudies, bacteria were taken from the back dilutedSalmonellacultures, washed 3 times with D PBS, resuspended in D PBS, heated at 90 degreesC for 30 minutes, and used to infect mammalian cells as with liveSalmonella.\n\nThe 3 D aggregates were harvested from the bioreactor and seeded in a 24 well plate at a concentration of approximately 19 million cells/plate. Infections were done either using same protocol as invasion/intracellular growth assays described above, or an established protocol described by Mortimeret al., which allows for a shorter and synchronized infection[56]. In brief,Salmonellaovernight cultures grown in LB shaking at 37 degreesC were back diluted 1200 in LB and grown shaking until they reached an OD of 1.2. Bacteria were washed 2 times in D PBS and used to infect mammalian cells at an m.o.i. of 10 for 5 minutes, whereupon host cells washed 3 times and media was replaced with media containing 100 ug/ml gentamicin. At indicated times p.i., 3 D aggregates were fixed in 4.0% paraformaldehyde in D PBS for 30 minutes at room temperature. For staining, cells were washed three times with 0.1% Triton X 100 in PBS and blocked for 1 hour with blocking buffer (D PBS, 0.1% Triton X 100, 1% BSA). Blocking buffer with primary antibody (concentration antibody dependent) was added to the cells for 1 hour at 37 degreesC. Cells were then rinsed three times with D PBS and incubated for 1 hour with secondary antibody diluted 11000 in blocking buffer. Aggregates were rinsed with D PBS and mounted with Pro Long Gold Anti fade with DAPI (Invitrogen). Samples were analyzed with the Carl Zeiss 510 Inverted confocal microscope using a 100x objective and ZEN Light Edition 2009 software. Quantitation ofSalmonellacolocalization with the various host markers was determined by fixing cells at indicated times p.i., staining the cells with the designated host andSalmonellaspecific antibodies, then counting the number of bacteria that localized with the markers per 35 50 bacteria in at least three independent experiments. For differential immunofluorescence staining of extracellular and intracellular bacteria, infections were carried out as described above in the bacterial invasion and intracellular growth assays section and staining was done as described in results section and in published reports[46].\n\nData sets in triplicate were analyzed using Microsoft Excel software to calculate the Student's unpaired t test for independent samples. P values of <0.05 (*) and <0.001 (**) were considered significant and highly significant, respectively.",
    "results": "In previous reports from our lab utilizing classic gentamicin invasion assays, we showed that aSalmonella invAmutant that is defective for invading monolayers, exhibited wildtype levels of invasion into 3 D HT 29 colon cells[32],[43].InvAis encoded by SPI 1 and is essential in the formation of the T3SS needle. However, SPI 1 encodes for numerous other genes aside frominvAthat are involved in bacterial invasion and virulence[2]. To investigate if alternative SPI 1 encoded effector protein(s) are potentially responsible forSalmonellainvasion into 3 D intestinal cells, we infected HT 29 monolayers and 3 D aggregates with either aSalmonellamutant lacking theinvAgene or a mutant lacking the entire SPI 1 encoding region (Figure 2A). TheinvAmutant and the SPI 1 mutant both invaded 3 D HT 29 cells to higher levels compared to monolayers. These data suggest that SPI 1, a virulence factor previously identified to be required forSalmonellainvasion of epithelial cells grown as monolayers[9],[44], is not mandatory for invasion into our well differentiated 3 D intestinal epithelial cells.\n\nA) HT 29 monolayers (black bars) and 3 D aggregates (grey bars) infected with wildtype, invA, SPI 1, SPI 2, and SPI 1/2Salmonellamutants for 1 hour at an m.o.i. of 10. To measure bacterial invasion, host cells were lysed at 3 hpi and intracellular bacteria were enumerated and plotted as CFU obtained for each bacterium. B) Three dimensional HT 29 cells were infected as in (A), fixed at 3 hpi, stained with aSalmonellamonoclonal antibody (extracellular bacteria), washed, permeabilized, stained with aSalmonellapolyclonal antibody (extracellular and intracellular bacteria), and imaged by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. Percentages represent number of bacteria out of 50 bacteria that stained with the monoclonal antibody pre permeabilization (grey bars) or the remaining bacteria that stained with the polyclonal antibody and not the monoclonal antibody post permeabilization (black bars). C) Representative single image from z stack confocal immunofluorescence microscopy images (100x objective) of 3 D HT 29 aggregates exposed to red fluorescent beads (2 um) for 1 hour, washed, fixed 3 hours post exposure, and stained with phalloidin antibody to visualize host cell actin (green). D) HT 29 monolayers (black bars) and 3 D aggregates (grey bars) infected with wildtypeSalmonella, SPI 1/2Salmonella,E. coli,andB. subtilisfor 1 hour at an m.o.i. of 10. To measure bacterial invasion, host cells were lysed at 3 hpi and intracellular bacteria were enumerated and plotted as CFU obtained for each bacterium. E) HT 29 monolayers (black bars) and 3 D aggregates (grey bars) infected with wildtype, SPI 1/2, flhDC, SPI 1/2:flhDC Salmonellamutants for 1 hour at an m.o.i. of 10. To measure bacterial invasion, host cells were lysed at 3 hpi and intracellular bacteria were enumerated and plotted as CFU obtained for each bacterium. Data represents the average of at least three independent experiments from separate batches of cells (N=3). Limit of detection is 10 CFU. * and ** indicate statistical significance ofp<0.05 and 0.001, respectively, comparing 3 D aggregates to monolayers for each bacterial strain.\n\nWe next wanted to test the hypothesis that the second T3SS encoded by SPI 2 and/or its encoded effectors were potentially compensating for the loss of SPI 1, thereby aiding in the invasion ofSalmonellainto the 3 D cells. To address this question, we infected HT 29 monolayers and 3 D cells with a SPI 2 deletion mutant and a SPI 1/SPI 2 double mutant (Figure 2A). The double mutant was still able to invade 3 D cells to significantly higher levels compared to monolayers, and to similar levels observed for SPI 1 and SPI 2 mutants in 3 D cells. Overall, these data demonstrate that unlike monolayers,Salmonellacan invade the morein vivo like 3 D cells in the absence of SPI 1 and SPI 2 T3SSs and their encoded effectors. However, the SPI 1 and SPI 2 genomic regions do contribute to a more productive invasion, as wildtypeSalmonellaexhibited significantly higher levels of invasion compared to the T3SS mutants in 3 D cells.\n\nThree dimensional HT 29 cells were previously shown to secrete mucus, which could cause bacteria to adhere to the surface of the cells and not actually be localized intracellularly[32]. Thus, to further validate that wildtype and the SPI 1 mutant are indeed localized inside 3 D HT 29 cells, we performed a differential immunofluorescence microscopy staining technique that allows one to distinguish between extra  and intracellular bacteria[45],[46]. Three dimensional HT 29 cells were infected with wildtype andSalmonellaSPI 1 and SPI 1/2 mutants as in (A), fixed, and stained with a monoclonal anti Salmonellaantibody that will bind only extracellular bacteria. After addition of corresponding secondary antibody, cells were washed, permeabilized, and stained with a polyclonalSalmonellaantibody that can bind to intracellular and extracellular bacteria as a result of host cell membrane permeabilization (Figure S1). Three dimensional cells were visualized by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy and the bacteria that only stained with the monoclonal antibody (pre permeabilization/extracellular bacteria) were counted out of 50 total bacteria (stained with both antibodies) in at least three independent experiments (Figure 2B). A majority of the wildtype andSalmonellaT3SS mutants were localized intracellularly (>60% of total bacteria counted), and no significant difference in bacterial localization was observed between wildtype and T3SS mutants, further demonstrating thatSalmonellacan invade into 3 D HT 29 cells in the absence of SPI 1 and SPI 2 T3SSs.\n\nAs shown,SalmonellaSPI 1 and 2 T3SSs mutants can invade 3 D HT 29 cells; however, we wanted to investigate ifSalmonellawas entering 3 D HT 29 cells through non specific cellular uptake and not aSalmonellaactive invasion mechanism. To test if 3 D cells are capable of particle uptake, we introduced bacterial sized fluorescent beads to the cells under the identical experimental conditions used for ourSalmonellainfection assays. Three hours post bead exposure; cells were fixed, stained with phalloidin to visualize host cell actin cytoskeleton, and imaged by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy (Figure 2C). The only beads observed were those that appeared to be extracellular in localization. The extracellular localization was further confirmed by z stack confocal immunofluorescence microscopy (Figure S2).\n\nNext we wanted to investigate if bacterial surface component(s) and/or bacterial active process(s) are required to be present for cellular uptake. We thus infected 3D HT 29 cells with non invasive Gram negativeE. coliand Gram positiveB. subtilisstrains, which represent bacteria that have very different surface structures and do not posses mechanisms necessary for host cell invasion. Three hours post infection, we observed no intracellular bacteria by gentamicin survival assay or confocal microscopy (Figure 2Dand data not shown). These data suggest that either an invasion mechanism is necessary for internalization, or alternatively, aSalmonellaspecific surface component/structure is triggeringSalmonellainternalization by 3 D HT 29 cells. To determine between these two possibilities, monolayer and 3 D HT 29 cells were infected with heat killed wildtypeSalmonellafor 1 hour, washed, and fixed. Cells were stained with anti Salmonellaantibody, phalloidin, and DAPI to visualize host and bacterial nuclei, and visualized by confocal microscopy using z stack imaging. We observed no intracellularSalmonellain either monolayer or 3 D HT 29 cells (data not shown). Collectively, these data suggest thatSalmonellais actively invading 3 D HT 29 cells utilizing a mechanism(s) other than the SPI 1 or 2 encoded T3SSs.\n\nAnother possible means ofSalmonellaprotein effector secretion that could potentiate invasion and allowSalmonellaactive entry into 3 D cells is through a pore created in the bacterial membrane as a result of flagellum translocation to the surface, which occurs through a third T3SS[47],[48]. To test the hypothesis that secreted effector(s) responsible for invasion of theSalmonellaSPI 1/2 double mutant into 3 D cells is a result of the flagellum pore; we infected cells with aSalmonellamutant deficient in SPI 1, SPI 2, and the master regulators of flagellum pore formation and synthesis, FlhC and FlhD (Figure 2E). The SPI 1/SPI 2:flhDCmutant was still able to significantly invade the 3 D HT 29 aggregates, demonstrating thatSalmonellacan actively invade 3 D intestinal cells in the absence of all known/characterized T3SSs.\n\nThe work presented here is the first to report that all known T3SSs are not mandatory forSalmonellainvasion into epithelial cells, which is consistent with reports of SPI 1 deficient strains being isolated from humans with enteric salmonellosis and animal intestinal tissues[28],[49]. Moreover, aSalmonellaSPI 1 mutant has also been shown to preferentially target and invade mouse epithelial M cells and polarized epithelial cells cultured under conditions that allow them to express M cell like phenotypes, phenotypes that include particle uptake and transportation of antigens[16],[39],[41],[50],[51],[52],[53],[54]. From these studies, we hypothesized thatSalmonellaand the T3SS mutants are targeting M cells to eventually gain entry into the 3 D aggregates. To first observe if the aggregates contained M cells or M cell like cells, we stained uninfected 3 D HT 29 cells with anti sialyl Lewis A antigen antibody (M cell marker) and imaged the cells by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy (Figure 3A). Interestingly, the 3 D aggregates exhibited very similar staining and expression patterns of the M cell marker as observed in normal human colon tissue sections[55]. Specifically, the 3 D cells displayed a columnar morphology to where only the edges of >20% of the cells showed expression of the M cell marker. We next wanted to observe if wildtype and the SPI 1 mutant preferentially targeted M cells/M like cells present in the 3 D aggregates to eventually gain intracellular localization (Figure 3A). Three dimensional HT 29 cells were infected with either wildtype or theSalmonellaSPI 1 mutant for 5 minutes at an m.o.i. of 101 according to the infection protocol outlined by Steele Mortimeret al., 1999[56]. This established protocol allows for a shorter infection time, a more synchronized infection, and earlier cellular fixation periods, while maintaining the sameSalmonellaintracellular growth and trafficking profiles observed with longer and more commonly used infection protocols (Figure S3A C)[56]. WildtypeSalmonellaSPI 1 induction during the different growth conditions utilized in these studies was also analyzed, and no observable or significant differences in SPI 1 expression was seen by RT PCR and quantitative RT PCR, respectively (Figure S3D,Text S1, and data not shown). After infection, cells were fixed 5 10 mpi to capture the early stages of infection, and stained with anti sialyl Lewis A antigen antibody (M cell marker), anti Salmonellaantibody, and DAPI to visualize nuclei (Figures 3A,S4, andS5)[55]. Quantitation by confocal microscopy of the number of wildtype and SPI 1 mutant bacteria out of 50 bacteria in at least 3 independent experiments that localized to cells expressing M cell marker revealed only 20 25% of wildtype and SPI 1 mutant localized to M cells/M like cells, and similar levels were also observed with the wildtype, SPI 2, SPI 1/2, and SPI 1/2:flhDCstrains (Figure 3B). These data suggest that there is no preferential targeting of wildtypeSalmonellaand the T3SS mutants to M cells/M like cells within the 3 D aggregates.\n\nA) Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy images (100x objective) of 3 D HT 29 aggregates left uninfected or infected for 5 10 min with either the wildtype or SPI 1Salmonellamutant and stained with anti sialyl Lewis A (M cell marker) antibody (red), anti Salmonellaantibody (green), and DAPI (blue). B) Quantitation of confocal images as observed in (A) of 3 D HT 29 aggregates infected for 5 10 min with wildtype and the T3SS mutants. Percentages represent the number of bacteria localized to M cell marker/50 bacteria counted (N>=3). No significant difference was observed when comparing each bacterial strain to wildtype for each host cell marker. C) Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy images (100x objective) of 3 D HT 29 aggregates infected with aSalmonellatype 1 pili mutant (fimA H) and stained with anti sialyl Lewis A antibody (red), anti Salmonellaantibody (green), and DAPI (blue). D) HT 29 3 D aggregates infected with wildtype, fimH, and fimA H Salmonellamutants for 1 hour at an m.o.i. of 10. To measure bacterial invasion, host cells were lysed at 3 hpi and intracellular bacteria were enumerated and plotted as CFU obtained for each bacterium (N>=3).\n\nAs shown inFigure 3B,SalmonellaT3SSs are not needed for localization to 3 D HT 29 M cells/M like cells, however recent reports suggest that FimH, a component of type I pili, interacts with an M cell surface protein and this interaction is necessary forSalmonellaintestinal invasion specifically into M cells[42],[57]. To determine if the type I pili is playing a role inSalmonellatargeting and internalization into 3 D aggregates, and more specifically M cells, we infected 3 D HT 29 cells with a type I pili mutant (FimA H). Consistent with reports that type I pili is needed to bind to M cells in order to invade these cell types; we observed no co localization ofSalmonellapili mutant with the M cell marker at 5 10 mpi by confocal immunofluorescence (Figure 3C). However, both the mutant lacking entire pili (fimA H) and the mutant lacking just the adhesion portion of the pili (fimH), were still able to invade 3 D cells to similar levels as wildtype (Figure 3D). Utilization of the Fim mutants is also functioning as a control for bacteria that cannot interact with M cells, but can still invade our 3 D aggregates, demonstrating thatSalmonellaentry into 3 D cells is not solely dependent upon interactions with M cell/M like cells.\n\nThe large intestine, from which HT 29 cells are derived, is composed of multiple epithelial cell types, and we used confocal microscopy to assess if any of these cell types are present in our 3 D aggregates and ifSalmonellais targeting these cell types during infection[58]. We identified two other cell types in addition to M cells/M like cells using immunofluorescence labeling, enterocytes and Paneth cells (Figures 4A and C). Since enterocytes make up the majority of cells within the intestine and also have known absorptive properties, we predicted that a significant proportion ofSalmonellanot localized to M cells/M like cells could be targeting enterocytes[59]. After dual staining of 3 D HT 29 cells with the M cell marker (sialyl Lewis A) and enterocyte marker (syndecan 1) antibodies, we observed very little overlap of cells expressing both markers, demonstrating two different cellular populations within the aggregates (Figure S6)[54],[55],[60],[61]. Three dimensional cells were infected with either wildtype or SPI 1Salmonellamutant, fixed 5 mpi, stained with both enterocyte andSalmonellaspecific antibodies, and the number of bacteria out of 50 bacteria localized to the enterocyte marker was quantitated by confocal immunofluorescence (Figure 4B). A majority of bacteria localized to cells expressing the enterocyte marker, with no significant difference in localization between wildtype and the SPI 1 mutant, suggesting that the SPI 1 encoded T3SS does not play a role in host cell type targeting in the intestinal epithelium during infection.\n\nA) Uninfected 3 D HT 29 cells fixed and stained with anti syndecan 1 antibody (enterocyte marker) and DAPI to visualize nuclei. B) Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy images (100x objective) of 3 D HT 29 aggregates infected with either wildtype or SPI 1Salmonellamutant, fixed 5 mpi, and stained with enterocyte marker (red), anti Salmonellaantibody (green), and DAPI (blue). Percentages represent bacteria localized to enterocyte marker (N=3). C) Uninfected 3 D HT 29 cells fixed and stained with anti PLA2 antibody (Paneth cell marker) and DAPI. D) Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy images (100x objective) of 3 D HT 29 aggregates infected with either wildtype or SPI 1Salmonellamutant, fixed 5 mpi, and stained with Paneth cell marker antibody (red), anti Salmonellaantibody (green), and DAPI (blue). Percentages represent number of bacteria localized to Paneth cell marker (N=3). E) Quantitation of confocal images as observed inFigs. 3A, 4B and 4D, and also including 3 D HT 29 aggregates infected for 5 10 min with SPI 2, SPI 1/2, and SPI 1/2:flhDC Salmonellamutants and profiled with host cellular markers. Percentages represent the number of bacteria localized to markers/50 bacteria from three different experiments and independent batches of 3 D HT 29 cells. No significant difference was observed when comparing each bacterial strain to wildtype for each host cell marker (N=3).\n\nThe third cell type we identified in the 3 D HT 29 aggregates were Paneth cells, a cell type known to secrete antimicrobials, including defensins, with no detectable absorptive properties[62],[63],[64],[65](Figure 4C). After 3 D HT 29 infection with the wildtype or SPI 1 mutant, and quantitation by confocal microscopy of the number of bacteria out of 50 bacteria that localized to cells expressing the Paneth cell marker (Phospholipase A2)[66], we observed <10% of bacteria localized to cells expressing this marker (Figure 4D). Consistent with previous reports of diseased colon tissue samples, we noted an increase in Paneth cell marker expression upon infection (Figure 4C and D)[64],[65]. Goblet cells are a known fourth cell type within the intestine. While our 3 D HT 29 cells did exhibit mucus production (a hallmark of goblet cells), we were unable to definitively identify goblet cells in the 3 D HT 29 cells by immunofluorescence microscopy using a goblet cell marker antibody[32],[67]. TheSalmonellaSPI 2, SPI 1/2, and SPI 1/2:flhDCmutants were also profiled for host cell type localization within the 3 D HT 29 aggregates, and similar localization profiles with no significant difference in marker localization of these mutants were observed as compared to wildtypeSalmonella(Figure 4E). Collectively, these data suggest thatSalmonellaT3SSs do not influence the active targeting of the bacteria to a specific cell type in the 3 D intestinal cells during infection.\n\nOur data established thatSalmonellaT3SSs are not required for invasion into 3 D HT 29 cells; however we were interested in observing the intracellular growth profiles of the T3SS mutants after entry into 3 D cells and their profiles compared to monolayers (Figure 5). We thus infected monolayers and 3 D HT 29 cells with the various bacterial strains at an m.o.i. of 10 for 1 hour. At the indicated times post infection, host cells were lysed and bacteria were enumerated for colony forming units. WildtypeSalmonellaand the SPI 2 mutant had similar growth profiles between monolayers and 3 D cells with an increase in growth by 24 hpi compared to 3 hpi. The SPI 1, SPI 1/2,flhDC, and SPI 1/2:flhDCmutants had little to no detectable growth by 24 hpi in monolayers; however, these mutants grew to levels similar as the SPI 2 mutant in 3 D cells, although the mutant strains never reached wildtype growth levels. The non invasive Gram negativeE. coliand Gram positiveB. subtiliswere also used as controls to infect 3 D cells; however neither bacterium had detectable intracellular growth by 24 hpi, further suggesting that a bacterial specific active invasion mechanism is necessary for bacterial internalization into 3 D cells. These growth curves also demonstrate the ability of theSalmonellamutants to invade and survive within 3 D cells for 24 hours, as they are not killed by the gentamicin in the extracellular media as observed withE. coliandB. subtilis(Figure 2DandFigure 5B). From these data, we conclude that SPI 1, SPI 2, and the flagellar secretion system are not necessary for invasion into 3 D HT 29 cells, but are required for wildtype levels of invasion and intracellular replication.\n\nIntracellular growth of wildtypeSalmonella,T3SSSalmonellamutants, and non invasiveE. coliandB. subtilisstrains measured at 3 hpi (black bars), 8 hpi (gray bars), and 24 hpi (white bars) in HT 29 monolayers (A) and 3 D aggregates (B). For both cell culture models, HT 29 cells were infected at an m.o.i. of 10 for 1 hour and lysed at each indicated time point and plated to enumerate bacterial CFU. CFU quantitation represents an average of at least three independent experiments from three separate batches of cells. * and ** indicate statistical significance ofp<0.05 and 0.001, respectively, comparing 8 and 24 hpi to 3 hpi for each bacterial strain.",
    "discussion": "In previous work, we established and characterized a 3 D organotypic model of human large intestinal epithelium from the colonic epithelial cell line HT 29 utilizing the cellular suspension RWV bioreactor system[32],[36]. HT 29 cells grown in three dimensions in the RWV displayed numerous characteristics relevant to theirin vivotissue counterparts, demonstrating the potential of utilizing RWV derived 3 D cells as surrogate models to elucidate cellular mechanisms and responses to conditions encountered in the human gastrointestinal tract, such as during an enteric pathogen infection[32],[36]. We previously reported that aninvA Salmonellamutant (which is defective for invasion of monolayers) invaded into 3 D HT 29 cells to similar levels as wildtype, and to our knowledge, this was the first report to suggest that the SPI T3SS may not be the main determinant for invasion ofSalmonellaintoin vitromodels of human intestinal epithelium[32],[43]. While intriguing, our previous findings did not definitively preclude a role for the SPI 1 T3SS in intestinal invasion, nor did we apply the 3 D large intestinal model to investigate the role of the two other T3SSs inSalmonella, the SPI 2 encoded T3SS and theflhDCregulated flagellum secretory system. In this report, we fundamentally expanded our studies to show that the 3 D model of large intestinal epithelium displays multicellular complexity relevant to the normal parental tissuein vivo, including formation of M cells/M like cells, enterocytes and Paneth cells. We subsequently applied these highly differentiated 3 D intestinal cultures as human surrogate infection models to elucidate the role of all characterizedSalmonellaT3SSs in the early stages of human enteric salmonellosis. Specifically, we infected 3 D HT 29 and monolayer cells with variousSalmonellamutants carrying single (SPI 1 or SPI 2), double (SPI 1/2) and a complete T3SS knockout (SPI 1/SPI 2:flhDC), respectively. We observed substantial differences in the roles of the T3SSs during invasion into and growth within the 3 D HT 29 cells as compared to monolayers, but notably, we identified similar key phenotypic responses between the 3 D cells followingSalmonellachallenge with those reported during thein vivoinfection process.\n\nThe initial key difference that we observed in response to infection between 3 D large intestinal cells and established data utilizing monolayers, was the significant increase in invasion of a SPI 1 encoded T3SS mutant into the 3 D cells (Figure 2A and B), a mutant previously characterized to be invasion defective in monolayers[43],[44]. The SPI 1 mutant lacking the entire SPI 1 coding region displayed lower levels of invasion compared to theinvAT3SS mutant in both culture systems, and this could be a result of the absence of the entire SPI 1 PAI (Pathogenicity Island) in the SPI 1 mutant, which could potentially contain effectors aiding in bacterial invasion. Surprisingly, a SPI 1/2 double mutant and a SPI 1/2:flhDCtriple mutant, a strain lacking all characterized T3SS secretion systems, also invaded into the 3 D intestinal cells at similar levels (Figure 2E). While the TTSS mutants were able to invade 3 D cells, the invasion levels were significantly lower compared to wildtype. These data suggest that TTSSs contribute to a more productive bacterial invasion of 3 D cells, but an unidentified bacterial factor(s) is contributing to majority ofSalmonellainvasion into 3 D cells. We are currently attempting to identify the bacterial and/or host factors that are the major regulators of invasion forSalmonellainto human 3 D intestinal cells. However, once intracellular, each single, double and triple T3SS mutant was unable to grow to levels similar to that of wildtype (Figure 5B), suggesting that each T3SS system is necessary for successful replication ofSalmonellainside 3 D intestinal cells. Interestingly, even though the SPI 1 mutant still contains the SPI 2 system and its encoded effectors predicted to be responsible for intracellular survival, the SPI 1 mutant did not replicate as well as wildtype once inside the host cells. These data are consistent with work utilizing monolayers showing that aSalmonella invAmutant was unable to grow after induced invasion of epithelial cells[68]. We are currently characterizing the role of SPI 2 and its secreted effectors inSalmonellaintracellular trafficking and replication within our 3 D intestinal models.\n\nUntil recently, the paradigm forSalmonellaentry into human intestinal epithelial cells was based upon results from monolayer cell cultures and non human animal models[6],[10],[17],[18],[19],[20],[21],[22],[26],[27]; however our work with highly differentiated 3 D human intestinal epithelial cells cultivated in the RWV bioreactor demonstrated infection phenotypes more closely related to those observedin vivo[28],[31],[32],[36],[49]. The RWV bioreactor system is only one example of how advancements in technology facilitate the improvement of tissue engineered model systems to more accurately mimicin vivoconditions in the native host, thus allowing researchers to study host pathogen interactions in an accessible, reproducible, and tractablein vitrosystem[22],[23],[24],[26],[36],[39]. However, as previously discussed, choice of host species has been shown to greatly influence the outcome of aSalmonellainfection, and several studies utilizing a variety of advanced model systems have shown that T3SSs are necessary forSalmonellainvasion and infection of these models[17],[18],[19],[21],[22],[23],[26],[39]. Recently however, non human models studyingSalmonellapathogenesis are in agreement with our findings reported in this study, that SPI 1 is not critical for the invasion of host cells. One such example was conducted by Coombeset al., 2005, wherein this group utilized a novel explant/re implantation calf ileal loop model to investigate the role of SPI 1 and SPI 2 during the later stages of aSalmonellainfection[69]. Interestingly, the SPI 1Salmonellamutant not only infected the tissues of the small intestine, but by 5 days post infection, severe inflammation, submucosal edema, necrosis, vascular thrombosis, and villus atrophy had also occurred. In a separate study, Desinet al., 2009, observed colonization of aSalmonella entericasubsup.Entericaserovar Enteritidis strain lacking SPI 1 in the cecum of chickens[70]. In a similar example, the fowl adaptedSalmonellastrain,Salmonella entericaserovar Gallinarum, was also able to invade animal cells independently of SPI 1[71]. Moreover, aSalmonellaTyphimurium SPI 1 mutant was recovered at comparable levels to the wildtype strain from the intestine, intestinal contents, Peyer's patches, lymph nodes, and spleen of mice following oral infection[49]. Recently, using anin vitropolarized co cultured human intestinal cell culture model, wildtypeSalmonellaTyphimurium and mutants lacking multiple SPI 1 effectors showed similar translocation of host cells[39]. Results from these studies and the naturally occurringSalmonellainfection, demonstrate the lack of dependence ofSalmonellaon SPI 1 to cause disease in human and animal hosts. These studies not only corroborate our findings regarding the lack ofSalmonelladependence on SPI 1 to invade our 3 D organotypic intestinal epithelial models, but also demonstrate the urgent need for development of morein vivo like cell culture systems and their use in combination with animal models to better understand the underlying mechanisms of disease.\n\nIn an attempt to identify the bacterial mechanism(s) playing a role in invasion of our 3 D intestinal epithelial cells in the absence of SPI 1, we constructed aSalmonellamutant absent for all characterized T3SSs that could be utilized to secrete effectors aiding in invasion (SPI 1 T3SS, SPI 2 T3SS, and the flagellar pore). Interestingly, invasion of the SPI 1/2/flagellar secretory mutant (defective for all T3SSs) still occurred in our 3 D intestinal model (Figure 2), alluding to the potential of an uncharacterized or undiscovered mechanism(s) utilized bySalmonellafor invasion into 3 D intestinal cells and possibly during infection as well. Currently, 12 differentSalmonellapathogenicity islands (PAIs) have been identified based on genetic classifications and characteristics of PAIs, however many of the identified PAI encoded genes only have predicted putative functions with no clear role inSalmonellapathogenesis[72]. Interestingly, several PAIs are predicted to encode functions that have the capacity to assist inSalmonellainvasion of 3 D intestinal cells, with numerous genes encoding for pili and fimbrae[73],[74]. Similar with published reports, we have already demonstrated that type 1 pili encoded by thefimoperon is not necessary for invasion into 3 D intestinal cells (Figure 3C and D), however in work done by others, SPI 7 was shown to contain a putative type IVB pilus that could be aiding in bacterial invasion in this study[57],[72]. Moreover, SPI 6 and SPI 10 encode for fimbrae, and both were shown to be critical in bacterial invasion and intracellular survival[72],[75],[76],[77],[78]. However, the genomes ofSalmonellaserovars contain large numbers of fimbrial operons located outside of PAIs, any of which could potentially be responsible for the SPI 1 independent invasion of 3 D intestinal cells, in turn making the identification of the exact invasion mechanism(s) quite challenging[79],[80]. Moreover, in recent work, SPI 4 was demonstrated to encode a functional T1SS used to secrete effectors necessary for bacterial adhesion to epithelial cells[81]. To further complicate identification of the mechanism(s) responsible forSalmonellainvasion into our 3 D intestinal cells, the epithelial cells themselves will also likely express and display surface structures necessary for bacterial invasion. Accordingly, both host and bacterial factor(s) have to be investigated, and we are currently examining several of these mechanisms in the attempt to identify the means ofSalmonellainvasion into our 3 D intestinal epithelial cells.\n\nIn this study, we utilized a rotating cell culture system that allows mammalian cells to be grown under physiological levels of fluid shear stress that help facilitate the formation of 3 D cellular aggregates possessing structural and functional characteristics similar to thein vivoparental tissues[36]. As previously observedin vivowhereSalmonellawas able to infect a host in the absence of a functional SPI 1 T3SS, we have shown analogous results in our 3 D organotypic models of human intestinal epithelium. We also show thatSalmonellainvasion into our 3 D intestinal models occurred in the absence of all characterizedS. typhimuriumtype three secretory systems (SPI 1 T3SS, SPI 2 T3SS, and flagellar pore) that could be transporting bacterial effectors assisting in invasion into host epithelial cells. Moreover, our results indicate that invasion of 3 D intestinal cells by wildtype and SPI mutants was a bacterial active process, whereas non invasive bacterial strains did not invade the 3 D cells, even those cells with known absorptive properties, including M cells/M like cells and enterocytes. Studies are on going in our lab to define the molecular mechanism(s) ofSalmonellaSPI 1 independent epithelial cell invasion into our 3 D intestinal models.\n\nThe work presented here reveals many key similarities between the response of in vitro 3 D models of human intestinal epithelium and their parental tissuesin vivoduring aSalmonellainfection, highlighting the potential of these organotypic models to 1) serve as powerful tools to facilitate the dissection of the molecular mechanisms of human enteric salmonellosis, 2) provide anin vivolike system to study other gastrointestinal pathogens, and 3) serve as models for the development of novel strategies to combat infectious disease.",
