    "abstract": "Fungal spores contain secondary metabolites that can protect them from a multitude of abiotic and biotic stresses. Conidia (asexual spores) of the human pathogenAspergillus fumigatussynthesize several metabolites, including melanin, which has been reported to be important for virulence in this species and to be protective against UV radiation in other fungi. Here, we investigate the role of melanin in diverse isolates ofA. fumigatusand find variability in its ability to protect spores from UV C radiation or impact virulence in a zebrafish model of invasive aspergillosis in two clinical strains and one ISS strain. Further, we assess the role of other spore metabolites in a clinical strain ofA. fumigatusand identify fumiquinazoline as an additional UV C protective molecule but not a virulence determinant. The results show differential roles of secondary metabolites in spore protection dependent on the environmental stress and strain ofA. fumigatus. As protection from elevated levels of radiation is of paramount importance for future human outer space explorations, the discovery of small molecules with radiation protective potential may result in developing novel safety measures for astronauts.\n\nKEYWORDS:Aspergillus fumigatus, space station, UV C, melanin, secondary metabolite, spore, virulence determinants",
    "methods": "The strains used in this study are listed inTableS1. The generated mutants were stored in 30% (vol/vol) glycerol in 0.01% (vol/vol) Tween 80 at  80 degreesC. Strains were activated and grown at 37 degreesC on glucose minimal medium (GMM; 6 g/liter NaNO3, 0.52 g/liter KCl, 0.52 g/liter MgSO47H2O, 1.52 g/liter KH2PO4, 10 g/literd glucose, 15 g/liter agar supplemented with 1ml/liter trace elements) for 3days to collect and enumerate conidia in 0.01% (vol/vol) Tween 80. For UV C exposure and secondary metabolite (SM) analysis, approximately 102conidia per plate (diameter, 10cm) were suspended in 5ml of GMM agar containing half of the agar concentration (top agar) and grown at 37 degreesC for 7days. For assessment of virulence in larval zebrafish, plates were inoculated with 1x106conidia of the appropriate fungal strain and incubated at 37 degreesC for 3days. Conidia were harvested in 0.01% (vol/vol) Tween 80 using a cell spreader and filtered through Miracloth. Conidial stocks for microinjection were resuspended in Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at a concentration of 1.5x108conidia/ml.\n\nTo create the pksPmutant in IF1SW F4, the CRISPR Cas9 system developed by the Mortensen lab was used (65). In brief, the IF1SW F4 was tested for antibiotic sensitivity against hygromycin (hyg) and phleomycin (ble) to determine the selection marker and associated plasmid for targetingpksP. The strain showed sensitivity to 80ug/ml hyg; hence, the plasmid pFC332 containing the hyg cassette was used for fungal transformation. Further, the 20 bp sequence 5 ATC GCC AGC AAC GCC ACG CA 3, a protospacer targetingpksP, was selected within thepksPgene and introduced to the pFC332 plasmid using the custom primers Fw1 (5 TAG CTG TTT CCG CTG A 3), Rev1 (5 TGC GTG GCG TTG CTG GCG ATG ACG AGC TTA CTC GTT TCG TCC TCA CGG ACT CAT CAG ATC GCC CGG TGA TGT CTG CTC AAG 3), Fw2 (5 TCG TCA TCG CCA GCA ACG CCA CGC AGT TTT AGA GCT AGA AAT AGC AAG TTA A 3), and Rev2 (5 ATT CTG CTG TCT CGG CTG 3). Upon this step, plasmid was propagated intoEscherichia coliDH5alpha, purified using the QIAprep Spin miniprep kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and used for transformation. Correct transformants were selected based on the loss of the pigment and used for downstream analyses. For gene deletion mutants, construction of the gene deletion cassette, production of protoplasts, and subsequent polyethylene glycol (PEG) transformation were performed as described previously (66). Briefly, primers (TableS3) were designed containing a 20  to 30 bp overlap were used to amplify 1,000 bp homologous regions of the gene of interest using SeqBuilder (DNAStar, Madison, WI).\n\nPrimers used in this study.

Strains were transformed using either Af293.1, providing a background with an intactakuA, or TFYL 80.1 for the akuAbackground. Transformants were screened by selecting transformants that were able to grow in the absence of the appropriate supplements. Loss of the gene of interest and proper integration of the deletion construct were confirmed via PCR and Southern blot analysis (Fig.S3).\n\nTo evaluate the UV C sensitivity of studied mutants, approximately 102conidia/plate were exposed to various UV C doses. Conidia were suspended in top GMM cooled to 55 degreesC, and 5ml of this suspension was added to plates with 20ml of GMM (100% of the agar). Triplicates of each strain were exposed to 10 , 15 , and 20 mJ/cm2doses of UV C using a Hoefer UVC 500 crosslinker (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, UK). Upon exposure, treated and untreated (control plates) were incubated at 37 degreesC. After 7days, CFU were enumerated, and the percent survival was calculated using the following formula: no. of CFU exposed to any given dose (N)/CFU in control plate (N0) x 100. The results from three biological replicates were pooled and used for statistical analysis with GraphPad Prism 8 using Welch's correctedttest.\n\nTo examine the production of SMs of interest, agar plugs in triplicate were collected from unexposed plates. Plugs were extracted with 3ml of methanol (MeOH) and 1:1 MeOH DCM each, followed by 1 h of sonication. Crude extracts were evaporatedin vacuoand extracted with 3ml of ethyl acetate (EtOAc). The EtOAc layer was evaporatedin vacuoto yield a residue suspended in 1ml of 20% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) MeOH, and 10ul was examined by high performance liquid chromatography photodiode array detection mass spectrometry (HPLC DAD MS) analysis. HPLC MS was carried out using a Thermo Finnigan LCQ Advantage ion trap mass spectrometer with a reverse phase (RP) C18column (Alltech Prevail C18, 3mm, 2.1by100mm) at a flow rate 125ul/min. The solvent gradient for LC MS was 95% methyl cyanide (MeCN) H2O (solvent B) in 5% MeCN H2O (solvent A), both containing 0.05% formic acid, as follows: 0% solvent B from 0 to 5min, 0% to 100% solvent B from 5min to 35min, 100% solvent B from 35 to 40min, 100% to 0% solvent B from 40 to 45min, and reequilibration with 0% solvent B from 45 to 50min.\n\nAdult zebrafish were reared as described previously (46). Briefly, adults were maintained on a dedicated aquatic system and subjected to a light/dark cycle of 14 h/10h and fed twice a day. After spawning, embryos were collected in E3 buffer supplemented with methylene blue (MB) to inhibit fungal growth and incubated at 28.5 degreesC. At 24h postfertilization, embryos were manually decoryonated and transferred to E3 buffer lacking MB. Prior to microinjection, larvae were anesthetized in E3 buffer containing 0.2mg/ml Tricaine (ethyl 3 aminobenzoate; Sigma Aldrich). Larval zebrafish procedures and adult handling were performed in compliance with NIH guidelines and approved by the University of Wisconsin Madison Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\nVirulence assays were performed using the larval zebrafish model of invasive aspergillosis, as described previously (46), with slight modifications. Neutrophil defective larvae were obtained genetically through the use of transgenicmpx:mCherry 2A rac2D57Nlarvae (47). Prior to infection, larvae were screened and selected for mCherry expression in neutrophils to identify individuals harboring the dominant negative allele. Briefly, hindbrain ventricle infections were performed at 48h postfertilization using conidial stocks that were mixed 2:1 with 1% phenol red (used to visualize injection success) to a final concentration of 1x108conidia/ml stock. Larvae were anesthetized in E3 lacking MB and supplemented with 0.2mg/ml Tricaine prior to microinjection of 3 nl conidia stock or PBS vehicle control into the hindbrain ventricle through the otic vesicle. Following microinjection, larvae were rinsed several times to remove the anesthetic and transferred to individual wells of a 96 well plate in 200 ul E3 lacking MB. The survival of individual larvae was scored daily using a loss of heartbeat as a readout of mortality. Survival analysis for larval zebrafish infection experiments was performed as previously described (46) by pooling experimental replicates and generatingPvalues by the Cox proportional hazards regression analysis.",
    "results": "Three control strains, namely, Af293, an akuAmutant, and a akuA  mlucmutant, were examined to demonstrate the impact of the disruption ofakuAin UV C response. This deletion allows for homologous recombination and thus creates a fungus that is easy to genetically manipulate and allows for faster creation of specific mutant strains (33). However, AkuA is involved in DNA repair (34) and would be expected to show enhanced sensitivity to UV treatment. The disruption ofakuAsignificantly decreased the survival rate, at 90%, in contrast to 60% decrease in survival of wild type (WT) Af293 upon UV C exposure (Fig.1A); however, there were no differences in UV C sensitivity between the akuAmutant and the akuA mlucstrain (35), which was also used for gene deletion studies (seeTableS1in the supplemental material). Despite an increase in sensitivity to UV C, the akuAmutant strains still demonstrated a dose response to increasing UV C and thus were deemed suitable for this study. There were no differences in SM profiles between the WT Af293, akuAmutant, and akuA  mlucmutant strains (Fig.1B).\n\nUV C sensitivity and secondary metabolite profiles of Af293, akuAmutant, and akuA  mlucmutant strains.

DHN melanin was tested as a protective molecule from UV C radiation by deletingpksPencoding the polyketide synthase required for DHN melanin biosynthesis (37) in both WT Af293 and in the Af293 akuAbackground. As shown inFig.2A, the loss ofpksPresulted in strains more sensitive to UV C regardless of the presence or absence ofakuA. This increase in sensitivity was seen at all UV C doses in a comparison of the WT to the pksPmutant (50% versus 25% survival rate at 10 mJ/cm2, 23% versus 3.5% at 15 mJ/cm2, and 7% versus 0.9% at 20 mJ/cm2, respectively) and in a comparison of the akuAmutant to the akuApksPdouble mutant (7% versus 3% at 10 mJ/cm2, 2% versus 0.5% at 15 mJ/cm2, and 1% versus 0.1% at 20 mJ/cm2, respectively) (TableS2A). Chemical profiling of these strains did not show any differences in the production of other SMs due to the loss ofpksP(Fig.2B), but, as expected, both pksPand akuApksPconidia showed a lack of DHN melanin pigmentation (Fig.S1).\n\nUV C sensitivity and secondary metabolite profiles of Af293 and Af293 DHN melanin mutants in the intact and disruptedakuAbackgrounds.

Upon exposure to UV C, it was observed that PksP loss did not significantly diminish the survival of the ISS isolate compared to respective control strain producing DHN melanin (Fig.3AandTableS2C). SMs were quantified in these strains and showed no differences in the IF1SW F4 WT or pksPstrains (Fig.3B). Simultaneously, the impact of DHN melanin on UV C sensitivity was tested in CEA17 (CEA17 is a CEA10 derivative deleted for AkuB, which forms the functional heterodimer with AkuA [38,39]). Unlike the IF1SW F4 pksPmutant but similar to the Af293 pksPmutants, the CEA17 pksPstrain showed a significantly decreased survival rate compared to that of the CEA17 control (Fig.3CandTableS2B), with values similar to those observed in Af293 with the disrupted AkuA background (5% versus 2% survival rate at 10 mJ/cm2and 0.6% versus 0.4% at 15 mJ/cm2, respectively). Further, the CEA17 pksPstrain showed alterations in its SM profile, including decreased yields of pyripyropene A and fumagillin compared to the control strain (Fig.3D, peaks 3 and 4, respectively).\n\nUV C sensitivity and secondary metabolite profiles of ISS isolated IF1SW F4, CEA17, and their DHN melanin mutants.

Due to their synthesis in the spore as well as aromatic structure and incorporation of tryptophan in two of these metabolites (fumigaclavine and fumiquinazoline), they were tested to determine if they might also provide protection from UV C in Af293. Mutants were created for all three metabolites in both WTakuAand akuAmutant backgrounds (Fig.S3). SM analysis of these deletion mutants confirmed that they did not synthesize the targeted metabolite. Specifically, fumigaclavine C (366.5 g/mol), monomethylsulochrin (346.3 g/mol), and fumiquinazolines C and D (443.5 g/mol) were not detected in extracted ion chromatograms (EICs) of the respective deletion mutants (Fig.S4). Considering that trypacidin is not detectable until 9 to 10days of growth, monomethylsulochrin (the final intermediate of the trypacidin biosynthetic pathway) was used to confirm the disruption of the trypacidin biosynthetic pathway. In the WT background, the fumiquinazoline mutant (fmqA) was more sensitive to UV C (35%) (Fig.4CandTableS2D), but the loss of either fumigaclavine (dmaWmutant) or trypacidin (tpcCmutant) pathway metabolites had no impact on spore survival (Fig.4AandBandTableS2D). However, examination of these same SM mutations in the akuAbackground gave different results, where strains deficient in fumigaclavine A (akuAdmaWmutant) and trypacidin (akuAtpcCmutant) were slightly more resistant to UV C than was the akuAcontrol after exposure to 10 mJ/cm2(P= 0.0043 and 0.0006, respectively) (Fig.4DandEandTableS2E) and the fumiquinazoline null strain (akuAfmqAmutant) showed no significant change in UV C resistance compared to akuA(Fig.4Fand TableS2D compared to 2E). These findings suggested thatakuAloss alters the UV C protective properties of some conidial pigments and may allow for the identification of mutants that can enhance UV C resistance.\n\nUV C sensitivity and secondary metabolite profiles of conidium associated SM mutants of Af293 in backgrounds with disrupted and intactakuA.

Whereas both the CEA17 and IF1SW F4 pksPmutant strains were significantly decreased in virulence, the Af293 pksPmutant was not (Fig.5).\n\nVirulence of DHN melanin mutants of threeAspergillus fumigatusstrains in a zebrafish model of invasive aspergillosis.

Together, our results suggest that the involvement of spore SMs in virulence is strain dependent and that their protective roles in fungal biology vary with the type of environmental stress.\n\nVirulence of three conidial SM mutants ofAspergillus fumigatusin a zebrafish model of invasive aspergillosis.

    "discussion": "While the radiation protective properties of melanin in fungi have been previously documented (21,22,48,49), little is known about the UV C protective features of other SMs or of DHN melanin inA. fumigatus. SinceA. fumigatusstrains have been isolated from space station environments characterized by high UV C levels (12) and increased virulence (1), it was prudent to investigate the UV C properties of conidial SMs and their plausible correlation with pathogenicity. Here, we found that DHN melanin protects some but not allA. fumigatusisolates from UV C radiation and that fumiquinazolines are UV C protectants in WT Af293.\n\nThis study demonstrated thatakuA, which plays fundamental role in the nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway, a preferred DNA repair pathway of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) in fungi (50 52), is critical in protection from UV C. The disruption ofakuAgene, which increases the transformation success rate via homologous recombination (HR), led to a ca. 90% decrease in survival upon exposure to the lowest UV C dose, 10 mJ/cm2, while the Af293 WT showed a decrease of 60% for the same dose (Fig.1A). Such discrepancy in the survival rates between the akuAmutant and the WT was of no surprise, as previous reports showed that UV C exposure significantly induces DSB incidence in exposed organisms and cells (53,54). Further, no significant differences were observed in the SM profiles of the tested control strains (Fig.1B), suggesting thatakuAgene disruption was the main cause of the observed drop in strain survival upon UV C exposure. However, we found that using anakuAnull background could mask the ability to identify UV C protective SMs, possibly dependent on the relative contributions of each metabolite. For instance, the deletion ofpksPin Af293 resulted in increased sensitivity to UV C regardless of theakuAbackground (Fig.2), but the protective property of fumiquinazoline was masked in the akuAbackground (Fig.4CversusF).\n\nUnexpectedly, during the study, it was noticed that the UV C protective property of DHN melanin was strain dependent. Previous studies with other fungi have demonstrated the importance of DHN melanin in UV protection (21,22,48), but an examination of melanin in different isolates within a species has not been reported, to our knowledge. Af293, CEA10, and CEA17 are commonly studied clinical strains ofA. fumigatus(33,45,55) and in IF1SW F4, a strain previously reported as being isolated from the ISS (1). Further, DHN melanin deficient strain CEA17, but not strain IF1SW F4, was more sensitive to UV C (Fig.3). These data suggest that there might be other metabolites which are important for tolerating the UV C stress in IF1SW F4. We also note that differentA. fumigatusstrains synthesize different SMs and different amounts of each SM which could contribute to differences in UV C sensitivity (Fig.3) (1,42). Such UV C protective compounds are of paramount importance during future outer space explorations, as they may be implemented to protect other organisms, including humans and plants (56).\n\nConsidering the differential role of DHN melanin in UV protection coupled with the already known differences in Af293, CEA10, and CEA17 virulence (43 46,57,58), we speculated that PksP might also play a differential role in virulence dependent onA. fumigatusstrains. Using the neutrophil deficient zebrafish model of invasive aspergillosis (46), we found this to be true but not in the manner we had anticipated. We had hypothesized that there might be a correlation between the importance of DHN melanin in UV C protection (where PksP protected Af293 and CEA17;Fig.2and3) and virulence, but instead, we found that the CEA17 and IF1SW F4 pksPmutants (but not the Af293 mutant) showed a loss in virulence as measured by zebrafish mortality (Fig.5). CEA17 showed the most significant attenuation of virulence of the two isolates. Different strains ofA. fumigatus, including CEA10 (and derivatives such as CEA17) and Af293, have previously been shown to vary in virulence (in human cells [55],Drosophila melanogaster[43], murine [44,59] and zebrafish [1,40] models). DHN melanin is an important cell wall component that impacts cell wall morphology and assembly (60) and has been shown to be involved in the protection of conidia from the host immune cells inA. fumigatusATCC 46645 (61). The results from both the UV C sensitivity tests together with the virulence assessment suggest that the role of DHN melanin in conidial protection varies with the type of environmental stress.\n\nThis work also presented the findings that other conidial SMs, in this case, fumiquinazoline, can protect from UV C radiation. Fumiquinazoline C is composed of three residues, including the aromatic amino acid tryptophan and its precursor anthranilic acid (62). We hypothesize that this metabolite may contribute to UV production, possibly through tryptophan  and anthranilic acid absorbing properties, and that its protective properties were masked in the highly UV sensitive akuAbackground (Fig.4). We found that the loss of fumigaclavine or trypacidin intermediates had no impact on UV C protection in an AkuA WT background, and these strains were actually more resistant to UV C in theakuAbackground than control strains (Fig.4). The increased resistance might possibly be explained by findings where the loss of one SM often results in increased synthesis of another SM (63), possibly one with some UV C protection in this case. We had thought that trypacidin loss would result in increased sensitivity to UV C, as several of its precursors (e.g., emodin and questin) are pigmented anthraquinones that have been shown to protectXanthoria elegansandCetraria islandicaagainst UV (42,64). Possibly, there are not enough anthraquinones synthesized in Af293 to have a measurable effect on UV sensitivity. We further assessed the impact of the loss of these SMs on virulence in the zebrafish model and found no correlation to sensitivity to UV C (Fig.4and6). These results parallel our observations on DHN melanin loss, namely, that each SM may have differential role dependent on environmental stress.\n\nThis study is the first comprehensive report to show the impact of conidium associated SMs ofA. fumigatuson UV C protection and virulence. The results demonstrated strain dependent involvement of DHN melanin in both UV C protection and virulence, highlighting that the role of fungal SMs cannot be generalized across a species. We also identify fumiquinazoline as playing a role in UV C protection in strain Af293. In depth analyses with regard toA. fumigatusvirulence factors and UV C resistance are important especially in isolated environments such as the space station. IF1SW F4, isolated from the ISS and shown to be more virulent than both Af293 and CEA10 (1), but possibly, the molecules and properties leading to increased virulence are different from those of Af293 or CEA10. Such understanding may help develop and promote safety precautions for astronauts during long term space explorations.",
