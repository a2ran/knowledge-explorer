    "abstract": "Abundant populations of bacteria have been observed on Mir and the International Space Station. While some experiments have shown that bacteria cultured during spaceflight exhibit a range of potentially troublesome characteristics, including increases in growth, antibiotic resistance and virulence, other studies have shown minimal differences when cells were cultured during spaceflight or on Earth. Although the final cell density of bacteria grown during spaceflight has been reported for several species, we are not yet able to predict how different microorganisms will respond to the microgravity environment. In order to build our understanding of how spaceflight affects bacterial final cell densities, additional studies are needed to determine whether the observed differences are due to varied methods, experimental conditions, or organism specific responses.\n\nHere, we have explored how phosphate concentration, carbon source, oxygen availability, and motility affect the growth ofPseudomonas aeruginosain modified artificial urine media during spaceflight. We observed thatP. aeruginosagrown during spaceflight exhibited increased final cell density relative to normal gravity controls when low concentrations of phosphate in the media were combined with decreased oxygen availability. In contrast, when the availability of either phosphate or oxygen was increased, no difference in final cell density was observed between spaceflight and normal gravity. Because motility has been suggested to affect how microbes respond to microgravity, we compared the growth of wild typeP. aeruginosato amotABCD mutant deficient in swimming motility. However, the final cell densities observed with the motility mutant were consistent with those observed with wild type for all conditions tested.\n\nThese results indicate that differences in bacterial final cell densities observed between spaceflight and normal gravity are due to an interplay between microgravity conditions and the availability of substrates essential for growth. Further, our results suggest that microbes grown under nutrient limiting conditions are likely to reach higher cell densities under microgravity conditions than they would on Earth. Considering that the majority of bacteria inhabiting spacecrafts and space stations are likely to live under nutrient limitations, our findings highlight the need to explore the impact microgravity and other aspects of the spaceflight environment have on microbial growth and physiology.\n\nKeywords:Spaceflight, Microgravity,Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Flow cytometry, Motility",
    "methods": "Pseudomonas aeruginosaPA14 [23] and its isogenic motility mutant,motABCD[40], were used for the current experiment. All strains were grown overnight at 37 degreesC with shaking at 225rpm in nutrient broth (NB) (Difco BD). To prepare inocula, cultures were washed and resuspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to a final concentration of ~6 x 106CFU/mL. The modified artificial urine medium (mAUM) used in the present study is based on the medium previously described by Brookset al.,[31]. To ensure reproducibility in media composition, RPMI 1640 amino acid solution (50x; Sigma, cat #: R7131) and L glutamine solution (200mM; Sigma, cat #: G7513) were substituted for peptone and yeast extract. The concentration of calcium chloride dihydrate was lowered from 2.5mM to 0.25mM to minimize precipitation during storage at 8 degreesC. Sodium nitrate, 6mM, was added to serve as a terminal electron acceptor and enable some growth under oxygen limiting conditions. Higher concentrations of sodium nitrate were avoided to minimize any effects on aerobic growth and limit the accumulation of nitrite, which can inhibit cell growth. To test the effects of carbon source, 2mM citric acid was substituted by 2mM glucose (mAUMg). To assess the role of phosphate availability, we used either 5mM or 50mM phosphate, where mAUM and mAUMg include 5mM phosphate and mAUM high Pi and mAUMg high Pi contain 50mM phosphate. The pH of all media was adjusted to 7.0.\n\nSpaceflight and ground control cultures ofP. aeruginosawere prepared and grown in a fluid processing apparatus (FPA) as described previously [24]. To load the FPA, a 13 mm diameter mixed cellulose ester membrane disc (Millipore) was first attached to a solid or a gas exchange (GE) insert with autoclavable double sided tape (3M). Next, 2.5mL of media and 0.5mL of inoculum were sequentially loaded into two compartments separated by a rubber stopper. Due to constraints imposed by the dimensions of the bevel, approximately 0.6mL of air remained in the compartment containing the media after loading. A third compartment, for FCM samples only, was filled with 2.4mL of 9%w/v paraformaldehyde in PBS. Three biological replicates were prepared for each experimental condition. Eight FPAs were loaded into a single group activation pack (GAP), which enables simultaneous plunging of the rubber stoppers in each FPA, and were incubated in a Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus (CGBA) as described previously [30]. Cultures were grown following the experiment timeline shown in Figure1. Before shuttle launch, all FPAs were loaded and stored at ambient temperature for at least 48h to check for contamination. Samples were subsequently stored at 8 degreesC (L 1) until activation. Five days before shuttle landing, the media and inoculum were combined and incubated at 37 degreesC for 72h (activation). Two days before shuttle landing, the temperature was decreased to 8 degreesC and the FCM samples were fixed with paraformaldehyde (termination). Samples were obtained approximately 6h after shuttle landing and processed immediately. Ground controls were conducted at Kennedy Space Center in parallel with spaceflight samples. The attached membranes were separated from the liquid phase, planktonic fractions. Characterization and analysis of biofilm growth on the membranes have been reported separately [24].\n\nOne mL of the planktonic fraction was sonicated in an ultrasonic bath (Branson 2510) for 8min to disperse any clumps of cells. The planktonic fraction was serially diluted with PBS. Samples were spot plated on NB agar and incubated at 37 degreesC for 18h prior to counting.\n\nBacterial cells fixed with paraformaldehyde were washed with PBS and stained with 4,6 diamidino 2 phenylindole (DAPI; Life Technologies) for 2h at room temperature according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stained samples were diluted to approximately 5 x 105  9 x 106CFU/mL with PBS. Cell numbers were measured using a FACSAria flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) equipped with a 407nm laser. To calculate the concentration of cells from FCM recorded events, liquid counting beads (BD Biosciences) were used following the manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, 50uL of the liquid counting beads was added to 1mL of each diluted sample. The beads were detected by FCM in a separate region that does not overlap with the cells. The number of events in the cell region was recorded until one thousand events in the bead region were detected. The concentration of cells in each sample was calculated using the following equation.\n\nThe experiments were performed using FPAs following the same timeline and temperature profile as described in Figure1. FPAs were incubated at 37 degreesC for 72h. Samples were either processed immediately or stored at 8 degreesC for 48h. To process samples, 1mL of culture was enumerated by plate counting and a second 1mL fraction was fixed with paraformaldehyde and enumerated by FCM.\n\nFor differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy,P. aeruginosastains fixed with paraformaldehyde after experimental termination. The fixedP. aeruginosastains were observed using Olympus IX 81 inverted microscope equipped with DIC optics, 60x/1.35 oil Zeiss.\n\nAll data were represented as mean+/ standard deviation (S.D.) of three biological replicates. Statistical comparison of the number of cells between normal gravity and spaceflight for each different condition was conducted using a one tailed Student'st test. When assessing combinations of two factors (post growth storage and the microgravity environment, or phosphate concentration in media and microgravity) or three factors (motility, phosphate concentration in media, and microgravity), the effects of each factor and their interaction were assessed by two or three way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey tests using PASW Statistics18 (SPSS Inc.). Statistical significance was defined asp<0.05.",
    "results": "To examine how spaceflight affects final cell density,P. aeruginosaPA14 was grown aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis during STS 135 in specialized hardware, known as a fluid processing apparatus (FPA). FPAs have been used extensively to culture microbes during spaceflight [8,13,15,17,24,30]. As shown (Additional file1: Figure S1), FPAs are glass barrels with a bevel on the side. Rubber stoppers are added to form compartments and the bevel enables mixing of the fluids from the different compartments via a plunging action. The first compartment was loaded with modified artificial urine media (mAUM), which was used because it provides a physiologically relevant environment for the study of bacterial growth [31,32]. Understanding how microbes grow in urine aboard a spacecraft or space station may be important for minimizing the potential for both future infections and microbial based failures of the essential water and waste purification systems. Further, because mAUM is a chemically defined medium, it can be easily manipulated to test effects of specific compounds on final cell density. The second compartment was loaded with cells used for inoculation stored in PBS. For fixed samples, a third compartment was filled with a 9%w/v paraformaldehyde solution in PBS.\n\nCultures were grown following the experiment timeline shown in Figure1. Prior to inoculation, the FPAs were stored at 8 degreesC. Following inoculation, cells were cultured at 37 degreesC for 72h. A subset of the cultures were fixed with paraformaldehyde immediately following the 72h culture period and all cultures were subsequently incubated at 8 degreesC for approximately 48h. This 48h period corresponds to the time required for the shuttle to return to Earth, and storage at 8 degreesC during this period minimized additional cell growth of viable cultures and increased the stability of the fixed samples [6,33]. Plate counting was conducted immediately following shuttle landing to determine the number of viable cells in the live samples. The paraformaldehyde fixed samples were stained with DAPI and cell numbers were determined by flow cytometry (FCM).\n\nTimeline of spaceflight experiments.Four days before Shuttle launch (L 4): Media were loaded into FPAs. L 3: Inocula were loaded. L 2: After checking for contamination, 9% (w/v) paraformaldehyde fixative was loaded for FCM samples only. Samples were stored at ambient temperature (AT) from L 4 to L 1. L 1: After a final contamination check, samples were loaded into the CGBA and stored at 8 degreesC. F0: Space Shuttle Atlantis launched. F8: Samples were activated by mixing the media with the inocula. The temperature in the CGBA was increased to 37 degreesC. F11: Samples were terminated by the addition of fixative (FCM samples only) 72h after activation. The temperature in the CGBA was reduced to 8 degreesC. F13: Space Shuttle Atlantis landed. Ground controls were conducted at Kennedy Space Center in parallel with spaceflight samples.\n\nWhile we anticipated data from plate counting and FCM measurements of final cell concentration would yield similar results and reinforce each other, our analysis showed very different results from the two methods under a number of conditions. This discrepancy between the two methods was most pronounced when cells were cultured in mAUM containing 2mM glucose (mAUMg). In mAUMg, FCM data indicated that growth during spaceflight led to increased cell numbers compared to normal gravity, while plate counting data showed no difference in the final cell density between spaceflight and normal gravity (Figure2). However, when the phosphate concentration was increased from 5 to 50mM (mAUMg high Pi), FCM and plate counting data exhibited similar trends (Figure2).\n\nComparison of plate counting and FCM measurements of microbial growth during spaceflight.Wild typeP. aeruginosawas cultured under normal gravity (black bars) and spaceflight (gray bars) conditions in mAUMg containing 5mM or 50mM phosphate.(a)The number of viable cells in unfixed samples was measured by plate counting.(b)The number of cells in fixed samples was measured by flow cytometry (FCM). Statistical differences between normal gravity and spaceflight for each experimental condition were analyzed by one tailed t test: *p<0.05. Error bars indicate SD; N=3.\n\nIn order to resolve the discrepancies between plate counting data and FCM data, we conducted additional ground based experiments where we focused on the effects of storing cells at 8 degreesC following cell growth. Post growth storage was targeted because bacterial storage at low temperatures is known to affect bacterial physiology and viability [34,35]. Although the FCM samples were also stored at 8 degreesC for 48h following cell growth, we note that the paraformaldehyde fixative was added prior to lowering the incubator temperature. To test the role of post growth storage conditions on cell viability, we compared final cell concentrations obtained when cells were plated immediately following growth, or after post growth storage at 48h at 8 degreesC. The same timeline and temperature profile from the spaceflight experiments (Figure1) was followed. As shown in Figure3, results from both plate counting and FCM showed thatP. aeruginosacultured in mAUMg exhibited a 7  to 9 fold decrease in cell numbers following storage at 8 degreesC for 48h (p<0.01, two way ANOVA). Our results indicate that measurements of cell numbers following storage at low temperatures post growth may not accurately represent the amount of growth that occurred in the FPAs, and differences in final cell densities observed between spaceflight samples and ground controls may be confounded by differences in death rates. Because it is not currently feasible to plate count directly following the growth period during spaceflight, FCM measurements of cells fixed immediately following growth provide more reliable information with respect to how much biomass was formed during the growth period. Hereafter, we will describe only the results obtained by FCM of samples fixed immediately after the growth period.\n\nPost growth storage of samples at 8 degreesC for 48h decreases final cell density.Wild typeP. aeruginosawas cultured in mAUMg containing 5mM phosphate at 37 degreesC for 72h. Final cell density was measured immediately following growth ( ) or following post growth storage at 8 degreesC for 48h (+) by plate counting (black bars) or FCM (gray bars). For FCM samples, fixative was added immediately following growth ( ) or after post growth storage at 8 degreesC for 48h (+), and cells were stored at 4 degreesC prior to staining and assessing cell numbers. Diamonds indicate results from two way ANOVA: p<0.01. Error bars, SD; N=3.\n\nP. aeruginosagrown in mAUM during spaceflight exhibited a modest, but significant, 1.5 fold increase in final cell density compared to normal gravity controls (p<0.01,one tailed t test) (Figure4(a)). We also measured final cell densities in mAUM where the concentration of phosphate was increased from 5mM, which is the concentration found in normal human urine [32], to 50mM (mAUM high Pi). In the case of mAUM high Pi, no difference in the final cell density was observed between spaceflight and normal gravity (Figure4(a)).\n\nEffect of spaceflight on final cell density ofP. aeruginosa.Wild typeP. aeruginosaand a motility mutant (motABCD) were cultured under normal gravity (black bars) and spaceflight conditions (gray bars) in FPAs with(a)solid inserts or(b)GE inserts. Cells were cultured in mAUM or mAUMg containing 5mM or 50mM phosphate. Final cell density was measured by FCM. Effect of phosphate on final cell density is significant in FPAs with solid inserts [two way ANOVA, p<0.01]. Effect of gravity on final cell density is significant in 5mM phosphate conditions in FPAs with solid inserts [two way ANOVA,p<0.01]. Statistical differences between spaceflight and normal gravity for each experimental condition was analyzed by one tailed t test: **p<0.01; *p<0.05. Error bars indicate SD; N=3.\n\nIn addition to phosphate, we also examined the effect of carbon source on the response ofP. aeruginosato the spaceflight environment. Changing carbon source is known to affectP. aeruginosametabolism and growth rate [36 38]. To assess the effect of carbon source onP. aeruginosagrowth during spaceflight, we substituted the 2mM citrate found in mAUM with 2mM glucose (mAUMg). As shown in Figure4(a),P. aeruginosagrown in mAUMg during spaceflight showed a 4 fold increase in final cell density compared to normal gravity controls (p<0.05, one tailed t test). Similar to mAUM high Pi, no difference between final cell densities in spaceflight and normal gravity cultures was observed when the phosphate concentration was increased to 50mM (mAUMg high Pi) (Figure4(a)). These results show that while substituting citrate with glucose does not affect the final cell density ofP. aeruginosagrown during spaceflight, altering phosphate concentration does affect final cell density (p<0.01, two way ANOVA), and that there is an interaction between the microgravity environment and phosphate concentration, as factors affecting final cell density, that is statistically significant (p<0.05, two way ANOVA). This finding indicates that increasing phosphate availability can minimize the effect of spaceflight on final cell density ofP. aeruginosa.\n\nWe hypothesized that the effects of spaceflight on final cell density might differ between anaerobic and aerobic conditions. To test this hypothesis, we substituted the solid inserts used in the experiments described above with gas exchange (GE) inserts that allow the movement of gases via a gas permeable membrane. GE inserts have been used previously to increase the oxygen availability and promote aerobic growth in FPAs [13,15,17,39]. Unlike cultures grown with solid inserts (Figure4(a)),P. aeruginosacultured in mAUM with GE inserts showed no difference in final cell density between normal gravity and spaceflight regardless of phosphate concentration (Figure4(b)). Similar results were obtained for samples with GE inserts cultured in mAUMg and either 5 or 50mM phosphate (Figure4(b)). These results indicate that, similar to phosphate, increased oxygen availability can reduce the effects of spaceflight on final cell density.\n\nWe also examined the effects of spaceflight on a motility mutant,motABCD,which lacks the motor proteins required for flagella mediated swimming [40]. In mAUMg,motABCDcultured during spaceflight showed a 3 fold increase in final cell density compared to its normal gravity counterpart (p<0.05, one tailed t test), while in mAUMg high Pi there was no difference in final cell density (Figure4(a)). We also culturedmotABCDwith GE inserts and observed no difference in the final cell density between spaceflight and normal gravity controls, regardless of phosphate availability (Figure4(b)). Overall, we did not observe any significant differences between the final cell density of wild typeP. aeruginosaand the non motile mutant under any of our experimental conditions (p>0.05, three way ANOVA; factors: gravity, phosphate, motility).\n\nIncreases in aggregation and clumping of planktonic cells have been observed forSalmonellagrown during spaceflight [13] andP. aeruginosaPAO1 grown in LSMMG [41]. To assess whether spaceflight conditions induced cellular aggregation in our spaceflight experiments, we observed the fixedP. aeruginosaPA14 planktonic cells by differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy. Interestingly, no clumps or aggregates with more than ~3 cells were observed following growth in mAUM with 5 or 50mM phosphate during spaceflight or on Earth (Figure5), or under any of the other media conditions tested (data not shown).\n\nAbsence of aggregation by planktonic cells grown in FPAs.Representative images obtained by DIC microscopy of paraformaldehyde fixedP. aeruginosacells grown in mAUM containing 5mM phosphate (top) or 50mM phosphate (bottom) during normal gravity and spaceflight. Scale bar is 10um.",
    "discussion": "We have shown that, within the constraints of our spaceflight experiments, FCM of fixed cells provides more reliable measurements of final cell numbers of planktonic cells grown in FPAs during spaceflight and on Earth. Although fixing the cells prevents one from distinguishing between live and dead populations, the effects of post growth storage at 8 degreesC on cell viability indicate that the viability of cells during post growth storage should be assessed on Earth prior to spaceflight studies, and suggest that the use of viable cell measurements should be avoided when possible. Further, a recent study has shown that changes in growth rate that occur whenMicrococcus luteusis cultured in simulated microgravity conditions can be lost within 7h of exposure to normal gravity [42]. Changes in resistance to oxidative stress were similarly lost within 2h afterStaphylococcus aureuscells were removed from LSMMG conditions [43]. Of course, for certain spaceflight studies, such as those assessing changes in virulence or antibiotic resistance, the use of viable cells is essential. Interestingly, the observation thatSalmonellavirulence is increased following growth during spaceflight [13], which has been confirmed by both additional spaceflight and simulated microgravity experiments [15], indicates that at least some of the physiological changes that occur during spaceflight are maintained when the samples are returned to Earth and assayed or used immediately. In theSalmonellavirulence studies, Wilson and co workers stored cells in fresh media at ambient temperature following growth during spaceflight [13,15]. In our experiments we did not use this approach in order to avoid increases in cell number due to the additional media. Together these results highlight the careful, nuanced approach that must be taken in order to conduct spaceflight experiments that provide results that truly reflect how the cells grow and adapt to the spaceflight environment.\n\nWe have systematically studied the effects of spaceflight on the final cell density ofP. aeruginosa,assessing factors known to affect bacterial growth such as phosphate and oxygen availability, carbon source and motility. We have demonstrated that differences between final cell density ofP. aeruginosacultured during spaceflight and on Earth are dependent on nutrient and oxygen availability. Specifically, spaceflight increased the final cell density ofP. aeruginosawhen it was grown with low phosphate and low oxygen availability. When either phosphate or oxygen availability was increased, no difference between normal gravity and spaceflight was observed.\n\nSimilar to previous observations that increasing phosphate concentration or supplementing media with the inorganic ion components of M9 media, which includes phosphate, can minimize the effects of spaceflight or LSMMG on virulence and acid tolerance ofSalmonella[15], we observed that increasing the phosphate concentration from 5 to 50mM in the artificial urine media minimized the differences between spaceflight and normal gravity final cell densities ofP. aeruginosa. Berryet al., have also shown that phosphate uptake bySaccharomyces cerevisiaeincreased when cultured during spaceflight [44].Taken together, these findings may indicate that phosphate plays a key role in microbial responses to spaceflight conditions. However, additional studies are needed to determine whether phosphate is acting simply as a growth limiting nutrient, or if the effect is more specific. While cells grown with 5mM phosphate are not likely to be starved for this essential nutrient, increasing phosphate concentration has been shown to increase the growth rate ofP. aeruginosa[45]. We also observed that using GE inserts minimized differences between final cell concentrations following growth under normal and microgravity. Similarly, Wilsonet al., did not observe any difference in final cell concentration between spaceflight and normal gravity whenSalmonellawas cultured in FPAs with GE inserts, as measured by FCM [13,15,17]. While we observed that the use of GE inserts was advantageous for bacteria grown in normal gravity, no additional increases were observed for spaceflight cultures when the solid inserts were replaced with the GE inserts. This may be attributed to a lower oxygen transfer rate in microgravity, as described previously for LSMMG [16]. Indeed, studies ofP. aeruginosaPAO1 gene expression have indicated that growth in FPAs is likely microaerophilic or anaerobic even with the GE inserts and that differences in oxygen gradients within the FPAs likely exist between normal gravity and spaceflight conditions [17]. We have recently observed that the use of GE inserts also minimized differences inP. aeruginosaPA14 biofilm growth between normal and spaceflight conditions [24]. In that case, we did see increases in biofilm biomass in spaceflight samples with GE inserts. However, the proximity of the biofilm substrate to the GE inserts ensured that any additional oxygen was delivered directly to the growing biofilm cells. Overall, these findings highlight the role that environmental conditions and nutrient availability have on modulating how microbes respond to the spaceflight environment.\n\nWhile motile bacteria have been predicted to be less affected by the indirect effects of gravity on Earth, such as cell settling, due to their ability to self propel [14], we did not observe any difference between the final cell densities of motile and non motileP. aeruginosa. This is likely due to the fact that even motileP. aeruginosado not swim constantly.Indeed, bacterial motility has been shown to vary during growth [46], where the proportion of cells actively swimming decrease as bacteria approach stationary phase [47]. As such, the difference between our results and earlier experiments withE. coli[9] may be attributed to differences in the regulation of swimming motility between the two organisms under the conditions tested. Together, this suggests that while a constantly swimming population of cells may mitigate the role of gravity, the regulation of motility can lead even cells that are capable of swimming motility to be affected by gravity and to exploit the advantages of the microgravity environment.\n\nUnlikeP. aeruginosaPAO1 cultured under LSMMG,P. aeruginosaPA14 cultured during spaceflight did not form cellular aggregates in planktonic cultures. This observation is likely due to differences in the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) that are responsible for cellular aggregation [48]. Production of EPS inP. aeruginosais known to be modulated by various environmental factors, including shear stress [49]. The difference between the LSMMG results and our spaceflight results may be due to the fact that the spaceflight environment has far lower shear than LSMMG [17]. It may also be due to differences in EPS composition betweenP. aeruginosaPAO1 and PA14, whereP. aeruginosaPA14 has Pel as a primary polysaccharide,P. aeruginosaPAO1 has Psl [50]. Because similar aggregation has been observed withSalmonellagrown during spaceflight [13] andS. aureusgrown in LSMMG [43], further studies of how shear, nutrient availability and genetics affect this behavior may provide additional insights into how different microbes respond to the spaceflight environment.",
    "conclusion": "Our findings indicate that differences inP. aeruginosafinal cell densities observed between spaceflight and normal gravity are due to an interplay between changes in mixing and transport that occur under microgravity conditions and the availability of substrates essential for growth. These results may improve our ability to predict how different microbes will respond to microgravity and how combinations of environmental and genetic factors affect important behaviors, such as growth and virulence, both during spaceflight and on Earth. Here, we have shown that the microgravity environment encountered during spaceflight appears to allow cells to grow better with limited resources when compared to similar conditions on Earth. Considering the majority of bacteria, including those that are found on spacecrafts and space stations, live in nutrient limited environments, this finding highlights the need for ongoing studies of how these effects may affect crew health during long term spaceflight."
