    "abstract": "The extent to which plants can enhance human life support on other worlds depends on the ability of plants to thrive in extraterrestrial environments using in situ resources. Using samples from Apollo 11, 12, and 17, we show that the terrestrial plantArabidopsis thalianagerminates and grows in diverse lunar regoliths. However, our results show that growth is challenging; the lunar regolith plants were slow to develop and many showed severe stress morphologies. Moreover, all plants grown in lunar soils differentially expressed genes indicating ionic stresses, similar to plant reactions to salt, metal and reactive oxygen species. Therefore, although in situ lunar regoliths can be useful for plant production in lunar habitats, they are not benign substrates. The interaction between plants and lunar regolith will need to be further elucidated, and likely mitigated, to best enable efficient use of lunar regolith for life support within lunar stations.\n\nSubject terms:Abiotic, Transcriptomics, Plant molecular biology",
    "methods": "All seeds used in the experiment were from the same batch of seeds fromArabidopsis thaliana(Arabidopsis) ecotype Columbia 0 (Col 0) (TAIR CS70000)48.\n\nThe lunar Allocation Analysis Review Board/AARB (formerly CAPTEM), through the Apollo Sample Curator at Johnson Space Center (Ryan Ziegler), provided 4x1g samples of regolith from Apollo 11 (10084 2075, 2076, 2077, 2078), Apollo 12 (12070 105, 99,106, 109) and Apollo 17 (70051 159, 160, 161, 162) (Fig.1a). An example of an Apollo 12 sample before opening is shown in Supplementary Fig.1A. All lunar samples were of particle size <1mm. These regoliths, along with the NASA lunar simulant JSC 1A (Orbitec JSC 1A Lunar, particle size <1mm), were used as the substrate for plant growth.\n\nPlants grew in 900mg of material; four replicates form each site, alongside 16 replicates of JSC 1A simulant (also 900mg each). The replicates were arranged in four, 48 well cell culture plates (Nunc 48 well sterile culture plate, cat.# 150687) such that each plate held a replicate of each Apollo site regolith (Fig.1a, Supplementary Fig.1B), and four replicates of JSC 1A. Each well is 12.5mm in diameter and 15mm deep. The plates were prepared with the following steps:\n\nDrainage holes were drilled in a specific configuration to distinguish groups of JSC 1A and lunar samples and then labeled (Plate 1, Plate 2, Plate 3, Plate 4) (Supplementary Fig.1B).\n\nThe subsurface irrigation system was created by inserting 10mmx15mm cylinders of Rockwool such that a tuft of fibers extends from the bottom of the drainage hole, which compresses the plug to about 7mm thickness within the well. The plug of Rockwool is topped with a 13mm circle of a nylon 0.45um filter to help prevent regolith from sieving into the plug (Supplementary Fig.1C). Rockwool is a commercially available (e.g., Grodan) material composed of spun basalt fibers compressed into formable slabs. The material is chemically and biologically inert, and widely used in plant growth applications; it could conceivably be produced from lunar basalts in situ.\n\nThe Rockwool plugs in the growth plates were moistened with a nutrient solution of 0.125x strength MS nutrient solution, pH 5.7 (Murashige and Skoog49) by placing the plates in trays of the solution to soak the plugs from below, and then allowed to drain. Next, 900mg of each regolith sample (or JSC 1A) was added to the designated wells (Supplementary Fig.1D), and then the plates were returned to trays of nutrient solution to wet the regolith in contact with the Rockwool plug (Supplementary Fig.1E). The Apollo 17 samples wetted completely through capillary action (as did the JSC 1A controls), however, the Apollo 11 and 12 samples were hydrophobic and initially failed to wet using the subsurface irrigation procedure (Supplementary Fig.1F). The Apollo 11 and 12 samples were therefore actively stirred with nutrient solution to overcome the hydrophobicity, and once wetted, the samples behaved physically similar to JSC 1A and Apollo 17 (Supplementary Fig.1G).\n\nWhen all samples were evenly wet with nutrient solution, Arabidopsis Col 0 seeds were distributed with a micro pipette to the surface of each well (Supplementary Fig.1H), and then the plates were transferred to vented terrarium chambers (Supplementary Fig.1I) to reduce airflow yet allow air exchange with the surrounding environment.\n\nThe growth plates were moistened with nutrient solution daily by placing the plates in trays of solution until the regolith was wetted from below and then allowed to drain. The Rockwool plugs wick liquid very effectively, but also drains readily and does not retain much water. This property of Rockwool helped prevent the regolith from becoming waterlogged.\n\nThe plates of plants were photographed daily.\n\nBetween days 6 and 8, the seedlings were thinned to a single plant in each well by drawing out with forceps (Supplementary Fig.1J). On day 20 the aerial portions of the plants (leaves and hypocotyl) were harvested by cutting at soil level with scissors to labeled micro centrifuge tubes (Supplementary Fig.1J) and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples were stored at  80 degreesC until RNA extraction.\n\nThe above approaches and protocols were based on a set of calibration experiments conducted prior to working with lunar materials. Experiments were conducted in the 48 well culture plate form factor with two JSC planetary simulants (Orbitec JSC 1A Lunar and JSC Mars 1A) and commercial potting soil. All materials were sized to a collection of particles <1mm; the JSC materials we obtained pre sieved to that particle size fraction, and the soil was sieved in the laboratory. The plates were configured as described above with rockwool plugs and filters, and watered from below with a 0.125x MS nutrient solution. The success of this approach informed the lunar materials experiment configuration (Supplementary Fig.3A). The concentration of the MS nutrient solution was optimized in earlier experiments using 200 well seed starting trays. Serial dilutions of 1x strength MS nutrients were compared to deionized water. A concentration of 0.125x MS supported optimal growth in a JSC 1A substrate. Plants that received water alone in the JSC 1A substrate did not develop past the first set of true leaves (Supplementary Fig.3B). Since the nutrient composition of JSC 1A is comparable to that of the lunar regolith used in this study50,51(Supplementary Data4) it was concluded that supplementary nutrients would be necessary for successful plant growth in lunar regolith as well, but there was insufficient lunar regolith available to test this assumption.\n\nRNA isolation and sequencing were after the approaches described in Paul et al.15. RNA extraction was performed using RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's guidelines RNA concentration was determined on Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer, RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Inc.). First, 50ng of total RNA was used for mRNA isolation using the NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module (New England Biolabs, catalog # E7490). Then followed by RNA library construction with the NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs, catalog #E7760) according to the manufacturer's user guide. Briefly, RNA was fragmented in NEBNext First Strand Synthesis Buffer via incubation at 94 degreesC for the desired time. This step was followed by first strand cDNA synthesis using reverse transcriptase and random hexamer primer. Synthesis of ds cDNA was performed using the 2nd strand master mix provided in the kit, followed by end repair and adaptor ligation. At this point, Illumina adaptors were ligated to the sample. Finally, each library (uniquely barcoded) was enriched by 12 cycles of amplification, and purified with Agencourt AMPure beads (Beckman Coulter, catalog # A63881). 48 barcoded libraries were sized on the Bioanalyzer and quantified with the Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer. Finally, these 20 individual libraries were pooled in equimolar concentration. RNASeq libraries were constructed at the UF ICBR Gene Expression Core (https://biotech.ufl.edu/gene expression genotyping/, RRID:SCR_019145). Sequencing was performed at the ICBR NextGen Sequencing Core (https://biotech.ufl.edu/next gen dna/, RRID:SCR_019152). Normalized libraries were submitted to the \"Free Adapter Blocking Reagent\" protocol (FAB, Cat# 20024145) in order to minimize the presence of adaptor dimers and index hopping rates. The library pool was diluted to 0.8nM and sequenced on one S4 flow cell lane (2x150 cycles) of the Illumina NovaSeq6000. The instrument's computer utilized the NovaSeq Control Software v1.6. Cluster and SBS consumables were v1.5. The final loading concentration of the library was 120 pM with 1% PhiX spike in control. One lane generated 2.5 3 billion paired end reads (~950Gb) with an average Q30%>=92.5% and Cluster PF=85.4%. FastQ files were generated using the BCL2fastQ function in the Illumina BaseSpace portal. One NovaSeq S4, 2x150 cycles lane resulted in an average of 50 Million demultiplexed, paired end reads when sequencing a pool of 48 samples.\n\nRNASeq Bioinformatic approaches have been previously described in Paul et al.15. The quality of the RNASeq sequence data was evaluated using FastQC and low quality bases trimmed from the reads using Trimmomatic52,53. STAR Aligner54was used to map high quality paired end reads to TAIR10 genome, and Gene expression values were calculated using RSEM55. The edgeR linear regression model56was used to perform the differential gene analysis. Hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis were conducted to evaluate the association of the samples. The thresholds for calling significantly DEG were set at, FDR of 0.05, a fold change of >2, and the average FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads) for at least one replicate of each comparison group being higher than 0. DEG lists were analyzed for overlaps using BioVenn57. Processing and Analysis of the RNASeq data were performed at the UF ICBR Bioinformatics Core (https://biotech.ufl.edu/bioinformatics/; RRID:SCR_019120).\n\nThe experiment compared plant growth and transcriptomes of JSC 1A lunar simulant to plants grown in regolith from three different Apollo lunar landing sites: Apollo 11, Apollo 12, and Apollo 17; JSC 1A served as the control, the three Apollo sites were the treatments. The plants were grown in sets on four replicated 48 well growth plates, each composed of four samples of JSC 1A controls (n=16 total) one representative of each lunar site on each plate (n=4 total). The individual plate configuration is illustrated in Fig.1. For the transcriptome analyses, four replicates were used for the control and for each treatment (for JSC 1A, plant #4 from each plate was used) in order to haven=4 controls for parity to the lunar samples. However one of the replicates in Apollo 11 did not provide viable RNA, and so for the transcriptome analyses of Apollo 11 treatmentn=3, while the Apollo 12 and Apollo 17 treatmentsn=4. The statistical methods employed for the transcriptome bioinformatics are described in the Bioinformatics Methods section. The quantitative growth graphs in Supplementary Fig.4were derived from the daily photographs of the four replicate growth plates (plate examples in Supplementary Fig.2. The average values of plant size were plotted along with error bars depicting the standard error of the mean. In Supplementary Fig.4A(Grouped by Lunar Site)n=4, in Supplementary Fig.4B(Grouped by Morphology)n=3.

    "results": "To provide insights into the potential for using lunar regolith to grow plants as part of the Artemis lunar exploration science program and for future sustained lunar habitation, we developed a small scale system based on 48 well laboratory plates capable of assessing plant growth in small, obtainable amounts of lunar regolith samples returned from the Apollo missions 11, 12, and 17 (Fig.1a,band Supplementary Fig.1). Wild type Columbia 0 (Col 0) seeds were sown directly on the surface of the lunar regolith (Fig.1c), and developing roots grew in full contact throughout the volume of the lunar regolith. 900mg aliquots of the three different lunar regoliths, as well as the JSC 1A lunar simulant, were arranged in four, 48 well plates (Fig.1b) modified with a subsurface irrigation system (Fig.1cand Supplementary Fig.1). After sowing with Arabidopsis seed (Fig.1c, Supplementary Fig.1H), the plates in their individual watering trays were transferred to clear, ventilated terrarium boxes (Supplementary Fig.1I), and placed under growth lights in a secured plant growth room. Growing the plants in the ventilated terrarium boxes reduced airflow, yet simulated an open laboratory environment potentially similar to a human occupied lunar habitat, as opposed to a sterile growth chamber.\n\nGermination readily occurred on all samples between 48 and 60hours after planting, and all lunar seedlings exhibited normal stems and cotyledons (Fig.2a), indicating that nothing derived from the full contact with the hydrated regolith interfered with the complex set of signaling events required for early aerial development. Between days 6 and 8, each of the plantings was thinned to leave a single plant per well. The roots of the plants thinned from lunar samples were stunted compared to the plants thinned from JSC 1A (Fig.2b), indicating relative inhibition of root growth in lunar regolith. Aerial growth and development beyond 8 days became slower and more variable in the lunar samples compared to JSC 1A (Fig.2c). Although there was variability among the individual plant replicates for each of the lunar regolith sites, there were lunar site specific trends in the development of the plants (Fig.3a). The rate of development for all plants was monitored daily, and the expansion of the leaf canopy was quantified from top view photographs (Supplementary Fig.4). There was almost no variability in the growth rates or morphology among the sixteen JSC 1A replicates (Supplementary Fig.2). Compared to the JSC 1A replicates, all lunar plants took longer to develop expanded leaves, were smaller in rosette diameter over time, and some were severely stunted and deeply pigmented, a typical indicator of plant stress. Only a few plants developed nearly as well on lunar regolith as those on JSC 1A (Figs.2b,3a, Supplementary Fig.2). The JSC 1A plants maintained a consistently higher rate of growth than plants grown on any of the lunar regolith samples, and the plants grown on Apollo 11 regolith fared worse than plants grown on regolith from Apollo 12 and 17 (Fig.3and Supplementary Fig.4).\n\naGermination rates were close to 100% in all sources of Apollo lunar regolith and indistinguishable from rates in JSC 1A simulant. Two representative wells for JSC 1A and each Apollo site are shown.bThe seedlings thinned from each well on day 6 or 8 indicated that root growth in lunar regolith is not as robust as in JSC 1A.cWhile germination was uniform among controls and lunar sites, the lunar regolith grown seedlings did not thrive as compared to the JSC 1A controls. The diameter of the culture plate wells is 12.5mm (scale bar provided inc). All microscope images inbare shown to the same scale (scale bar shown in the Apollo 17 image).\n\naThree (Apollo 11) to four (Apollo 12, 17) plants from each site comprised the analyses.

Genes associated with ROS, salt, metal, and heat responses are indicated by yellow rows. These associations were primarily derived from the stress transcriptomes and data sets presented in References (37 40) and NCBI gene annotations (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/823555).d25 of the most highly differentially expressed genes common to all Apollo sites with fold change presented as Log2. The fully annotated heat map (3C) is provided as Supplementary Data1, and the complete, fully annotated list of 3D is provided in Supplementary Data3).\n\nTo examine the potential bases of the stress morphologies of lunar regolith grown plants, transcriptome analyses were performed on the entire aerial portions (leaves and small stem) of the plants after 20 days. The gene expression data were parsed based on lunar sample site replicates compared to the JSC 1A controls (Fig.3, Supplementary Data1). The plants grown in Apollo 11 regolith showed the greatest number of significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (465), followed by Apollo 12 (265), and Apollo 17 (113) (Fig.3b). All lunar samples, irrespective of Apollo site, significantly evoked DEGs indicative of a strong stress response, with 71% of the DEGs typically associated with salt, metal, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) stresses35 39(Fig.3c). The DEGs that were coordinately expressed in all three lunar sites also included a strong representation (29%) of genes associated with nutrient metabolism (Fig.3d). The most highly repressed and induced (respectively) of the coordinately expressed genes were Protochlorophyllide Oxidoreductase A (AT5G54190) and a gene of unknown function (AT5G26270), which are both associated with phosphate starvation40. Other highly induced genes common to all sites included the well characterized defense genes Nitilase 2 (AT3G44300, also induced by cadmium and metal ions)39, Jasmonate regulated gene 21 (AT3G55970), and Defensin like (AT1G13609), plus two genes encoding proteins of unknown function (AT3G28290 and AT3G28300) that are also involved in aluminum toxicity41and jasmonate signaling42,43. In addition to the coordinate responses, plants from each of the Apollo samples differentially expressed genes unique to each sample location (Fig.3c), suggesting a discernable and distinguishing plant response based on lunar soil sample; however, all coordinated and site unique categories indicated a stress response by plants to lunar regolith.\n\nThe statistically supported differentiation of transcriptome responses based on lunar sites indicated that plant responses vary based on the lunar regolith source, and supported the overall conclusion that lunar regolith is more stressful than JSC 1A simulant. However, the various growth morphologies demonstrated within the replicates of each lunar regolith sample suggested the potential for a range of success states for lunar plant growth. To investigate the responses of potential growth success states, the transcriptomic data were regrouped based on plant size as one measure of growth success (see Supplementary Fig.4for plant growth data).\n\nWhen the gene expression data were parsed with respect to relative growth success, rather than the lunar sample site, even the more successful looking plants (those individual plants that had a size and morphology similar to those grown in JSC 1A) demonstrated strong stress response transcriptomes (Fig.4, Supplementary Data2). Nine of the lunar plants were organized into three phenotypic groups of three plants each: \"Severe\" (tiny with distorted morphology and reddish black pigmentation throughout), \"Small\" (small, but green and well proportioned), and \"Large\" (large with respect to other regolith grown plants, and with normal pigmentation and morphology, close to the typical JSC 1A phenotype, but still smaller than JSC 1A grown plants). Examples of each phenotypic group are shown in Fig.4a, and the left hand panel also further illustrates that germination and cotyledon development is identical for JSC 1A and each of the Apollo regoliths (Fig.3a,4a left panel). The quantification of the growth rates within each of these phenotypic categories is presented in Supplementary Fig.4.\n\naRepresentative plants from each morphology category: JSC 1A control plants (gray), large lunar plants (blue), small lunar plants (green), and severe plants (yellow). Three replicates of each type comprised each analytical set.bVenn diagrams showing the DEG overlap between each morphology type.cHeat maps show the Log2 fold change of DEGs from each morphology type. Genes associated with ROS, salt, metal, and heat responses are indicated by yellow rows. The fully annotated heat map (4C) is provided as Supplementary Data2, and an annotated list of the coordinately expressed genes indicated in 4B is provided in Supplementary Data3).\n\nThe morphologically normal Small and Large plants demonstrated only 130 and 150 DEGs compared to JSC 1A, respectively (Fig.4b), suggesting that if plants establish a near normal developmental trajectory at the early stages of growth, their gene expression patterns approach those of plants in JSC 1A. In contrast, the Severe phenotype plants differentially expressed well over 1000 genes, mostly stress related, demonstrating a severe reaction to the lunar regoliths (Fig.4b,c, Supplementary Data2). The stochastic differentiation into these morphology groups across the three regolith sources (but not in the JSC 1A materials) suggests that plant success is at least in part driven by unique physical interactions with the lunar substrates, and the efficacious establishment of a strong root zone within the regolith. However, even the most successful lunar regolith grown plants that overcame some of the initial physical challenges (the Large and Small phenotype categories) demonstrated stress response transcriptomes (Fig.4c, Supplementary Data2). As in the site comparisons (Fig.3), the DEGs that were coordinately expressed in all three morphology groups were predominantly associated with ROS, salt, and metal associated stress, and most (18 of the 25) were also represented in the DEGs that were coordinately expressed in the site specific comparisons (Figs.3b d, Supplementary Data3). However, there were distinct delineations in the genes uniquely expressed in each morphology group (Fig.4c). In the more than a thousand DEGs unique to the Severe plants, ROS associated DEGs predominated, along with hallmarks of additional developmental stress (plant hormones, cell wall remodeling, calcium signaling; Supplementary Data2). Of the 33 unique DEGs in the Small plants, evidence of ROS signaling also predominated, but genes associated with metal associated stress were almost absent. In the Large, healthier looking plants, over 60% of the 63 uniquely induced DEGs were associated with salt and drought stress, with many LEA (late embryogenesis abundant protein) family proteins being between 50 and 100 fold upregulated. The most highly down regulated unique DEG was ATPC2 (AT1G15700), which is involved in the regulation of ATP synthase activity, which could have a substantial impact on energy metabolism (Fig.4a; Supplementary Data2). The DEGs of the Large, healthier looking plants likely represent the metabolic challenges that need to be surmounted by plants in the lunar regolith, even if the physical challenges of establishing growth are met.\n\nThese data demonstrated that terrestrial plants are capable of growth in lunar regolith as the primary support matrix. Soils derived from lunar regolith could therefore be used for plant production and experiments on the Moon. However, these data also demonstrated that lunar regolith was not a benign growth substrate. Plants can fail to fully establish in the lunar regolith, resulting in a range of growth states and success. Moreover, plants broadly interpreted lunar soils as highly ionic and as eliciting oxidative stress, which is consonant with the prediction that the cosmic ray and solar wind damage to surface regolith would leave it very reactive to biological systems44. Fe oxide deposits resulting from the exposure of nanophase iron to atmospheric oxygen could inhibit mineral utilization in the context of regolith8,45, whereas grain size shape and micropores could influence material surface area to foster an elevated release of ions into solution46. An increase in nanophase iron and a decrease in grain size are hallmarks of mature lunar regolith31,47, such as the Apollo 11 regolith used in this study (10084). Although examples of poorly developing plants were represented in each of Apollo site sources, overall, the plants grown in Apollo 11 regolith struggled the most and displayed the greatest number of differentially expressed genes. The plants grown in Apollo 17 regolith struggled the least, and displayed fewer differentially expressed genes. These data suggest that more mature regolith provides a poorer substrate for plant growth than immature regolith. Thus, although this study demonstrates that plants can use lunar regolith as a primary substrate, further characterization and optimization would be required before regolith can be considered a routine in situ resource, particularly in locations where the regolith is highly mature.",

Open in a new tab a Representative plants from each morphology category: JSC 1A control plants (gray), large lunar plants (blue), small lunar plants (green), and severe plants (yellow). Three replicates of each type comprised each analytical set. b Venn diagrams showing the DEG overlap between each morphology type. c Heat maps show the Log2 fold change of DEGs from each morphology type. Genes associated with ROS, salt, metal, and heat responses are indicated by yellow rows. The fully annotated heat map (4C) is provided as Supplementary Data 2 , and an annotated list of the coordinately expressed genes indicated in 4B is provided in Supplementary Data 3 ). The morphologically normal Small and Large plants demonstrated only 130 and 150 DEGs compared to JSC 1A, respectively (Fig. 4b ), suggesting that if plants establish a near normal developmental trajectory at the early stages of growth, their gene expression patterns approach those of plants in JSC 1A. In contrast, the Severe phenotype plants differentially expressed well over 1000 genes, mostly stress related, demonstrating a severe reaction to the lunar regoliths (Fig. 4 b, c , Supplementary Data 2 ). The stochastic differentiation into these morphology groups across the three regolith sources (but not in the JSC 1A materials) suggests that plant success is at least in part driven by unique physical interactions with the lunar substrates, and the efficacious establishment of a strong root zone within the regolith. However, even the most successful lunar regolith grown plants that overcame some of the initial physical challenges (the Large and Small phenotype categories) demonstrated stress response transcriptomes (Fig. 4c , Supplementary Data 2 ). As in the site comparisons (Fig. 3 ), the DEGs that were coordinately expressed in all three morphology groups were predominantly associated with ROS, salt, and metal associated stress, and most (18 of the 25) were also represented in the DEGs that were coordinately expressed in the site specific comparisons (Figs. 3 b  d , Supplementary Data 3 ). However, there were distinct delineations in the genes uniquely expressed in each morphology group (Fig. 4c ). In the more than a thousand DEGs unique to the Severe plants, ROS associated DEGs predominated, along with hallmarks of additional developmental stress (plant hormones, cell wall remodeling, calcium signaling; Supplementary Data 2 ). Of the 33 unique DEGs in the Small plants, evidence of ROS signaling also predominated, but genes associated with metal associated stress were almost absent. In the Large, healthier looking plants, over 60% of the 63 uniquely induced DEGs were associated with salt and drought stress, with many LEA (late embryogenesis abundant protein) family proteins being between 50 and 100 fold upregulated. The most highly down regulated unique DEG was ATPC2 (AT1G15700), which is involved in the regulation of ATP synthase activity, which could have a substantial impact on energy metabolism (Fig. 4a ; Supplementary Data 2 ). The DEGs of the Large, healthier looking plants likely represent the metabolic challenges that need to be surmounted by plants in the lunar regolith, even if the physical challenges of establishing growth are met.\n\nImplications for lunar exploration and habitation These data demonstrated that terrestrial plants are capable of growth in lunar regolith as the primary support matrix. Soils derived from lunar regolith could therefore be used for plant production and experiments on the Moon. However, these data also demonstrated that lunar regolith was not a benign growth substrate. Plants can fail to fully establish in the lunar regolith, resulting in a range of growth states and success. Moreover, plants broadly interpreted lunar soils as highly ionic and as eliciting oxidative stress, which is consonant with the prediction that the cosmic ray and solar wind damage to surface regolith would leave it very reactive to biological systems 44 . Fe oxide deposits resulting from the exposure of nanophase iron to atmospheric oxygen could inhibit mineral utilization in the context of regolith 8 , 45 , whereas grain size shape and micropores could influence material surface area to foster an elevated release of ions into solution 46 . An increase in nanophase iron and a decrease in grain size are hallmarks of mature lunar regolith 31 , 47 , such as the Apollo 11 regolith used in this study (10084). Although examples of poorly developing plants were represented in each of Apollo site sources, overall, the plants grown in Apollo 11 regolith struggled the most and displayed the greatest number of differentially expressed genes. The plants grown in Apollo 17 regolith struggled the least, and displayed fewer differentially expressed genes. These data suggest that more mature regolith provides a poorer substrate for plant growth than immature regolith. Thus, although this study demonstrates that plants can use lunar regolith as a primary substrate, further characterization and optimization would be required before regolith can be considered a routine in situ resource, particularly in locations where the regolith is highly mature.",
