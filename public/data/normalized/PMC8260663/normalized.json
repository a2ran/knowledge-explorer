    "abstract": "Isolation on Earth can alter physiology and signaling of organs systems, including the central nervous system. Although not in complete solitude, astronauts operate in an isolated environment during spaceflight. In this study, we determined the effects of isolation and simulated microgravity solely or combined, on the inflammatory cytokine milieu of the hippocampus. Adult female wild type mice underwent simulated microgravity by hindlimb unloading for 30 days in single or social (paired) housing. In hippocampus, simulated microgravity and isolation each regulate a discrete repertoire of cytokines associated with inflammation. Their combined effects are not additive. A model for mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) quenching via targeted overexpression of the human catalase gene to the mitochondria (MCAT mice), are protected from isolation  and/or simulated microgravity induced changes in cytokine expression. These findings suggest a key role for mitochondrial ROS signaling in neuroinflammatory responses to spaceflight and prolonged bedrest, isolation, and confinement on Earth.\n\nSubject terms:Interleukins, Physiology",
    "methods": "Female wild type C57BL/6NJ and MCAT transgenic mice were included in this study. MCAT mice overexpress human catalase localized to the mitochondria15. Wild type (WT) and MCAT mice for use in the experiments were generated at NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) by crossing male MCAT mice, B6.Cg Tg (CAG OTC/CAT) 4033Prab/J with female C57BL/6NJ mice (from Jackson Laboratory; stocks 016197 and 005304, respectively). Genotyping was performed using the Red'N Amp PCR kit following the manufacturer's protocol (Millipore Sigma). All animal procedures were performed in compliance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at ARC. The approved animal protocols associated with this study are NAS 16 006 and NAS 16 007.\n\nSixteen week old female wild type C57BL/6NJ and MCAT mice on C57BL/6NJ background were assigned to one of eight experimental groups, and housed either individually (single housed) or in pairs (social housed) (Supplementary Fig.1). Females were selected for this study in part because the majority of rodent studies to date on simulated and actual weightlessness have used females. The wild type groups in this study were the same animals used in our previous report which focused on the assessment of musculoskeletal outcomes and flow cytometry based immune cell profiling in response to isolation13. The traditional NASA Ames HU cage system was used for single housed HU animals77, while normally loaded (NL) single housed controls were maintained single housed in standard vivarium cages. A separate validation experiment confirmed that NL mice housed in standard vivarium cages or in HU cages did not differ in body weights, plasma corticosterone levels, soleus mass, bone structure, and immune cell populations in peripheral blood (data not shown). A custom caging system as we had previously described13, was used for social housed, HU mice (pairs). Social housed, NL controls were maintained in standard vivarium cages in pairs as controls for the social HU mice. Animals assigned to HU groups were acclimated for 3 days in HU cages but without unloading, prior to the onset of HU. Room temperature was maintained at a range of 23 24 degreesC with a 12 h light: 12 h dark cycle. Food and water were provided ad libitum. Nestlests (Ancare) were provided as enrichment for the animals. Animal weights and food consumption were monitored throughout the duration of the experiment. Animals were euthanized 30 days after the onset of HU via CO2inhalation followed by cervical dislocation.\n\nHU was initiated across three consecutive days with equal numbers of wild type and MCAT mice (similar ages) on any given day to accommodate the large number of animals in this study. All experimental groups experienced the same length of treatments (e.g., HU). Consequently, dissections were performed across 3 consecutive days.\n\nThe left brain hemisphere was flash frozen and a tissue biopsy (1.20mm Harris micro punch) from the hippocampus was performed inside a cryotome chamber set at  20 degreesC to avoid thawing. Hippocampal tissue was then homogenized in mild lysis buffer (Tris 50mM, NaCl 150mM, Igepal 1%), Protease Inhibitors (Millipore Sigma)78. Samples were then centrifuged at 4 degreesC at 1000xgfor 10min and supernatants aliquoted and frozen at  80 degreesC until analysis.\n\nCytokine protein abundance in hippocampal homogenates were analyzed using a Mouse Cytokine/Chemokine Array 44 Plex MD44 (EVE Technologies), and concentration standards run for each cytokine. IL 3 cytokine expression was validated by ELISA (Abcam, Cat# ab113345 IL 3). Hippocampal cytokine levels were normalized to total protein content as determined by BCA assay.\n\nBlood was collected from the vena cava immediately after euthanasia. Undiluted plasma was analyzed for cytokine protein abundance as employed for hippocampal homogenates.\n\nStatistical analysis of cytokine expression was performed using JMP (SAS), Version 14.0.0. Equal variance was first evaluated by Levene's test and normality assessed by Shapiro Wilk goodness of fit test. If equal variance and normality were met, a fit model was performed taking into account the three main effects: loading state (NL or HU), housing (single or social), and genotype (WT or MCAT) and comparisons between the main effects done two at a time (two way ANOVA) (Supplementary Fig.1). A two way ANOVA was selected since we were interested in understanding how one factor interacted with one other factor. The threshold of statistical significance for both main factor and interaction effects was set atp<0.05. If interaction effects were evident, a Tukey post hoc test was performed atp<0.05. If a main effect was evident, a Dunnett's test was applied to determine differences between groups of that main effect. A two way ANOVA also was conducted to evaluate the effects of loading state (NL or HU), genotype (WT or MCAT), and loading statexgenotype on the four single housed groups (Supplementary Fig.1). Similarly, a two way ANOVA was performed on the four social housed groups (Supplementary Fig.1). For datasets with unequal variance and/or non normal distributions, a non parametric Wilcoxon all pairs test was performed with statistical significance set atp<0.05. Refer to Supplementary Tables1 13for more info onpvalues and summary of the statistical testing applied in this study.\n\nOn the basis of results derived from two way ANOVA, statistically significant differences in cytokine abundance were summarized in Venn diagrams. As described specifically in each figure and legend, each circle in the diagram represents groups combined according to the various main factors, i.e., loading state (NL or HU, described as Simulated Microgravity effects), or housing (single or social, described as Isolation effects), or genotype (WT or MCAT, described as Genotype effects), with specific cytokines affected by the factors listed within each circle. The intersect of two circles depicts which cytokines were affected by both main factors. A crossbar abutting the intersect of the circles depicts findings that differences in cytokine levels common to both main factors were mitigated in MCAT mice relative to WT mice.\n\nHippocampal homogenates were analyzed for ROS and related products. 4 Hydroxynonenal (4 HNE) adduct was measured by OxiSelect HNE Adduct Competitive ELISA (Cell Biolabs, Cat# STA 838).\n\nPlasma corticosterone was analyzed in 1:100 diluted plasma by ELISA (Abcam, Cat# ab108821).\n\nStatistical analysis as performed using JMP (SAS), Version 14.0.0. Equal variance was first evaluated by Levene's test and normality assessed by Shapiro Wilk goodness of fit test. For 4 HNE results, a linear fit model was created using a least squares approach, and involved the three main variables (loading, housing environment, genotype) and their pairwise interactions (2x2x2 analysis of variance, ANOVA). If interaction effects were observed (p<0.05), a Tukey post hoc test was performed. For corticosterone results, a non parametric Wilcoxon all pairs test was performed with statistical significance set atp<0.05.\n\nFurther information on research design is available in theNature Research Reporting Summarylinked to this article.",
    "results": "We performed unbiased hierarchical clustering of cytokine protein expression to gain insight into the impacts of our main experimental variables, loading state (NL: normally loaded or HU), housing environment (single or social housing), and genotype (WT: wild type or MCAT) on the overall cytokine milieu in the hippocampus (Fig.1). At the highest hierarchical level, samples generally clustered by housing conditions (single or social). Samples within the single housed cluster, formed sub clusters mostly based on genotype (WT or MCAT), which was not observed in the social housed cluster. Loading state (NL or HU) did not appear to contribute to observed clustering of cytokine expression.\n\nExcept for a few samples, clustering generally occurred by housing environment (single or social). Deeper shades of red: higher cytokine levels, deeper shades of blue: lower cytokine levels, off white: no change in expression.\n\nWe first examined the effects of housing environment in all groups (Fig.2). A comparison between single and social housed mice revealed marked effects of isolation in the hippocampus. Eleven out of 44 cytokines were elevated in wild type, single housed mice versus the social housed group (Fig.2aand Supplementary Table3). These effects were mitigated in MCAT mice. IL 6 (Fig.2band Supplementary Table3) is provided as a representative example of the expression pattern evident amongst these 11 cytokines.\n\naEleven out of 44 cytokines were upregulated in wild type single housed vs social housed mice and mitigated in MCAT single housed mice.bRepresentative graph (IL 6) of one of the 11 cytokines elevated due to isolation and mitigated in MCAT mice. Here and in succeeding dot plots, the longer horizontal line in the dot plot corresponds to the group mean while the shorter horizontal lines depict the standard error (SE). Sample sizes are WT NL social (n=6), WT NL single (n=3), MCAT NL social (n=6), and MCAT NL single (n=4). Some data points overlap. A fit model was generated to include housing state, genotype, loading state, and their pairwise interactions. Interaction effects between housing state and genotype were assessed atp<0.05. *Statistically significant atp<0.05 by Tukey post hoc test.\n\nNext, we focused on the effects of simulated microgravity and genotype (as main factors and their interactions) on hippocampal cytokine expression in single housed mice (Fig.3and Supplementary Table4). When exploring the effect of genotype (main factor) in single housed mice, we found differences in cytokine expression (Fig.3a), with 13 out of 44 cytokines showing reduced protein levels in single housed MCAT versus wild type mice (Supplementary Table5). HU downregulated IL 13 in WT mice. Interestingly, IL 13 levels were lower in MCAT NL mice than in WT NL mice. HU did not appear to cause any further decreases in IL 13 levels of MCAT animals, suggesting mitigation of cytokine changes (Fig.3band Supplementary Table4).\n\naDiagram showing the effects of simulated microgravity and genotype on hippocampal cytokine expression in single housed animals.bIL 13 protein levels showing downregulation by HU and further decreased by MCAT genotype. WT NL (n=3), WT HU (n=3), MCAT NL (n=4), and MCAT HU (n=4). Some data points overlap. *Statistically significant atp<0.05 by two way ANOVA and Tukey post hoc test.\n\nIn social housed animals, simulated microgravity and transgene expression caused changes in the expression of five hippocampal cytokines (Fig.4a). Four out of these five cytokines (IL 3, IL 1beta, IL 10, and IL 17) were upregulated in HU versus NL mice, and mitigated in MCAT mice (Supplementary Table6). Results for IL 3 are shown as a representative example of the upregulated cytokines (Fig.4b). In contrast, (IL 12) was downregulated and this effect also was mitigated in MCAT animals (Supplementary Table6). Some of the cytokines showed relatively low expression levels (e.g., IL 6, IL 1beta, refer to Supplementary Table1for full list of cytokines) relative to other cytokines in the panel. These results are consistent with values reported in other studies that suggest biologically relevant effects at these levels of expression48,49. Table1summarizes the results of cytokine analysis of hippocampus.\n\naFive hippocampal cytokines were differentially expressed in social housed HU versus NL mice and changes mitigated in MCAT mice. Cytokine in italics (IL 12) was downregulated while the rest were upregulated.bRepresentative graph showing upregulated hippocampal cytokine in social housed HU vs NL mice and mitigation in MCAT mice.

Some data points overlap. *Statistically significant atp<0.05 by two way ANOVA and Tukey post hoc test.\n\nSummary of the response of each genotype to isolation, simulated microgravity, or both.\n\nThe main figure numbers corresponding to the summarized cytokine results are also included in the table. \"Mitigation of cytokine change(s)\" (by MCAT) pertains to mitigation of all the cytokine changes observed in the corresponding wild type group.\n\naOnly in NL groups; Corticosterone levels in HU groups are not further reduced by isolation.\n\nThe same 44 cytokine protein expression analysis was performed on blood plasma to assess possible system wide effects of simulated microgravity and isolation. Cytokine expression patterns in the plasma differed markedly from those observed in the hippocampus. Figure5ashows the effects of simulated microgravity and genotype on cytokine plasma expression in single housed mice. In single housed mice, HU upregulated expression of IL 20 and IFN beta1, whereas these effects were not observed in MCAT mice (Supplementary Table7). In contrast, HU downregulated MDC (macrophage derived chemokine), which also was mitigated in MCAT mice (Fig.5band Supplementary Table7). Fractalkine showed a genotype effect (Supplementary Table8).\n\naDiagram showing the effect of simulated microgravity and genotype on plasma cytokine expression in single housed animals. Three cytokines were differentially expressed in plasma of single housed HU versus NL mice and mitigated in MCAT HU mice. MDC was downregulated (italics) while IL 20 and IFN beta1 were upregulated.bRepresentative graph showing IFN beta1, one of the two cytokines elevated by HU and mitigated in MCAT mice. NL WT (n=6), HU WT (n=5), NL MCAT (n=6), and U MCAT (n=6). Some data points overlap. *Statistically significant atp<0.05 by two way ANOVA and Tukey post hoc test.\n\nIn social housed groups (excluding isolation as a factor), there was a twofold increase in IL 20 protein levels in the plasma of HU mice compared to NL controls. This effect was mitigated in MCAT mice (Fig.6and Supplementary Table9). Within the 44 cytokines tested, isolation showed less impact on plasma cytokine expression levels than observed in the hippocampus.\n\naOne cytokine, IL 20, was elevated due to HU in plasma of social housed mice and this effect is mitigated in MCAT animals.bGraph showing protein expression of IL 20 in plasma of WT and MCAT animals exposed to HU. Sample size isn=6/group. Some data points overlap. *Statistically significant atp<0.05 by two way ANOVA and Tukey post hoc test.\n\nIsolation affected only two cytokines in plasma Eotaxin and MDC (Fig.7). These cytokines were upregulated in single housed animals and unchanged in MCAT mice (Supplementary Table10). Refer to Table1for a summary of results from plasma cytokine analysis.\n\naIsolation elevates the levels of Eotaxin and MDC in plasma and are not mitigated in MCAT mice.bRepresentative graph (Eotaxin) showing the effects of isolation on plasma cytokines and no mitigation in MCAT mice. WT NL social (n=6), WT NL single (n=6), MCAT NL social (n=7), and MCAT NL single (n=6). Some data points overlap. A fit model was created and included housing state, genotype and loading state, and their pairwise interactions. Interaction effects between housing state and genotype were assessed atp<0.05.\n\nTo begin investigating possible underlying stress related mechanisms, we measured plasma corticosterone levels in all groups (Supplementary Fig.2and Supplementary Table11). Corticosterone levels were generally higher in the social groups compared to their corresponding single housed groups (only WT single vs WT social housed HU groups showed no differences). We previously reported that HU of wild type animals led to increased corticosterone levels13. In the current study, we found that single housed MCAT mice were protected from HU induced increases in corticosterone levels. Interestingly, social housed MCAT NL mice had higher corticosterone levels versus social housed WT NL mice. However, HU in social housed MCAT mice did not lead to additional increases in corticosterone levels relative to the social MCAT NL group. Refer to Table1for a summary of corticosterone results.\n\nChanges in inflammatory status have been linked to differences in oxidative damage50,51. To determine whether isolation or simulated microgravity caused oxidative damage in the hippocampus, we measured 4 hydroxynonenal (4 HNE) adduct levels. Single housed WT animals generally showed higher levels of 4 HNE compared to social housed WT mice (Supplementary Fig.3A, and Supplementary Table12). In contrast, 4 HNE levels of single versus social housed MCAT groups were generally comparable. Further, no HU effect was observed (Supplementary Table13).",
    "discussion": "Although not in complete solitude, human crew in deep space missions will experience prolonged exposure to environments isolated from Earth and larger social groups. Using a rodent model, we assessed the consequence of isolation alone or in combination with simulated microgravity on the CNS cytokine milieu, a key component of the neuroimmune response. In addition, we sought to determine whether mitochondrial ROS signaling contributed to cytokine responses in the CNS focusing on the hippocampus. Spaceflight is known to cause dysfunction in a variety of tissues52 57. Various regions of the CNS are negatively impacted by microgravity and its simulations. For example, 14 days of HU increased acetylcholine activity in both hippocampus and cortex, which was linked to inferior behavior performances47,58. Our results suggest that isolation is an important stimulus that can evoke changes in the cytokine milieu of the hippocampus, with 11 of 44 immune modulating cytokines tested showing increased protein expression due to isolation. We also found that compared to social housed mice, isolation increased 4 HNE, an indicator of oxidative damage. Together, these findings indicate that isolation can alter aspects of CNS immune signaling and lead to increased oxidative damage in the CNS.\n\nChanges in cytokine signaling in the CNS have been linked to neuroinflammation, neurocognitive decline, reduced ability to recover from brain injuries as well as neuroprotective effects. For example, genetic deletion of IL 6 leads to reduced exploratory behavior and decreased anxiety59. Deletion of IL 2 in mice leads to cognitive deficits that resemble aspects of Alzheimer's disease60while disruption of Toll like receptor signaling by knockout of TLR4 protects against age related cognitive decline due to neuroinflammation and apoptosis61. Taken together, findings from our study and others suggest that isolation poses a risk to CNS health.\n\nIsolation and HU led to discrete sets of differentially expressed cytokines in hippocampus, suggesting different immunoregulatory mechanisms invoked by each of these stressors. Collectively, the cytokines differentially expressed in response to HU or isolation as single factors are known to play roles in immune regulation, inflammatory disease and also are impacted by spaceflight. (Refer to ref.62for a recent review on the functions of interleukins and other cytokines). For example, circulating IL 20 protein levels (elevated by HU in our current study) are also increased at the early stages of rheumatoid arthritis and decreased after 6 months of treatment63,64. Further, IL 3 protein levels are greater in splenocytes and thymocytes from space flown rats than ground controls65. In peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from astronauts onboard the ISS, IL 10 is reduced following lipopolysaccharide stimulation compared to controls7. Thus, our observations that simulated weightlessness and isolation provoke expression of discrete cytokine repertoires is consistent with our previous findings on immune cell responses using these models13.\n\nAt the timepoint examined in this study, isolation had a more pronounced impact than HU on the expression of cytokines in the hippocampus, as indicated by differential expression of 11 cytokines as a result of isolation (single housed compared to social housed NL groups) versus 5 cytokines due to HU (social housed HU compared to NL groups). In addition, HU under single and social housed conditions resulted in distinct sets of differentially expressed cytokines in the hippocampus. Taken together, our findings support the hypothesis that simulated weightlessness and isolation activate discrete molecular and physiological mechanisms to regulate cytokine production.\n\nWe found that cytokine responses to spaceflight stressors in the hippocampus versus circulation were also discrete under the experimental conditions used in this study. Further, isolation induced cytokine responses were more extensive in the hippocampus compared to the plasma, based on the higher number of cytokines affected (11 and 3, respectively). Although only a single timepoint (30 days) was assessed in this study, our findings raise the possibility that changes in cytokine levels in the circulation may not mirror those in the brain during spaceflight. The 30 day HU period is considered a chronic exposure paradigm given that it accounts for 4% of an animal's lifespan (assuming a 2 year lifespan). For perspective, a trip to Mars can take about two years, corresponding to 2.5% of a human lifespan (assuming 80 years as the average human lifespan).\n\nOur study is the first to implicate mitochondrial ROS in the CNS and in circulating cytokine levels brought about by combined isolation and simulated microgravity. MCAT mice exhibited protection from the hippocampal cytokine changes caused by isolation, simulated microgravity, and in combination. In plasma, HU induced changes in cytokine expression were mitigated in MCAT mice. In the hippocampus of single housed MCAT mice, both IL 6 and TNFalpha show reduced expression relative to housing matched wild type controls. Both of these cytokines are known to play a role in inflammation (chronic and acute) and in autoimmunity. In the same mice cohort we also found that HU elevated circulating neutrophils and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), suggesting increased inflammation while this effect was mitigated in MCAT mice66. Taken together, our findings are consistent with our hypothesis, highlighting the important role of ROS in modulating systemic and neuroimmune responses to simulated spaceflight.\n\nOur study contributes new information on the regulation of cytokine expression in the hippocampus in MCAT mice, a widely used genetic model for quenching mitochondrial ROS and studying diseases related to aging. MCAT mice have increased mean and maximum lifespan15, enhanced hippocampal spatial learning and memory, reduced contextual fear conditioning, delayed lung cancer onset67, and delayed age related cardiac and ocular pathologies15. Some of the downregulated cytokines we observed in MCAT mice contribute to the cancer microenvironment (e.g., IL 6, INFgamma, M CSF, TNFalpha)67and other metabolic diseases. For example, MCP 1 and IL 6 contribute to the development of abnormal glucose and lipid metabolism68 70. Future studies could be conducted to test ROS mediated modulation of the cytokine milieu as a potential mechanism for the resistance of MCAT mice to the abovementioned aging related pathologies. In addition, our findings and those of others provide a rationale for future investigations on ROS quenching as a potential approach to mitigate inflammaging, the chronic low grade inflammation associated with aging21.\n\nAs we have reported previously, HU increased circulating corticosterone levels of WT mice after 30 days regardless of housing environment13. This effect was mitigated in MCAT single housed mice. In social housed NL animals, corticosterone levels were generally higher compared to the corresponding single housed group. The underlying basis for the higher corticosterone levels in these social housed mice versus single housed mice is unclear. Social hierarchy may exist between pair housed female mice71, which may elevate the average corticosterone levels in paired housing versus single housing conditions. The social MCAT NL and HU groups had comparable corticosterone levels. HU in social housed MCAT mice did not lead to further increases in corticosterone levels possibly due to maximum upregulation of the HPA axis and/or a protective effect by the MCAT genotype. Interestingly, increased plasma corticosterone levels were observed in social housed mice even as plasma levels of an oxidative damage marker (4 HNE) and a subset of inflammatory cytokine protein levels in the hippocampus generally decreased. This suggests that elevated stress associated hormones need not always coincide with pro inflammatory and pro oxidative states. This also raises the possibility that the increase in corticosterone levels in social housed groups is not a pathological response. The underlying mechanisms for the inverse relationship of corticosterone with both oxidative damage and inflammatory cytokines require further study.\n\nFemale mice were selected for this study. Sex specific differences in rodent responses to isolation can occur72,73. In humans, males and females show some differences in their responses to confinement74and bedrest, another microgravity analog75,76. Therefore, future investigations are needed to assess the sex dependent effects of isolation and microgravity as well as any possible differences in oxidative stress responses. In summary, isolation and long term simulated microgravity via HU altered cytokine expression levels in both the hippocampus and plasma. These effects in the brain were mitigated in MCAT mice, implicating an important role for mitochondrial ROS in aspects of the neuroimmune response to microgravity and isolation. Taken together, our findings and those of others provide a rationale for the use of antioxidant based approaches to address anticipated CNS changes during spaceflight and in situations of isolation and reduced mobility on Earth.",
