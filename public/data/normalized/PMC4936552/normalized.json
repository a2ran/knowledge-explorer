    "methods": "Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) ecotype Columbia 0 (Col 0), mutants inAtRBOHDandTPC1in theCol 0background, and theTPC1overexpression line (in theCol 0background) were germinated and grown under sterile conditions on a thin layer of gel (approximately 2 mm thick) containing one half strength Epstein's medium with 10 mmSuc and 0.5% (w/v) Phytagel (Sigma Aldrich) under 16 h of light/8 h of dark at 22 degreesC for 6 d as described previously (Choi et al., 2014).AtrbohDwas kindly provided by Dr. Andrew Bent (University of Wisconsin Madison), andoxTPC1andtpc1 2were provided by Edgar Peiter (Martin Luther Universitt) and Dale Sanders (John Innes Centre) and transformed with Yellow Cameleon Nano 65 GFP Ca2+bioreporter as reported previously (Choi et al., 2014).\n\nConfocal ratio imaging was performed as described byChoi et al. (2014). Briefly, 7 d old seedlings were grown as described above and imaged using a 20x/0.75 Plan Apochromat objective on a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope, with 458 nm excitation, 458 nm primary dichroic, and 462  to 505 nm (CFP) and 526  to 537 nm (cpVenus/FRET) emission selected using the microscope's Meta detector. Images were analyzed using the Image Calculator in the FIJI analysis package (Schindelin et al., 2012), and ratio data from the sequential confocal images were converted to a pseudocolored kymogram using MultiExperiment Viewer software version 10.2 (Saeed et al., 2003). Due to uncertainties in the applicability of in vitro calibration of this reporter to in vivo responsiveness, data are presented as raw ratios of YFP (cpVenus) to CFP signal intensities. Increasing YFP CFP ratio signal represents an increase in Ca2+levels.\n\nExtracellularROSproduction was measured essentially as described byMonshausen et al. (2009). A total of 200 ug mL 1OxyBurst Green (dihydro 2,4,5,6,7,7 hexafluorofluorescein) BSA(Life Technologies) dissolved in growth medium was added to the root approximately 10 min prior to treatment at the root tip. A ROI of 50 x 50 um was then imaged either 3,000 or 5,000 um from the root tip using a 20x/0.75 Plan Apochromat objective on a Zeiss LSM780 confocal microscope, using 458 nm primary dichroic, 458 nm excitation, and 526  to 537 nm emission using the microscope's Meta detector.\n\nFor inhibitor treatments, a small window (approximately 500 um x 500 um) was made in the gel in the middle region of the root, shootward of the root tip, using the tip of a syringe needle as a knife to carefully remove the gel using a dissecting microscope. Ten microliters of 25 to 200 umDPI(NADPH oxidase inhibitor) or potassium ascorbate (ROSscavenger) made up in one half strength Epstein's medium with 10 mmSuc was added to the gel window 30 min prior to salt treatment of the root tip. Control plants were treated similarly, but with 25 uL of one half strength Epstein's medium with 10 mmSuc in the window. To prevent the gel from drying out, these samples were kept in a humid petri dish prior to confocal imaging.\n\nForQPCRanalysis, root and shoot samples of 6 d old seedlings of wild typeCol 0andoxTPC1were harvested in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was then isolated from 50  to 200 mg tissue samples using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) followed by removing residual genomic DNA using the TURBO DNase Kit (RNase free DNase I; Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA (1 2 ug) was reverse transcribed into first strand complementary DNA in a 40 uL reaction (25 50 ng total RNA uL 1) with ProtoScript II reverse transcriptase (New England Biolabs).QPCRanalysis was done using an Applied Biosystems 7500 Real Time PCR system, and analysis was performed with the 7500 Software version 2.3 (Applied Biosystems). The ArabidopsisUBQ10gene was used as an internal reference for standardization as described previously (Choi et al., 2014). First strand complementary DNA proportional to 10 ng of genomic DNA free starting total RNA was combined with 200 nmof each primer and 7.5 uL of 2x EvaGreenQPCRMaster Mix with ROX passive reference dye (Biotium) in a final volume of 15 uL.QPCRwas performed on a 96 well optical PCR plate (ABgene) using the following parameters: one cycle of 15 min at 95 degreesC; 40 cycles of 20 s at 95 degreesC, 30 s at 58 degreesC, and 15 s at 65 degreesC; and one cycle of dissociation from 58 degreesC to 95 degreesC with 0.5 degreesC increments. Quantitation of the expression ofAtTPC1was calculated using the comparative threshold cycle method as described previously (Choi et al., 2014). TheQPCRprimers used are AtUBQ10 qPCR F (UBQ10forward primer, 5 CACACTCCACTTGGTCTTGCGT 3), AtUBQ10 qPCR R (UBQ10reverse primer, 5 TGGTCTTTCCGGTGAGAGTCTTCA 3), AtTPC1 qPCR F(i) (TPC1forward primer, 5 GCTCTATTGGCGTACAGGTCTTTG 3), and AtTPC1 qPCR R(j) (TPC1reverse primer, 5 GAAGAGTGTGACCATTCCATTGG 3).\n\nA full simulation of theCICRmodel, illustrated inFigure 1A, uses Equation 1 assuming a fast Ca2+release. Under this assumption, each release sitexifiring atticontributes\n\nto a reference point at positionxand at timet. The total concentration is the sum of these terms over all Ca2+releases,i,. This method requires calculation of the firing times of all releases and, therefore, places an upper limit on the temporal step size of the algorithm. We typically used a step size t= 10 6s. Concentrations,c, were scaled by the firing threshold,uc,. Simulations were performed with code developed in C++ using the GNU science library root finding function to fit the model to observed wave velocities.\n\nThe following supplemental materials are available.\n\nSupplemental Figure S1.Effects of different parameters on theCICRmodel.\n\nSupplemental Figure S2.TPC1expression in root and shoot tissues of young seedlings.\n\nSupplemental Figure S3.Ca2+wave transmission rate in theatrbohDbackground.\n\nSupplemental Figure S4.Calcium wave propagation in the oxTPC1 background pretreated withDPI.\n\nSupplemental Movie S1.SurfaceROSproduction in response to medium addition to the root tip.\n\nSupplemental Movie S2.SurfaceROSproduction in response to NaCl addition to the root tip.",
    "results": "The experimental investigation ofChoi et al. (2014)highlighted a number of different Ca2+wave speeds in roots in response to chemical perturbations and in mutant lines of Arabidopsis in response to local NaCl stress application (Table I). For instance, increasing the abundance of TPC1 using a 35S promoter resulted in a significantly increased wave speed. Our approach to begin to dissect this system, therefore, has been to evaluate whether there are parameters for a mathematical model of Ca2+wave propagation that can reproduce the empirically determined wild type velocity and whether those same parameters, but with an increased number of TPC1 channels, also can capture the speed in theTPC1overexpression line. Failure to do so would indicate that further elements and/or other mechanisms need to be considered in the model. This approach of testing whether a model is consistent with the available data has the advantage of not requiring experimental values for all parameters (which might be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to determine).\n\nGiven the direct effect that TPC1 has on the propagation of the Ca2+wave, we first considered whether aCICRmechanism mediated by TPC1 could be involved. As discussed in the introduction, TPC1's ability to directly mediate the release of vacuolar Ca2+is not clear (Hedrich and Marten, 2011), and its role could well be indirect. However, one key strength of the modeling strategy is that it does not make any statement about the identity of the channels responsible for mediating the release of Ca2+, just that it is dependent on TPC1 action.\n\nCICRcan be described mathematically through the fire diffuse fire model (Keizer et al., 1998;Ponce Dawson et al., 1999;Timofeeva and Coombes, 2003;Coombes et al., 2004). This framework describes the process in which a quantity of Ca2+, i, released through a channel at positionxiand at timetidiffuses through the cytosol and activates the next channel at positionxi+1. This mechanism has the capacity to create a wave of Ca2+that is regenerated each time a channel opens.\n\nApproximating wave propagation through roots as a one dimensional system, the concentration of Ca2+,u(x,t), can be determined using the diffusion equation:\n\nwhereDis the diffusion constant of Ca2+,  is the release strength, and Ris the time for which the channel remains open. Channels are modeled as point sources that are characterized by Dirac delta functions, (x), in space and by the product of two Heaviside step functions,H(t), in time, to capture the open time. A channel at a position,xi, on the vacuole is assumed to open when the cytosolic Ca2+concentration at that position is greater than the threshold valueuc.This gating value represents the mathematical description of either the concentration dependent binding kinetics of a ligand gated channel or the requisite buildup of ionic charge needed to open a voltage gated channel.\n\nWe assume that the release of Ca2+from the vacuole occurs quickly compared with the time for diffusion between channels, so that we can treat a release as a point source in time (R= 0). For a system of equally spaced channels with separationd, the velocity of the resulting wave is given byPearson and Ponce Dawson (1998):\n\nWithin a cell, the vacuole (with the ubiquitously expressed channel TPC1) typically occupies 50% to 90% of the interior volume (Macklon et al., 1996), whereas plasmodesmata, presumably lacking TPC1, connect cells, leading to two distinct regions for the propagation of the wave in the model (Fig. 1A). In the first, the Ca2+wave is propagated through the cytoplasm surrounding the vacuole. In the case of approximately equally distributed TPC1 channels on the tonoplast, the Ca2+wave has a velocity given by Equation 2. In the second region, the wave must move between neighboring cells. If the mechanism behind transmission in the cytoplasm is a self propagating wave ofCICRmediated by TPC1, then presumably this mechanism will reduce to passive diffusion over a distancedv(the cell wall region) between the cytoplasm in adjacent cells through plasmodesmata. We assumed that this plasmodesmal coupling poses no obstacle to diffusion, so that the model has the best chance of propagating a wave at maximal speed. In this case, Ca2+moving from a cell takes a time,T, to activate the first TPC1 channel on the tonoplast of the neighboring cell. The concentration profile for a single release evaluated at the time of activation of the next channel (whenu=uc) then satisfies the expression\n\nWe assume here that the activation of the first channel in the neighboring cell is dominated by Ca2+released from the closest channel in the previous cell. Within this model, the velocity of a Ca2+wave is determined by the velocities across these two regions. The spatial and temporal resolution of the experiments measuring these speeds (Choi et al., 2014) is insufficient to robustly distinguish transmission through each cell versus the cell to cell component crossingdv, even using the high spatial and temporal resolution afforded by confocal microscopy. Therefore, the transit speed between the two regions cannot be separated and so is averaged in the empirical measurements. For a cell of lengthL, this average speed is given by\n\nThe time taken to cross the cell wall region (Eq. 3) and the velocity in the cytoplasm surrounding each vacuole region (Eq. 2) both depend on the parameter ratio /uc. This dependency implies that, in order to decrease the time spent crossing the cell wall region, the cell must change the release properties of the channels, but this has a corresponding effect on how quickly the wave crosses the cytoplasm in the vacuolar region. We used the measured velocity in the wild type, 395 um s 1, the measured density of TPC1 channels in mesophyll cells,d= 1 um (Pottosin and Schnknecht, 2007), and a commonly used value for the diffusion rate of Ca2+in the cytosol,D= 20 um2s 1(Allbritton et al., 1992), to calculate an estimate for this unknown parameter ratio, /uc. We then used this value to determine if the model can recapitulate the velocity in the TPC1 overexpressor (oxTPC1), 679 +/  73 um s 1(Choi et al., 2014).\n\nCa2+wave propagation viaCICRand Ca2+diffusion through the plasmodesmata can explain observed velocities under strict circumstances. A, Scheme of the model. Calcium is released through activated TPC1, and it diffuses through the cytoplasm a distancedtpc1to activate neighboring TPC1 channels. At the end of a cell (lengthL), the signal diffuses passively to activate the neighboring cell (distancedv) through the plasmodesmata. B, Predicted wave speeds for the TPC1 overexpressor (OxTPC1) for a range ofLanddvusing Equations 2 to 4, where the model parameters are chosen to fit the wild type velocity (Table I). The shaded region indicates 1sdin the observed velocity. C, To account for distributions indv, two simple schemes were tested. A one dimensional array of cells with eitherdv= 10 um (white) ordv=(blue) was set up in sequential order (i) or in random order (ii). D, The result of varying the proportion of cells within Ci with, as described in B, and utilizing a full simulation (see \"Materials and Methods\").\n\nThe overexpressor has an increased density of TPC1 channels, which results in a decreased channel separation and so altered wave kinetics in the model.Peiter et al. (2005)measured the average numbers of TPC1 channels in vacuolar membrane patches in both the wild type and the overexpressor line. With the average channel density measured byPottosin and Schnknecht (2007), we used the channel number data to estimate the channel separation. For the TPC1 overexpressor, we obtained a channel separation,d, of about 0.6 um. Using this channel separation estimate and the ratio /uccalculated from the wild type data, we calculated the expected velocity in the TPC1 overexpressor for a range of cell lengths and intervacuolar distances,dv, covering those found in the regions of the Arabidopsis root where empirical wave speed determinations have been performed (Fig. 1B).\n\nWe see that the model can only recapitulate the velocity in the overexpressor whendvis sufficiently small. This result did not depend on our choice of diffusion constant (Supplemental Fig. S1A) but could be affected by changes in the channel separation,d(Supplemental Fig. S1B). Since our chosen value fordcame from TPC1 channel density data from mesophyll cells and the wave travels through the root, different expression levels of TPC1 could result in different densities of TPC1 on the vacuolar membrane. We tested for such potential differences with quantitative PCR (QPCR) analysis of roots and shoots dissected from plants grown as for the Ca2+imaging. This analysis showed no statistically significant difference between root and shoot expression in the wild type (Supplemental Fig. S2). In the overexpressor, shoots showed a 1.9 fold higher transcript level than the roots of the same plants, so any change in actual channel density between roots and shoots will likely be small.\n\nMeasurements of cell wall thickness in leaves (Moghaddam and Wilman, 1998) and imaging of tonoplast intrinsic proteins in root cells (Werner et al., 2003;Hunter et al., 2007;Gattolin et al., 2009;Guo et al., 2014) suggest typical values ofdvin the range of 1 to 2 um, with values of 10 um and even 60 um in some cases. Due to the variability in such parameters drawn from the literature, we used the GFP signals in the images from the Ca2+measurement data to visualize the cytoplasm of the cells used for Ca2+wave speed measurement and so define where the vacuoles within each cell likely ended. We then measured the distance between the vacuole (where the yellow fluorescent protein [YFP] signal was less than 2sdabove background) in one cell to the vacuole in the adjacent cell using ImageJ (Schneider et al., 2012). As the Ca2+wave speed is constant throughout the root at approximately 400 um s 1in the wild type (Choi et al., 2014), we concentrated on making these measurements in images taken at the 1,000 um region from the root tip to allow direct comparison with the data inFigures 3and4, which focus on Ca2+wave responses at this point in the root. Using this approach, average cytoplasmic lengths between vacuoles in adjacent cells were 4.4 +/  1.2 um (epidermis; mean +/ sd,n= 29), 5.4 +/  1.5 um (cortex;n= 38), and 4.9 +/  1.4 (endodermis;n= 41). It is important to note that vacuoles are dynamic organelles, so these measurements should be viewed as time averaged values of vacuolar behavior, as they are taken from random images across multiple independent experiments.\n\nEffects ofDPIand ascorbate on salt induced Ca2+wave transmission.

The quantitative systemic Ca2+wave is in response to 100 mmlocal NaCl. To allow for comparisons, the no inhibitor pretreatment control is duplicated from A. D, Representative frame images of systemic tissues (1,000 um from the root tip) in response to local 100 mmNaCl with 25, 100, or 200 umDPIpretreatment. Results in A and C represent means +/ seofn>= 5 (DPIand ascorbate) orn= 17 (the wild type) monitored 1,000 um from the site of root tip NaCl application. Bars in B and D = 100 um.\n\nThe Ca2+wave has a reduced velocity in theAtrbohDmutant. Ca2+propagation occurred in mature root, 1,000 um shootward from the site of direct salt stimulation at the root tip. A, Kymographs showing altered Ca2+wave dynamics in the wild type versus theAtrbohDmutant. To generate the kymogram, quantitative ratiometric data (YFP to cyan fluorescent protein [CFP] ratio) were extracted from a region of interest (ROI) 1,000 um from the tip site of 100 mmNaCl addition (monitor in the diagram at top). Starting at the edge of this ROI closest to the root tip, ratiometric data from a 5 um tall (along the root shoot axis of the root) x 144 um wide region covering the cortex and endodermis was averaged and plotted at 0 um of ROI. This 5 um tall region was then moved 5 um shootward within the ROI and the analysis repeated, and the average ratio value was plotted at 5 um of ROI. This process was repeated at sequential 5 um distances from the start point to cover the 200 um region of the root depicted. Analysis was then repeated on each of the images taken for the time course of the experiment (imaging every 2 s). Data were extracted using this approach from five roots and averaged, and pseudocolor coded results are presented. B, Representative images of the time course of Ca2+increase measured at 1,000 um from the site of 100 mmNaCl to the root tip. Ca2+levels were monitored using confocal ratio imaging of plants expressing Yellow Cameleon nano 65 and pseudocolor coded according to the scale at right. Time represents seconds after NaCl addition. Results shown are representative ofn>= 5. Note that Ca2+increase is limited primarily to cortex and endodermal cells in both the wild type andatrbohD, but the increase is delayed in theatrbohDmutant. Bar = 100 um.\n\nTo assess the sensitivity of the model todvand how well the measured intervacuolar distances could support a model that recapitulates measured wave speeds, we extended our modeling analysis to consider an array of cells with different values fordv, distributed either as two blocks of cells (Fig. 1Ci) or randomly among the array (Fig. 1Cii). This approach requires that we simulate the fire diffuse fire process as described in \"Materials and Methods\" rather than estimate the velocity using Equation 4. As before, we use the measured velocity in the wild type to determine the unconstrained parameter ratio, /uc, and then increased the TPC1 channel density to evaluate whether the model can recapitulate the measured velocity in the overexpressor. We asked what proportion of the array must have a smalldvvalue if the largest value ofdvis 10 um.Figure 1Dshows how, even with an intervacuole separation of 1 um, the smallest value suggested in the literature (Moghaddam and Wilman, 1998;Werner et al., 2003;Hunter et al., 2007;Gattolin et al., 2009;Guo et al., 2014) and much less than our average measurements ofdvin the root cortex and endodermis, more than 75% of the cells must have this value to reproduce the empirically determined wave speed.Figure 1Dhas the cells organized according to the scheme inFigure 1Ci, but the choice of cell distribution has no effect on the predicted velocities.\n\nThus, with such intervacuolar distances, Ca2+diffusion would not be sufficiently rapid to recapitulate experimentally determined wave speeds. We emphasize that this model has not included any kind of obstruction to diffusion that the plasmodesmata may produce, which would make the wave even slower. In summary, the range of distances in the literature together with our analysis suggest that it is unlikely that calcium release through a TPC1 dependentCICR driven mechanism alone is responsible for propagating the observed signal.\n\nThe analysis outlined above assumes that TPC1 is distributed uniformly across the vacuolar membrane. Clustering of signaling components may provide a mechanism for selective amplification and channeling of signals that could, in theory, contribute to increased signal propagation rates. Indeed, the observed distribution of channels (Peiter et al., 2005) suggests that TPC1 may show a degree of clustering. The distribution of random independent events on a fixed interval of space or time (such as the area of a membrane patch) follows a Poisson distribution (Riley et al., 1998), so if TPC1 channels were distributed randomly across the tonoplast, we would expect the patch clamp data ofPeiter et al. (2005), which monitor individual TPC1 channel gating in isolated tonoplast membrane patches, to obey a Poisson distribution.\n\nInFigure 2, we compare the measured distribution (Peiter et al., 2005) of TPC1 channels with the best fit Poisson distribution for both the wild type and overexpressor lines. We see that the Poisson distribution does not describe either of the experimental distributions well. A 2test with the Poisson distribution as a null hypothesis indicates that both the wild type and the overexpressor show strong evidence of clustering (Table II).\n\nClustering of TPC1 on the tonoplast reduces the efficiency ofCICR mediated Ca2+wave transmission. A and B, Numbers of TPC1 channels observed in vacuolar membrane patches byPeiter et al. (2005; bars) compared with best fit Poisson distributions (lines) for the wild type (A) and the TPC1 overexpressor (B). C, How the velocity of a Ca2+wave varies with increased clustering within theCICRmodel. The number of channels is kept constant as the number per cluster increases. Release strength, /uc, was chosen so the velocity with equally spaced channels matched the wild type velocity (395 um s 1). The dashed line shows the behavior predicted by Equation 5.\n\nA 2test of channel count data (Peiter et al., 2005) was performed under the null hypothesis that TPC1 channels are (uniform) randomly distributed\n\nTo investigate the impact of channel clustering on the wave propagation speeds, we performed the following simulations. An initial wave was generated assuming equally spaced channels. Keeping the total number of channels the same, the number of channels in a cluster was increased (initially one channel per cluster with separationd, changing to two channels per cluster with separation 2d, and so on).\n\nWe simulated the system with an array of 51 cells (as inFig. 1C) with alldvvalues the same and a cell length,L, of 100 um. This analysis showed that the speed of the wave falls with increased clustering (Fig. 2). The optimal arrangement for most rapid signal propagation, therefore, is when channels are equally spaced.\n\nThe expression for the wave velocity (Eq. 2) explains this decrease in velocity with increased clustering. Treating each cluster of channels as a single release site, with a release strength proportional to the number of channels in that cluster (Shuai and Jung, 2003), the effect of increasing the degree of clustering by a factor of 2, say, involves changing the channel separationdd = 2dand the release strength    = 2 (since we now have twice as many channels at a release site). The resulting velocityv is\n\nThis prediction captures the qualitative behavior of the wave, as shown inFigure 2C. This prediction describes the simulation fordv= 1 um better than fordv= 10 um, because it neglects the intervacuolar separation, which has a much larger influence whendv= 10 um.\n\nIn the Ca2+diffusion model, an optimal distribution of equally spaced channels is unlikely to explain the speed of the observed Ca2+waves. An increase in clustering between the wild type and the TPC1 overexpressor would lead to less efficient signal propagation than the equally spaced channels and, therefore, an even worse fit.\n\nTo explain the observed Ca2+wave speeds, we hypothesized thatROSmay have a role to play. Rapid propagation of a systemic increase inROSproduced by the NADPH oxidase AtRBOHD has been reported in response to stress signals (Torres et al., 2002;Miller et al., 2009;Zhang et al., 2009). RBOHD is expressed ubiquitously throughout Arabidopsis plants and is localized to the plasma membrane of cells (Sagi and Fluhr, 2006). It is responsible for the production ofROSsuch as hydrogen peroxide in the apoplast and is involved in a range of signaling processes, such as in defense (Torres et al., 2002) and in the opening and closing of stomata (Zhang et al., 2009). Furthermore, it has been shown to be essential to the propagation of theROSwaves byMiller et al. (2009). The RBOH family of proteins contain two EF hand calcium binding domains as well as multiple potential phosphorylation sites, which enable their activation in response to raised cytosolic Ca2+(Sagi and Fluhr, 2006). Indeed, the dynamics of changes inROSand Ca2+also are known to interact in the processes ofROS induced Ca2+release and Ca2+ inducedROSrelease (Gilroy et al., 2014).\n\nA conceptual model forROSwave propagation was produced byDubiella et al. (2013), where Ca2+acting via the calcium dependent protein kinase family member 5 stimulatesROSproduction from the plasma membrane NADPH oxidase RBOHD andROSis able to trigger Ca2+influx across the plasma membrane into cells viaROS regulated plasma membrane Ca2+channels (Richards et al., 2014). This provides a self propagation mechanism in whichROStriggers plasma membrane Ca2+influx into the cell, potentially triggeringCICRvia TCP1 at the tonoplast. The cellular Ca2+rise in turn activates RBOHD, which then produces more apoplasticROS.ROScould potentially travel through the apoplast and trigger the same process in the neighboring cell.\n\nThisROS dependent model can be described mathematically to quantitatively analyze whether it is consistent with the observed stress related Ca2+waves.ROS inducedROSrelease can be described by Equation 1, whereuis now the concentration ofROSin the apoplast.ROSdoes not activate a neighboring RBOHD directly but via triggering increased Ca2+in the cytoplasm, which in turn activates RBOHD. The critical threshold parameterucincorporates the indirect nature and complexity of this activation process in one variable and so provides a mathematical means through which changes in Ca2+behavior can feed back onROSpropagation without needing to parameterize the detailed molecular mechanisms behind this process. If higher levels of Ca2+release are being maintained in a cell (e.g. because ofTPC1overexpression), then we would expect the RBOHDs to be activated more quickly, which can be represented in the model by a decreaseduc, irrespective of the precise molecular mechanism responsible for the Ca2+ dependent activation.\n\nROSdiffusion in the apoplast may be predicted to be faster than that of Ca2+in the cytoplasm, as highly active cytoplasmic Ca2+buffering and sequestration mechanisms limit the cytoplasmic movement of this ion (Allbritton et al., 1992); although it is important to note that the levels ofROSin the cell wall also are thought to be tightly regulated by a balance between their generation systems andROS scavenging mechanisms (Krknen and Kuchitsu, 2015). RBOHDs also exist at a higher density than TPC1 (Peiter et al., 2005;Hao et al., 2014). This puts the propagation of theROSwave into the continuous regime (Pearson and Ponce Dawson, 1998); therefore, the velocity of theROS assisted wave has a different functional form than from a purelyCICR driven process, in which it propagates as a saltatory wave (Coombes et al., 2004):\n\nThe wild type velocity can be used to calculate the ratio of the unknown parameters. To test the model, we evaluated the velocity in the TPC1 overexpressor:\n\nwhere alpha is the decrease in the firing thresholducdue to the increase in TPC1 channels in the overexpressor. The number of channels increases by a factor of 24.2/8.6 (Peiter et al., 2005). Therefore, the rate of calcium dependent activation of RBOHD should increase anducshould decrease. Using a first order approximation for this response as a function of the number of channels results in alpha = 8.6/24.2, for which the model predictsv+= 662.6 um s 1. This estimate is well within the experimental uncertainty of the experimentally measured value of calcium wave speed from the overexpressor (Table I). Hence, thisROS assistedCICRmodel is able to produce a good fit to the data.\n\nImportantly for thisROS assistedCICRmodel, we used the average value of channel density derived fromPeiter et al. (2005). This parameter is independent of the underlying distribution of TPC1, being derived from the total number of channels observed divided by the number of samples. For theROS assisted model, only the number of TPC1 channels is used in the analysis, but as we demonstrated with the pureCICRmodel, clustering of TPC1 will tend to slow down wave propagation but is unlikely to affect the inferences drawn from the predictions.\n\nTo empirically test the prediction of aROS assisted mechanism for Ca2+wave propagation, we attempted to dissect the involvement ofROSin the Ca2+wave by treating the root with theROSscavenger ascorbate and the NADPH oxidase inhibitorDPI. To separate the effects of these compounds on the ability of the plant to propagate the wave versus the ability to initially trigger a stress response, we initiated a Ca2+wave by locally treating the tip of the root with 100 mmNaCl in the absence of any inhibitor. The root system of Arabidopsis was growing through a Phytagel matrix, so the local treatment was applied by cutting an approximately 500 um x 500 um hole in the gel ahead of the root tip and letting the root apex grow into this window, which was subsequently filled with growth medium containing 100 mmNaCl. We had determined previously that this treatment localizes the salt stress to the very apex of the root and reproducibly triggers a Ca2+wave propagating shootward from the root apex (Choi et al., 2014). Either 25 to 100 umpotassium ascorbate, 25 to 200 umDPI, or growth medium (negative control) was applied locally 10 min prior to the root tip NaCl stimulation to a similar window cut into the gel surrounding the mature region of the root more than 1,000 um shootward of the root tip. In all cases, the Ca2+wave propagated at approximately 400 um s 1from the root tip to the region treated with inhibitor, but transit through the treatment region was altered depending on the pharmacological agent present. Calcium wave movement through the region treated with growth medium alone was maintained at 400 um s 1. Treatment with 25 umascorbate slowed wave propagation to 64 um s 1, and detectable Ca2+changes were abolished with 100 umascorbate pretreatment. Treatment with up to 200 umDPIsignificantly attenuated the magnitude of the Ca2+increase and slowed propagation rates to 146 um s 1(Table I;Fig. 3A). These observations are consistent with a requirement forROSand NADPH oxidase mediatedROSproduction in Ca2+wave transmission. Furthermore, knockout ofAtRBOHDslowed propagation of the Ca2+wave to 73 um s 1(Table I;Fig. 4;Supplemental Figs. S3 and S4).\n\nOne further prediction of theROS assistedCICRmodel is that loss of RBOH drivenROSproduction in theoxTPC1background will slow wave propagation:\n\nwith alpha as before. This suggests a velocity of 123 um s 1. To test this prediction, we appliedDPIto the oxTPC1 plants and monitored wave speeds. In the oxTPC1 background, a Ca2+wave was still evident after pretreatment withDPI, but the rate of transmission was slowed to 134.4 um s 1(Supplemental Fig. S4).\n\nImplicit in theROS assistedCICRmodel of Ca2+wave propagation is that the Ca2+wave should be accompanied by a similarly propagating wave of apoplasticROSproduction. Although the presence of aROSwave has been inferred from the wave like activation of theROS dependent transcriptional response (Miller et al., 2009), direct measurement of the wave like propagation of an apoplasticROSsignal has proven technically challenging. We used theROS sensing fluorescent dye OxyBurst Green H2HFF conjugated to bovine serum albumin (BSA) to exclude thisROSsensor from the cytoplasm of the root. OxyBurst becomes more fluorescent upon oxidation and so provides a measure of the kinetics ofROSincreases (Monshausen et al., 2007,2009). Therefore, we monitored OxyBurst fluorescence intensity before and after local NaCl stimulation of the root tip at points distant from the site of NaCl stimulation to try to capture the spread of a putative wave ofROSproduction. As OxyBurst shows an irreversible increase in fluorescence upon oxidation, the constitutive backgroundROSproduction by the root led to a slow increase in signal with time prior to treatment (Fig. 5, A and B;Supplemental Movie S1). Addition of growth medium to the root tip (control) led to a slight increase in OxyBurst signal measured 3,000 um away from the root tip site of local medium addition (Fig. 5, A and B;Supplemental Movie S1), which may represent a small response to the mechanical signal generated by medium addition (Monshausen et al., 2007). However, when NaCl was added to the tip, this distal region showed a rapid and significantly larger increase in OxyBurst fluorescence (Fig. 5, A and B;Supplemental Movie S2). Calculation of the speed of movement of the signal triggering this response was made by monitoring the time for a significant increase (greater than 2sdabove prestimulated levels) in the mean OxyBurst signal monitored at 3,000 and 5,000 um from the root apex in 14 replicate experiments. This analysis indicated a propagation speed of 374 um s 1.\n\nExtracellularROSincreases accompany the Ca2+wave to NaCl stimulation. A, ExtracellularROSmonitored with OxyBurst Green BSAmeasured 3,000 um shootward of a wild type root tip treated with medium (control) or 100 mmNaCl (seeSupplemental Movies S1 and S2). B, Quantification of OxyBurst signal at 3,000 um from the tip in the wild type and mutants inAtRBOHDandTPC1. C, Responses measured at 3,000 um shootward inoxTPC1treated with medium (control) or 100 mmNaCl added to the root tip. Signals were normalized to the mean signal for 60 s prior to additions at 0 s. OxyBurst becomes irreversibly more fluorescent as it is oxidized. Results are means +/ se;n>= 5. For clarity, the data fromatrbohD,tpc1 2, andoxTPC1are shown across B and C. To allow for comparison, the same wild type + NaCl and control data are shown in both B and C.\n\nConsistent with the model ofROS assistedCICR, theseROSincreases distal to the site of NaCl stimulation were dependent onAtRBOHDandTPC1, being attenuated inAtrbohDandtpc1 2mutants (Fig. 5B). TheROSincrease did not differ significantly (P> 0.05, ANOVA) from the wild type response in theTPC1overexpression line (Fig. 5C).",
    "discussion": "We have applied the fire diffuse fire model to explore the mechanisms behind the plant wide transmission of stress induced Ca2+waves, focusing on the salt induced wave of the root. Our analyses suggest that a simpleCICR based mechanism relying upon a self reinforcing Ca2+release from the vacuole via TPC1 dependent Ca2+efflux and diffusion of Ca2+between cells is unlikely to account for the observed velocity of wave movement. Extending thisCICRmechanism for Ca2+wave transit through the cell with Ca2+ dependent apoplasticROSproduction to couple between cells, however, is able to support the observed velocities.\n\nROShave been implicated repeatedly in systemic signaling (Alvarez et al., 1998;Karpinski et al., 1999;Miller et al., 2009;Suzuki et al., 2013), and while it is tempting to identify this and the Ca2+wave we have studied here as two sides of the same coin, there are important differences that have yet to be explained. First, theROSwave in response to wounding travels at 1,400 um s 1(Miller et al., 2009), much faster than the Ca2+wave we studied here. This difference might be because the wound inducedROSwave propagates through the vascular tissue, whereas the Ca2+wave appears to be restricted to the cortex and endodermis (Choi et al., 2014). The vasculature is well suited for long distance transmission of signals (van Bel et al., 2014), particularly electrical signals. Alternatively, the triggering stimulus also may impact on propagation speed/mechanism. Indeed, the velocity of the wound relatedROSwave is very similar to that of electrical responses to wounding (Mousavi et al., 2013), suggesting thatROSand electrical signals may act together in the wounding response (van Bel et al., 2014). It is striking, however, that the signal velocity in therbohDmutant is compromised in response to either salt stress (this study) or wounding (Miller et al., 2009), hinting at some possibly shared core components of the transmission machinery. Indeed, both the NaCl triggered Ca2+wave propagation (Choi et al., 2014) and the wound induced systemic Ca2+increases (Kiep et al., 2015) appear to be dependent on theTPC1, reinforcing the idea of conserved elements of the propagation system.\n\nThe activity ofSVchannels is known to be inhibited byROSand activated by reducing agents (Carpaneto et al., 1999;Scholz Starke et al., 2004;Pottosin et al., 2009), and this may at first sight appear contradictory to theROS/TPC1 related propagation mechanism modeled above. However, sinceROSis generated within the apoplast by RBOHDs, it would initially be able to rapidly gateROS activated channels in the plasma membrane. TheROSwould then need to cross the plasma membrane and the cytoplasm before interacting with TPC1. It can take 0.9 s to develop a stable gradient ofROSacross plasma membranes (Bienert et al., 2006), although the maximum theoretical rate could be much faster (Vestergaard et al., 2012). Given the speed of the Ca2+wave in the wild type, it should take only approximately 2.5 ms (TPC1 channel separation over the wave speed) to activate each TPC1 in sequence; thus, it is unlikely that theROSwould have time to trigger a direct effect on TPC1's ability to mediate the initial propagation phase of the Ca2+wave. The slowerROS triggered inactivation of TPC1, therefore, may have an important role to play in terminating the wave once it has moved through the cell.ROS based TPC1 inactivation also could lead to a refractory period where the channel is unable to support further Ca2+increases, leading to the wave like progression of the Ca2+increase.\n\nInherent to the model presented above is rapid triggering of TPC1 byROS dependent cytosolic Ca2+increases. Although theSVchannel has long been identified as being activated by cytosolic Ca2+(Hedrich and Neher, 1987), large concentrations of Ca2+are required (Guo et al., 2016). The ability of theSVchannel to directly release Ca2+also is a topic of some controversy (Hedrich and Marten, 2011), as large vacuolar Ca2+concentrations inhibit the activation of TPC1 (Beyhl et al., 2009;Hedrich and Marten, 2011;Guo et al., 2016). TheSVchannel is known to be regulated by many other factors (for review, seeHedrich and Marten, 2011). For example, recent structural data have indicated a number of potential phosphorylation sites on TPC1 (Kintzer and Stroud, 2016), and the beet (Beta vulgaris)SVchannel is activated by calmodulin (Pottosin et al., 2009). Such alternative regulatory mechanisms provide a wide range of other means for the activation of this channel as part of the Ca2+wave transmission process. TPC1 also could be only indirectly responsible for the release of Ca2+from the vacuole, possibly by controlling changes in membrane voltage that activate other channels (Peiter, 2011). Our modeling approach does not make any assumptions about TPC1's role in mediating Ca2+release, merely requiring that the activation of TPC1 leads to Ca2+release, whether directly or indirectly.\n\nThe knockout ofTPC1that slows Ca2+wave transmission approximately 40 fold only delays the Ca2+response at the site of direct NaCl treatment by 30 s (Choi et al., 2014), suggesting that TPC1 may have a more pronounced role in transmission than in the initial direct stress response, consistent with the lack of an obvious Ca2+dynamics phenotype in response to stress intpc1 2when measured at the whole plant level (Ranf et al., 2008).\n\nThe model presented inFigure 6also identifies two pools of Ca2+that are likely to be important for generating the cytosolic Ca2+wave, apoplastic, with influx through plasma membrane channels, and vacuolar, with influx to the cytosol, through TPC1 or a TPC1 related channel on the tonoplast. Thus, extracellular Ca2+levels in the wall and lumenal Ca2+levels in the vacuole may be other key regulators of Ca2+wave propagation, especially as TPC1 is known to be responsive to both cytosolic and lumenal vacuolar Ca2+levels as described above. While a role for extracellular Ca2+signals is well established (e.g. in the stomatal response;Han et al., 2003;Nomura et al., 2008;Weinl et al., 2008), the potential for signaling related dynamic changes of vacuolar lumenal Ca2+levels remains poorly understood.\n\nConceptual model of the propagation of the salt stress induced Ca2+/ROSwaves.ROS(green arrows) are produced in RBOHD (green circles) and diffuse through the apoplast, activatingROS sensitive Ca2+channels in the plasma membrane (light blue ellipse). These channels release Ca2+into the cytosol (blue arrows) that activate TPC1 proteins (yellow circles), which, directly or indirectly, mediate Ca2+release from the vacuole. Combined, this Ca2+activates further RBOHD proteins, giving rise to a self propagatingROS/Ca2+wave. Passage between cells may be mediated by either diffusion ofROSthrough the apoplast or Ca2+through the plasmodesmata.\n\nOur direct imaging of a spreading extracellularROSincrease shown inFigure 5provides a strong supporting element for theROS assistedCICRmodel of wave propagation. The dynamics of aROSwave have been largely inferred from, for example, the timing and spatial patterning of the activation ofROS responsive promoters (Miller et al., 2009). However, we have now been able to show that an extracellularROSincrease accompanied the Ca2+wave moving at approximately 400 um s 1, suggesting a propagatingROSwave. ThisROSwave is dependent on AtRBOHD and TPC1, consistent with theROS assisted Ca2+wave model whereROStrigger Ca2+increases that then propagate and trigger further distalROSresponses. It is important to note here that although this wave ofROSincrease appears to be moving at approximately the same velocity as the Ca2+increase, this measurement of rate must be interpreted with caution. The OxyBurst Green BSAsensor is designed to be excluded from the cell wall. Thus, this imaging technique relies on the diffusion ofROSfrom the surface of the root to the medium and so likely incorporates a delay in appearance as theROSmove through the apoplast and accumulate in the medium. This caveat is especially relevant as the NaCl triggered Ca2+wave, and by implication theROS related events associated with it, are initiated at the cortex and endodermis, soROSwould need to transit the epidermal apoplast to begin to leave the root. Therefore, although we can say that an extracellularROSincrease accompanies the Ca2+wave, defining whether theROSappear before or concurrent with the Ca2+increases must await the development of improved extracellularROSimaging technology. However, the inhibition of the propagation of the Ca2+wave by treatment withDPIor ascorbate (Fig. 3) and in theatrbohDmutant (Fig. 4) suggests that the Ca2+wave is at least dependent onROSproduction. The residual wave transmission seen withDPIcould reflect an incomplete inhibition of RBOH activity by this pharmacological agent or the action of a parallel,DPI resistantROS generating mechanism as part of the wave propagation mechanism.\n\nOur combination of mathematical modeling and experimental analysis supports the following model for the propagation of the systemic signal in response to salt. Locally, the application of salt triggers the movement of ions between various compartments in the cell, and in particular, the concentration of Ca2+in the cytoplasm increases. This signal leads to the activation of RBOHD via its EF hand domains and via phosphorylation by Ca2+ binding kinases (Dubiella et al., 2013). As illustrated inFigure 6, local production ofROSby RBOHD is predicted to activate plasma membrane Ca2+channels.ROS sensitive Ca2+channel activities have been monitored at the electrophysiological level in Arabidopsis root cells (Foreman et al., 2003;Demidchik and Maathuis, 2007;Ordoez et al., 2014), andROS responsive candidates such as the annexins (Richards et al., 2014) have been identified at the molecular level, although their possible roles in Ca2+wave transmission remain to be explored. This Ca2+contributes to the activation of TPC1, resulting, directly or indirectly, in the release of more Ca2+from the vacuole.ROSand Ca2+diffuse within the apoplast and cytoplasm, respectively, activating neighboring channels until all the involved signaling proteins within a cell have been activated. The signaling molecules are able to diffuse between cells,ROSthrough the apoplast and Ca2+through the plasmodesmata, where signaling in the next cell is activated. In the TPC1 overexpressor, the quantity of TPC1 channels is increased (Peiter et al., 2005), resulting in more Ca2+being released and faster activation of RBOHDs and, therefore, a faster wave. Within thetpc1 2mutant background, RBOHD and the plasma membrane Ca2+channel form a linked propagation system. The observation that high concentrations of ascorbate can abolish the Ca2+wave suggests that Ca2+alone is insufficient to propagate the Ca2+wave; therefore, in therbohDmutant, it is possible that other sources ofROSact to give rise to the lower velocity wave.\n\nWhile the modeling work presented here assumesROSpropagation through the apoplast, we cannot exclude the possibility that Ca2+diffusing through the plasmodesmata is responsible for transmitting the signal between adjacent cells, or indeed that the two species act in tandem (Fig. 6). A TPC1 mediatedCICRwave acting alone seems unlikely, and that motivated us to look atROSpropagation, but the requirement for aROS activated plasma membrane Ca2+channel means there also could be sources of Ca2+influx within the plasmodesmatal plasma membrane itself that could contribute to a rapid transmission event. Unfortunately, the resolution of current imaging techniques is unable to distinguish these possibilities.\n\nTPC1andAtRBOHDare expressed ubiquitously throughout the plant, so their distribution does not provide an obvious explanation for why the salt induced Ca2+wave preferentially transits through the cortical and endodermal cell layers. Similarly, candidates for the putativeROS activated Ca2+ release channels, such as annexins and SKOR (Garcia Mata et al., 2010;Richards et al., 2014), also are expressed throughout the root (Birnbaum et al., 2003). Thus, identifying theROS regulated channels involved with this signaling process, as well as other components that provide regulatory roles, represents a key challenge for the future that may provide important insights into the tissue specific pattern of the Ca2+wave.",
