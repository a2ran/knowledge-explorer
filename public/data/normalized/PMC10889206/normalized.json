    "abstract": "Bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) is hypothesized to serve as an expandable/contractible fat depot which functions, in part, to minimize energy requirements for sustaining optimal hematopoiesis. We investigated whether BMAT is required for immune reconstitution following injury. Male wild type (WBB6F1, WT) and BMAT deficient WBB6F1/J KitW/KitW v/J (KitW/W v) mice were lethally irradiated. Irradiation was followed by adoptive transfer of 1000 purified WT hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). The extent of immune reconstitution in blood, bone marrow, and lymph nodes in the irradiated mice was determined using HSCs from green fluorescent protein (GFP) expressing mice. We also evaluated skeletal response to treatment. Detection of GFP positive B and T cells in peripheral blood at 4 and 9 weeks following adoptive transfer and in bone marrow and lymph nodes following necropsy revealed excellent immune reconstitution in both WT and BMAT deficient mice. Adipocytes were numerous in the distal femur of WT mice but absent or rare inKitW/W vmice. Bone parameters, including length, mass, density, bone volume, microarchitecture, and turnover balance, exhibited few differences between WT and BMAT deficient mice. The minimal differences suggest that BMAT is not required for reconstitution of the immune system following lethal radiation and is not a major contributor to the skeletal phenotypes of kit signaling deficient mice.\n\nKeywords:bone marrow adipose tissue, BMAT,KitW/W v, bone architecture, microcomputed tomography, histology",
    "methods": "Four  to five week old male WBB6F1/J KitW/KitW v/J (KitW/W v) mice (n = 13) and their WT WBB6F1/J littermates (n = 13) were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and used as adoptive transfer recipients. Additional WT and GFP expressing (stock 006567 C57BL/6 Tg(CAG EGFP)131Osb/LeySopJ) mice were purchased as the source of bone marrow and as HSC donors. The experimental protocol (ACUP 4304) was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Oregon State University. The mice were single housed at 32  degreesC for the duration of the study. Housing mice at 32  degreesC (near thermoneutral temperature) has been shown to minimize resting energy expenditure and prevent cold stress induced reductions in peak bone mass and premature (while still growing) age associated cancellous bone loss [50].\n\nThe experimental protocol is outlined inFigure 1. At 3 weeks following arrival, the mice were randomized into 4 groups: (1) GFP HSC WT(n = 3), (2) GFP HSC KitW/W v(n = 3), (3) WT HSC WT(n = 10), and (4) WT HSC KitW/W v(n = 10), and lethally irradiated (two split doses of 5 Gy each, 10 Gy total; Gammacell 22060Co gamma irradiator). One day later, the mice were injected with purified HSCs from donor GFP or WT mice. Mice in groups 1 and 2 (GFP HSC WTand GFP HSC KitW/W v, respectively) were maintained for 9 weeks. Mice in groups 3 and 4 (WT HSC WTand WT HSC KitW/W v, respectively) were maintained for 11 weeks.\n\nPurified WT and GFP HSCs were prepared as follows: whole bone marrow cells were harvested from the femora and tibia of 12 WT donor mice and 3 GFP donor mice, respectively. Lineage negative (lin ) cells were enriched from bone marrow cells using magnetic cell separation with MACS lineage cell depletion kit (Miltenyi Biotec Inc., Auburn, CA, USA). Enriched lin bone marrow cells were incubated with anti CD117 (c kit) and anti Sca 1 antibodies (eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA). HSCs (Lin Sca 1+Kit+) were purified from enriched lin cells by flow cytometry and single cell sorting using MoFlo XDP (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Purified HSCs were resuspended in saline, and 200 uL containing 1000 donor HSCs was injected into the tail vein of each irradiated recipient mouse. The extent of cellular reconstitution of the hematopoietic compartment was determined by the presence of differentiated GFP+immune cells in irradiated mice that received GFP HSC donor cells. GFP+and GFP B and T cells in peripheral blood lymphocytes were measured by flow cytometry using B cell specific (CD19) and T cell specific (CD3) antibodies at 4 weeks and 9 weeks post adoptive transfer. Mesenteric lymph nodes and bone marrow were collected at necropsy (2 days following 2nd blood collection) and the percentage of GFP+B and T cells in mesenteric lymph nodes, as well as bone marrow, were evaluated. Mice (n = 2) that did not undergo adoptive transfer were used as immunostaining controls.\n\nCalcein (15 mg/kg) was administered by subcutaneous injection 4 days and 1 day prior to necropsy in group 3 and 4 mice (WT HSC WTand WT HSC KitW/W v, respectively) to label mineralizing bone matrix. For tissue collection, the mice were anesthetized with isoflurane anesthesia and then terminated by decapitation and exsanguination. Body weight (g), abdominal WAT weight (g), spleen weight (g), seminal vesicle weight (g), adrenal gland weight (g), and blood glucose (mg/dL) were recorded at necropsy. Humeri, 5th lumbar vertebrae, and femora were removed and placed in formalin for 24 h fixation, then stored at 4  degreesC in 70% ethanol prior to sequential analysis by dual energy absorptiometry (DXA; femur only), microcomputed tomography (uCT), and histomorphometry (femur only).\n\nTotal femur bone area (cm2), bone mineral content (g), and bone mineral density (g/cm2) were measured using DXA (PIXImus 2; Lunar Corporation, Madison, WI, USA).\n\nuCT was used for nondestructive three dimensional evaluation of bone volume and architecture. Humeri, 5th lumbar vertebrae, and femora were scanned using a Scanco uCT40 scanner (Scanco Medical AG, Basserdorf, Switzerland) at a voxel size of 12 um x 12 um x 12 um (55 kVp X ray voltage, 145 uA intensity, and 200 ms integration time). The filtering parameters sigma and support were set to 0.8 and 1, respectively. The threshold value for evaluation was determined empirically and set at 245 (gray scale, 0 1000).\n\nCortical bone was evaluated in the humerus and femur diaphysis and cancellous bone was evaluated in the distal humerus epiphysis, vertebral body, and distal femur metaphysis and epiphysis (Figure 4). Assessment of cortical bone in the humerus and femur diaphysis began 60% distal to the top of the humeral/femoral head and consisted of 20 slices (240 um) each. Automated contouring was used to delineate cortical bone from the marrow cavity. All cortical slices were visually examined for evidence of cancellous struts originating from the endocortex and manually removed when present. Direct cortical bone measurements included total cross sectional volume (mm3), cortical volume (mm3), marrow volume (mm3), and cortical thickness (um). Polar moment of inertia (Ipolar, mm4) was determined as a surrogate measure of bone strength in torsion.\n\nRegions of interest evaluated in (A) humerus, (B) lumbar vertebra, and (C) femur.\n\nAssessment of cancellous bone in the distal femur metaphysis began 45 slices (540 um) proximal to the growth plate and included 40 slices (480 um). The entire cancellous bone compartment was evaluated in the distal humerus epiphysis (23 +/  0.5 slices; 276 +/  6 um), distal femur epiphysis (34 +/  0.5 slices; 408 +/  6 um), and vertebral body (169 +/  1 slices; 2028 +/  12 um). Direct cancellous bone measurements included bone volume fraction (bone volume/tissue volume; volume of total tissue occupied by cancellous bone, %), connectivity density (number of redundant connections per unit volume, 1/mm3), trabecular thickness (mean thickness of individual trabeculae, um), trabecular number (number of trabecular intercepts per unit length, 1/mm), and trabecular spacing (distance between trabeculae, um).\n\nThe histological methods used have been described [31]. In brief, distal femora were dehydrated in graded increases of ethanol and xylene, then embedded undecalcified in methyl methacrylate. Four um thick sections were cut with a vertical bed microtome (Leica/Jung 2165) and fixed to slides with a dried precoated 1% gelatin solution. Unstained slides were used for measurements of fluorochrome labels. For cell based measurements, slides were stained with tartrate resistant acid phosphatase and counterstained with toluidine blue (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). All data were collected using the OsteoMeasure System (OsteoMetrics, Inc., Atlanta, GA, USA).\n\nThe sampling site for the distal femur metaphysis was located 0.25 1.25 mm proximal to the growth plate. Dynamic (fluorochrome) histological measurements included mineralizing perimeter (mineralizing perimeter/bone perimeter; %), mineral apposition rate (distance between two fluorochrome markers that comprise a double label divided by the 3 day label interval; um/day), and bone formation rate (mineralizing perimeter multiplied by mineral apposition rate normalized to bone perimeter; um2/um/year, bone area; %/year, and tissue area; %/year).\n\nStatic (cell based) histological measurements include bone area fraction (bone area/tissue area, %), osteoclast perimeter (osteoclast perimeter/bone perimeter; %), osteoblast perimeter (osteoblast perimeter/bone perimeter; %), bone marrow adiposity (adipocyte area/tissue area; %), adipocyte density (#/mm2), and adipocyte size (um2). Osteoclast perimeter was determined as a percentage of cancellous bone perimeter covered by multinucleated cells with an acid phosphatase positive (stained red) cytoplasm. Osteoblast perimeter was determined as a percentage of total bone perimeter lined by plump cuboidal cells located immediately adjacent to a layer of osteoid in direct physical contact with bone. Adipocytes were identified as large circular or oval shaped cells bordered by a prominent cell membrane lacking cytoplasmic staining due to alcohol extraction of intracellular lipids during processing.\n\nMean outcomes for WT and BMAT deficientKitW/W vmice were compared using Welch's two samplet test or the distribution free Wilcoxon Mann Whitney test (when normality was violated). Residual analysis and Levene's test were used to assess normality and homogeneity of variance. The Benjamini and Hochberg [51] method for maintaining the false discovery rate at 5% was used to adjust for multiple comparisons. Differences were considered significant atp<= 0.05. All data are presented as mean +/  SE. Data analysis was performed using R version 4.1.2.",
    "results": "The time course for immune cell reconstitution is shown inFigure 2. Representative FACS plots of mesenteric lymph node immune cells in respective treatment groups showed extensive reconstitution of B and T cell compartments with donor derived GFP+ immune cells in recipient mice 9 weeks following adoptive transfer (Figure 2A). Reconstitution of recipient mouse B cells and T cells with donor HSC derived GFP+B cells and T cells was in progress in both WT andKitW/W vmice by 4 weeks post irradiation/adoptive transfer (Figure 2B). By 9 weeks, excellent reconstitution with donor derived GFP+B cells and T cells was observed in the blood (Figure 2C) and following necropsy in mesenteric lymph nodes (Figure 2D) in both WT andKitW/W vmice. Additionally, GFP+cells were common in bone marrow (Figure 2E), indicating efficient repopulation of bone marrow from donor HSCs. Notably, the magnitude of hematopoietic cell reconstitution did not differ significantly between WT andKitW/W vmice. As expected, the control mice had no GFP labeled cells.\n\nImmune cell reconstitution with donor HSC derived GFP+cells in irradiated recipient mice.

No significant differences in terminal body, spleen, or adrenal weights were noted and there was no difference in blood glucose levels at 11 weeks post irradiation/adoptive transfer. Abdominal WAT and seminal vesicle weights were lower in BMAT deficientKitW/W vmice compared to WT mice.\n\nEffects of adoptive transfer of WT HSCs into irradiated WT and BMAT deficientKitW/W vmice on total body weight, abdominal white adipose tissue weight, spleen weight, seminal vesicle weight, adrenal weight, and blood glucose levels at 11 weeks post irradiation/adoptive transfer.\n\nData are mean +/  SE, n = 10/group;aDifferent from WT HSC  WT,p<= 0.05.\n\nThe effects of adoptive transfer of WT HSCs into WT and BMAT deficientKitW/W vmice on humerus length, total humerus bone volume, cortical bone architecture in the midshaft humerus, and cancellous bone architecture in distal humerus epiphysis at 11 weeks post irradiation/adoptive transfer are shown inTable 2. No significant differences between the WT and BMAT deficientKitW/W vmice were observed for humerus length, total humerus bone volume, or cortical (cross sectional volume, cortical volume, marrow volume, polar moment of inertia) and cancellous (cancellous bone volume fraction, connectivity density, trabecular number, trabecular thickness, trabecular spacing) architecture.\n\nEffects of adoptive transfer of WT HSCs into irradiated WT and BMAT deficientKitW/W vmice on humerus length, total humerus bone volume, cortical bone architecture in the midshaft humerus, and cancellous bone architecture in distal humerus epiphysis at 11 weeks post irradiation/adoptive transfer.\n\nData are mean +/  SE, n = 10/group.\n\nThe effects of irradiation/adoptive transfer of WT HSCs into WT and BMAT deficientKitW/W vmice on total lumbar vertebra bone volume and cancellous bone architecture in the vertebral body are shown inTable 3. With the exception of trabecular thickness, which was lower in BMAT deficientKitW/W vmice compared to WT mice, no group differences were noted for endpoints measured (total vertebral bone volume, cancellous bone volume fraction, connectivity density, trabecular number, trabecular thickness, trabecular spacing).\n\nEffects of adoptive transfer of WT HSCs into irradiated WT and BMAT deficientKitW/W vmice on total lumbar vertebra bone volume and cancellous bone architecture in the vertebral body at 11 weeks post irradiation/adoptive transfer.\n\nData are mean +/  SE, n = 10/group;aDifferent from WT HSC  WT,p<= 0.05.\n\nThe effects of irradiation/adoptive transfer of WT HSCs into WT and BMAT deficientKitW/W vmice on total femur bone mass and volume, on cortical bone architecture in midshaft femur, and cancellous bone architecture in distal femur metaphysis and epiphysis are shown inTable 4. No differences were observed for femur bone area, BMC, or BMD between WT and BMAT deficientKitW/W vmice. Femur length, total bone volume, and cortical thickness likewise did not differ between the two groups. However, compared to WT mice, BMAT deficientKitW/W vmice had lower cross sectional, cortical, and marrow volume and lower polar moment of inertia. There were few differences in cancellous bone microarchitecture, the exceptions being that connectivity density in BMAT deficientKitW/W vmice was higher than in WT mice in distal femur metaphysis but lower in distal femur epiphysis.\n\nEffects of adoptive transfer of WT HSCs into irradiated WT and BMAT deficientKitW/W vmice on total femur bone mass (densitometry) and total femur bone volume, cortical bone architecture in the midshaft femur, and cancellous bone architecture in distal femur metaphysis and epiphysis (uCT) at 11 weeks post irradiation/adoptive transfer.\n\nData are mean +/  SE, n = 10/group;aDifferent from WT HSC  WT,p<= 0.05.\n\nThe effects of irradiation/adoptive transfer of WT HSCs into WT and BMAT deficientKitW/W vmice on static and dynamic bone histomorphometry in distal femur metaphysis are shown inTable 5. No differences were observed for bone area fraction, mineralizing perimeter, mineral apposition rate, bone formation rates (perimeter, bone, and tissue referents), osteoclast lined bone perimeter, or osteoblast lined bone perimeter. Bone marrow adipocytes were common in WT mice but not detected in 8 out of 10KitW/W vmice; adipocytes were present in very low numbers in the remaining 2KitW/W vmice. Adipocyte area/tissue area and adipocyte density were much lower in BMAT deficientKitW/W vmice than in WT mice but the few adipocytes that were present did not differ in size from those present in WT mice. The pronounced difference in adiposity can be appreciated in representative photomicrographs from a WT and a BMAT deficientKitW/W vmouse (Figure 3).\n\nEffects of adoptive transfer of WT HSCs into irradiated WT and BMAT deficientKitW/W vmice on dynamic and static bone histomorphometry in distal femur metaphysis at 11 weeks post irradiation/adoptive transfer.\n\nData are mean +/  SE, n = 10/group; * n = 2KitW/W vmice with BMAT;aDifferent from WT HSC  WT,p<= 0.05.\n\nRepresentative histological images (10x) of distal femur metaphysis in region of interest of a WT HSC  WT mouse and a WT HSC KitW/W vmouse.

    "discussion": "Adoptive transfer of 1000 purified WT HSCs was effective in reconstituting the immune systems of both WT andKitW/W vmice following lethal irradiation. In agreement with prior studies [31,33], adoptive transfer of WT HSCs did not result in accrual of BMAT in the femurs ofKitW/W vmice. Furthermore, the near absence of BMAT did not prevent equalization of most bone parameters, particularly for cancellous bone, between WT andKitW/W vmice.\n\nKitW/W vmice have a point mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain that inactivates the kit receptor in one allele and a mutation in the other allele that prevents translocation of the enzyme from the cytoplasm to the cell surface [34]. Consequently, activation of the kit receptor by a kit ligand is greatly reduced but sufficient to allow for survival. The kit ligand is produced in two forms, as membrane bound and as soluble. TheSlmutation inKitSl/Sldmice deletes the entireSl(kit ligand) gene whereas the Steel Dickie (Sld) mutation, resulting from an intragenic 4 kb deletion, removes sequences encoding transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, limiting expression of the gene to produce only a soluble form of kit ligand [35].\n\nMaleKitW/W vmice, comparable in age (and housing conditions) to mice evaluated in the present study, had lower total body weight, WAT weight, and seminal vesicle weight and lower serum glucose levels compared to WT mice [31].KitW/W vmice also had a lower cancellous bone volume fraction and higher bone turnover in the distal femur metaphysis [31]. Other studies described osteopenia associated with abnormalities in bone turnover balance in femaleKitW/W vmice [30] and male and femaleKitSl/Sldmice [32]. The differences between Kit signaling deficientKitW/W vandKitSl/Sldmice and WT controls reported in the literature contrast with the minimal differences at cancellous bone sites reported in this study following the adoptive transfer of WT HSCs to normalize kit signaling. These findings suggest an important role for kit signaling in bone metabolism. However, they do not identify the underlying mechanisms or target cells.\n\nWe have administered soluble kit ligand toKitSl/Sldmice and have successfully adoptively transferred purified WT HSCs to male and femaleKitW/W vmice [29,31,33]. Neither approach resulted in the accrual of BMAT. However, a detailed comparison of the immune system and skeletal response of WT andKitW/W vmice to the adoptive transfer of WT HSCs had not been performed. In the present study, we confirmed that rescue of kit signaling inKitW/W vmice following adoptive transfer of WT HSCs does not result in the accrual of BMAT in the femur. On the other hand, normalization of kit signaling equalized many of the divergent bone parameters typically observed between WT andKitW/W vmice. This latter finding argues in favor of defective HSC differentiation as the primary cause for the skeletal abnormalities in kit signaling deficient mice. However, the findings do not rule out a role for BMAT in supporting hematopoiesis.\n\nThere is strong in vitro evidence that adipocytes support the long term survival of hematopoietic lineage cells via kit signaling [36] and a recent study concluded that lipolysis from BMAT is required to fuel bone cells and the marrow niche following energy deficits or injury [21]. However, weight loss due to a chronic energy deficit has highly variable effects on BMAT levels in humans as well as experimental animals [37,38]. Decreased weight due to involuntary caloric restriction often, but not always, leads to an increase in BMAT [37,39]. In contrast, weight loss resulting from increased hypothalamic leptin levels results in no change or decreased BMAT [40,41]. Additionally, the effects of injury induced by exposure to ionizing radiation on bone marrow adiposity are highly variable, ranging from no change to large increases [33,42]. This variability in response to irradiation may be due to radiation dose, skeletal site evaluated, or timing of measurement. The latter is likely important because high doses of ionizing radiation result in a rapid decrease in bone marrow cell density followed by gradual recovery [42]. Specifically, following a whole body dose of137Cs (6 Gy), bone marrow cell density declined by 77% after 1 day and 86% after 3 days. However, by 2 weeks post irradiation, recovery was well underway. Importantly, the effect of radiation on cells was not uniform; while total marrow cell numbers declined drastically post irradiation, osteoblast  and osteoclast lined bone perimeter increased [42]. Furthermore, neither bone marrow collapse nor early stage recovery (2 weeks) was accompanied by increased BMAT. In contrast, we observed increased BMAT following a longer duration (8 week) recovery post lethal irradiation [33]. Taken together, these findings suggest BMAT levels are a marker of recovery and argue against the hypothesis that energy stored in BMAT is critical to support bone marrow recovery following radiation induced injury.\n\nThe present study directly tested the requirement for BMAT for reconstitution of the immune system following lethal (10 Gy) irradiation. Exposure to high dose whole body radiation results in a large negative energy balance as well as massive cell death [42,43]. Despite the absence of BMAT, the reconstitution of lymphocyte cell populations in the present study with only 1000 donor GFP expressing cells was similar in WT and BMAT deficientKitW/W vmice.KitW/W vmice are mast cell deficient, and we detected mast cells on bone surfaces in these mice following the adoptive transfer of WT HSCs, further supporting the successful restoration of normal hematopoietic cell differentiation. It is important to note that mesenchymal stem cells are radioresistant and, consequently, bone marrow cells expressing kit ligand are available to support hematopoiesis following irradiation. Taken together, these findings provide evidence that BMAT is not required for skeletal recovery from injury and energy deficit following exposure to high dose radiation.\n\nIt is well established that kit is expressed by HSCs and kit ligand by differentiated mesenchymal cells, including fibroblasts, osteoblasts, and adipocytes [32]. However, recent studies suggest that there are kit expressing populations of mesenchymal cells capable of differentiating into osteoblasts and adipocytes [44,45]. We previously demonstrated that the purified HSC population used for adoptive transfer can differentiate in vitro into osteoclasts but not osteoblasts or adipocytes [33]. We also demonstrated that inhibition of kit signaling with the receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor gleevec rapidly reduced marrow adipocyte area and density in rats, suggesting that maintenance of mature adipocytes in bone marrow requires kit signaling [29]. Further research is necessary to determine whether the adoptive transfer of kit expressing WT mesenchymal cells restores the ability ofKitW/W vmice to accrue BMAT.\n\nThis study has limitations. The present study was performed in male mice. However, we have previously shown that femaleKitW/W vmice are also BMAT deficient prior to and following the adoptive transfer of WT HSCs [33]. Lymphocytes can influence bone metabolism [46,47] and mast cells have been implicated in diet induced obesity and diabetes in mice [48]. Additionally, mast cells participate in several skeletal disorders, including parathyroid bone disease [49]. Further research will be required to tease out the contribution of specific immune cells to the skeletal phenotypes of kit signaling deficient mice. Although we did not include unirradiated WT andKitW/W vmice in the current analysis, the skeletal phenotypes of male and femaleKitW/W vmice andKitS/Sldmice have been reported [30,31].\n\nIn summary, adoptive transfer of WT HSCs attenuated the skeletal differences between WT and BMAT deficientKitW/W vmice, with the notable exception that mature adipocytes continued to be absent or very rare in the bone marrow of femurs ofKitW/W vmice. The absence of BMAT had little or no influence on the reconstitution of immune, osteoblast, or osteoclast cell populations following lethal radiation. Taken together, these findings indicate that BMAT is not required for recovery from severe bone marrow injury. Our findings also support the conclusion that kit signaling plays an important role in bone turnover balance in mice. Finally, the present studies demonstrate the value of BMAT deficientKitW/W vmice as a model for investigating the role of BMAT in bone physiology.",
