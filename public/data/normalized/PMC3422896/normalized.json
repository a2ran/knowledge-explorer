    "abstract": "The 14 3 3 proteins have emerged as major phosphoprotein interaction proteins and thereby constitute a key node in the Arabidopsis Interactome Map, a node through which a large number of important signals pass. Throughout their history of discovery and description, the 14 3 3s have been described as protein families and there has been some evidence that the different 14 3 3 family members within any organism might carry isoform specific functions. However, there has also been evidence for redundancy of 14 3 3 function, suggesting that the perceived 14 3 3 diversity may be the accumulation of neutral mutations over evolutionary time and as some 14 3 3 genes develop tissue or organ specific expression. This situation has led to a currently unresolved question   does 14 3 3 isoform sequence diversity indicate functional diversity at the biochemical or cellular level? We discuss here some of the key observations on both sides of the resulting debate, and present a set of contrastable observations to address the theory functional diversity does exist among 14 3 3 isoforms. The resulting model suggests strongly that there are indeed functional specificities in the 14 3 3s of Arabidopsis. The model further suggests that 14 3 3 diversity and specificity should enter into the discussion of 14 3 3 roles in signal transduction and be directly approached in 14 3 3 experimentation. It is hoped that future studies involving 14 3 3s will continue to address specificity in experimental design and analysis.\n\nKeywords:Arabidopsis, GRF, plant, subcellular localization, 14 3 3 isoform specificity",
