    "abstract": "Agerelated muscle decline (sarcopenia) associates with numerous health risk factors and poor quality of life. Drugs that counter sarcopenia without harmful side effects are lacking, and repurposing existing pharmaceuticals could expedite realistic clinical options. Recent studies suggest bisphosphonates promote muscle health; however, the efficacy of bisphosphonates as an antisarcopenic therapy is currently unclear.\n\nUsingCaenorhabditis elegansas a sarcopenia model, we treated animals with 100nM, 1, 10, 100 and 500uM zoledronic acid (ZA) and assessed lifespan and healthspan (movement rates) using a microfluidic chip device. The effects of ZA on sarcopenia were examined using GFPtagged myofibres or mitochondria at days 0, 4 and 6 postadulthood. Mechanisms of ZAmediated healthspan extension were determined using combined ZA and targeted RNAi gene knockdown across the lifecourse.\n\nWe found 100nM and 1uM ZA increased lifespan (P<0.001) and healthspan [954+/ 53 (100nM) and 963+/ 48 (1uM) vs. 834+/ 59% (untreated) population activity AUC,P<0.05]. 10uM ZA shortened lifespan (P<0.0001) but not healthspan (758.9+/ 37 vs. 834+/ 59,P>0.05), whereas 100 and 500uM ZA were larval lethal. ZA (1uM) significantly improved myofibrillar structure on days 4 and 6 postadulthood (83 and 71% wellorganized myofibres, respectively, vs. 56 and 34% controls,P<0.0001) and increased wellnetworked mitochondria at day 6 (47 vs. 16% in controls,P<0.01). Genes required for ZAmediated healthspan extension includedfdps1/FDPS1 (278+/ 9 vs. 894+/ 17% population activity AUC in knockdown+1uM ZA vs. untreated controls, respectively,P<0.0001),daf16/FOXO (680+/ 16 vs. 894+/ 17%,P<0.01) andagxt2/BAIBA (531+/ 23 vs. 552+/ 8%,P>0.05). Life/healthspan was extended through knockdown ofigdb1/FNDC5 (635+/ 10 vs. 523+/ 10% population activity AUC in gene knockdown vs. untreated controls,P<0.01) andsir2.3/SIRT4 (586+/ 10 vs. 523+/ 10%,P<0.05), with no synergistic improvements in ZA cotreatment vs. knockdown alone [651+/ 12 vs. 635+/ 10% (igdb1/FNDC5) and 583+/ 9 vs. 586+/ 10% (sir2.3/SIRT4), bothP>0.05]. Conversely,let756/FGF21 andsir2.2/SIRT4 were dispensable for ZAinduced healthspan [630+/ 6 vs. 523+/ 10% population activity AUC in knockdown+1uM ZA vs. untreated controls,P<0.01 (let756/FGF21) and 568+/ 9 vs. 523+/ 10%,P<0.05 (sir2.2/SIRT4)].\n\nDespite lacking an endoskeleton, ZA delaysCaenorhabditis eleganssarcopenia, which translates to improved neuromuscular function across the life course. Bisphosphonates might, therefore, be an immediately exploitable antisarcopenia therapy.\n\nKeywords:Healthspan, Lifespan, Muscle, Sarcopenia, Zoledronic acid",
    "methods": "Wildtype (N2 stain) animals were age synchronized by gravity flotation and ~80L1 larvae were placed on 33mm petri dishes (20 L1 per 33mm plate) containing 2mL NGM agar [50mM NaCl, 0.25% (w/v) bacteriological peptone, 1.7% (w/v) agar, 1mM CaCl2, 1mM MgSO4, 25mM KH2PO4(pH6), 12.9uM cholesterol] and seeded with 200uL of OP50Escherichia colibacteria. For ZA treatments, 100uL of dilute compound (i.e.   100uL of 2.3uM, 23uM, 230uM, 2.3mM and 11.5uM intermediate dilutions in ddH2O for 100nM, 1uM, 10uM, 100uM and 500uM concentrations, respectively) were diluted into a 2.3mL plate volume to achieve the desired final concentration. Control animals were grown on plates seeded with 100uL of ddH2O to account for any diluting of bacterial lawns. Animals were grown on petri dishes for ~48h at 20 degreesC to reach young adulthood, then washed off using 3mL M9 buffer (3g KH2PO4, 6g Na2HPO4, 5g NaCl, 1mL 1M MgSO4per litre) and pooled into 60cm petri dishes. From these pooled samples, ~70 young adults were collected and loaded into microfluidic chips (Infinity chips; Nemalife Inc., TX) using a 2.5mL syringe, where the animals remained throughout the rest of the life course. Using the Infinity screening system (Nemalife Inc., TX), on every day of the life course, chips were washed for 90s with liquid NGM to remove progeny followed by a further 90s recording for subsequent computational analysis of animal survival and locomotion. Chips were then injected with ~200uL of 20mg/mL OP50 supplemented with ZA or ddH2O. Specifically, 980uL of 20mg/mL OP50 was supplemented with 20uL of the required ZA intermediate dilution (i.e., 5uM, 50uM and 500uM intermediates for 100nM, 1uM and 10uM of ZA, respectively) or 20uL of ddH2O for controls. Chips were then stored in petri dishes at 20 degreesC for the next 24h with a damp, sterile tissue and parafilmed to avoid the microfluidic arena drying out.\n\nLifespan was performed using the Infinity system screening platform (Nemalife Inc., TX). Specifically, 90s videos were split into three still image frames (frames 1, 300 and 900), and the Infinity screening system automates a bounding box around every (~70 80) whole animal in the microfluidic chip. Using the Infinity system software (Nemalife Inc., TX), computational coefficients determine animal displacements from outside this bounding box and were used for both lifespan and healthspan analysis. Animals were deemed dead if coefficients were <0.01 (no movement) and alive if values were >0.01. For healthspan analysis, movement rate was employed as one of the most robust measures of animal healthspan.25For quantification, animals that obtained coefficients of 0.01 0.40 (i.e., unable to move more than half its body length between subsequent frames) were deemed inactive. Animals with scores of 0.41 1 were classed as 'active' animals (i.e., moving half of, or more than its full bodylength in displacement between subsequent frames).\n\nBoth lifespan and healthspan were determined every day using videos of microfluidichoused populations. Average values were taken from movement scores between all three frames. In addition to software automation, each video was manually corrected for any false positives/box deformations that could skew movement scores. Daily mean movement values were converted to area under the curve to denote total population movement scores across the entire life course.\n\nThe antisarcopenic effects of ZA (1uM) was visualized and quantified using transgenic strains expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)tagged sarcomeres (PJ727 strain:jls01(myo3:: GFP,rol6(su1006));unc54::lacZ V) or GFPtagged mitochondria (CB5600 strain:ccIs4251(Pmyo3:: NgfplacZ; Pmyo3:: Mtgfp) I;him8(e1489) IV). Strains were grown on 33mm plates containing 2mL NGM agar seeded with 200uL of OP50+/ ZA, as detailed above. Animals were transferred onto fresh plates every 2days after young adult stage to remove progeny and prevent population starvation. To image sarcomere and mitochondrial structure, ~30 animals per condition/time point were picked into 20uL of M9 buffer on a microscope slide (VWR Superfrost, UK) with a cover slip placed on top and imaged immediately using an upright epiflourescent microscope (BX43, Olympus Life Science, UK). Images of the body wall muscles were captured from the head and tail region of each animal (avoiding the midanimal/vulva region that exhibits frequent egglaying induced tissue disruption) using an Orcaspark camera (Hamamatsu, Japan) set to 50ms exposure rate and a gain of 3.4dB for all acquired images. Approximately 10 individual muscle cells were scored per animal equating to ~300 muscle cells per condition/replicate and scored as either well networked, moderately fragmented or severely fragmented muscle sarcomere or mitochondria structures as previously described26(seeFigureS1for representative images of each class of structural defect). Analysis was carried out in ImageJ, and the number of well networked, moderately fragmented or severely fragmented muscles were expressed as a percentage of total muscle cells visible and analysed within each animal.\n\nThe effects of RNAi treatments on animal lifespan/healthspan were determined using bacterial feeding vectors and performed in the Infinity screening system, as described above. All bacterial lawns expressing doublestranded RNA were grown from the MRC Ahringer Library of bacterial clones to target (fdps1: R06C1.2; daf16: R13H8.1; agxt2: T09B4.8; igdb1: T04A11.3; let756: C05D11.4; sir2.2: F46G10.7: sir2.3: F46G10.3). Each clone was streaked onto LB plates supplemented with 50ug/mL ampicillin and 25ug/mL carbenicillin and grown overnight at 37 degreesC. Single colonies were then picked into sterile LB broth supplemented with 50ug/mL ampicillin and grown for 16h with shaking at 180rpm at 37 degreesC. After 16h incubation, 0.4mM isopropyl betad1thiogalactopyranoside was added for RNAi induction, with further shaking at 180rpm for 2h at 37 degreesC as described previously.27After 18h incubation, tubes were spun at 3000gfor 10min to obtain bacterial pellets. Liquid NGM was added to each bacterial pellet to reach a final bacteria concentration of 20mg/mL, adding isopropyl betad1thiogalactopyranoside to a final 1mM concentration before use. For combined ZA treatments, the same bacterial preparation was performed, but with 20uL of dilute ZA supplemented to 1mL of 20mg/mL OP50 in NGM for a final concentration of 1uM. On every day of the life course, after washing/recording using the Infinity system as detailed above, ~200uL of RNAi bacteria+/ ZA (1uM) was injected into the microfluidic chips before storing in petri dishes at 20 degreesC for 24h until washing/refeeding the next day (with drug dilution/control). All bacteria and drug solutions were prepared fresh daily until cessation of life. RNAi experiments were always conducted alongside empty vector controls (PL4440).\n\nLifespan analysis was performed using Kaplan Meier curves assessed by the logrank (Mantell Cox) test. Multiple comparisons of survival curves were performed manually using the Bonferronicorrected threshold. For movement rate, area under the curve (AUC) was performed on mean movement values across each day of adulthood (averages taken from across all three frames). AUC values and standard deviations obtained from replicate screens were then assessed by oneway ANOVA in GraphPad, Prism. Both mitochondrial and sarcomere quantification were analysed by twoway ANOVA using the percentage classification score from individual animals across biological repeats. All statistics were performed in GraphPad, Prism (San Diego, California USA).",
    "results": "Higher ZA concentrations (500 and 100uM) were larval lethal, and 10uM ZA shortened lifespan (median survival=11 vs. 14days for controls,P<0.0001;Figure1A) without significantly impairing healthspan (animal movement AUC=758.9+/ 37.08 vs. 833.9+/ 59.91 for controls,P>0.05;Figure1A). Conversely, lifespan extension was observed with lower ZA doses of 1uM (median survival=16days,P<0.001;Figure1B) and 100nM (median survival=16days,P<0.0001;Figure1C). These lifespanpromoting ZA doses also associated with healthspan extension at 1uM (AUC=963.1+/ 48.74,P<0.05;Figure1B) and 100nM (AUC=953.8+/ 53.77,P<0.05;Figure1C) treatments. Additionally, significant movement decline onset became apparent in day 9 control animals (P>0.01 vs. day 1 adults), which was upheld across all ZA treatment doses at this single time point (+22.2, +31.8 and +17.6% population activity on day 9 vs. untreated controls in 10uM, 1uM and 100nM, respectively). ZA thus acts dosedependently to augment animal longevity and health across the life course.\n\nZoledronic acid acts dosedependently to improveC.eleganssurvival and movement capacity. (A) Animals exposed to 10uM zoledronic acid (ZA) exhibit significant declines in survivability (top) to untreated controls (median survival: 10 vs. 14days, respectively,P<0.0001), however, show no significant impairment in movement capacity (bottom) across whole life (P=0.208). Conversely, both 1uM (B) and 100nM (C) were beneficial to animal survival (1uM median survival: 16days,P<0.001; 100nM: 16days,P<0.0001), with paralleled improvements in movement capacity throughout the life course. (D) Graphical overlay of lifespan curves from each ZA concentration versus untreated controls. (E) Overlay of life course movement rates between ZA doses displayed as % mean AUC. Data are mean+SEM of three biological repeats, with ~225 300 animals per condition/time point. Asterisks denote significance to N2 controls. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001, ****P<0.0001.\n\nTo understand the effects of ZA on progressive sarcomere dystrophy across age, transgenicC.elegansexpressing GFPtagged myosin were treated with 1uM ZA. Corroborating previous reports on the temporal agerelated loss of subcellular muscle structures,22untreated wildtype animals displayed a significant  35.6% decline in organized myofibrillar structure by day 4 postadulthood (P<0.0001;Figure2A,B), which worsened to  58.0% by day 6 postadulthood (P<0.0001). ZA delayed loss of organized sarcomeres until day 6 postadulthood ( 15.6%,P<0.01), and significantly increased the number of muscle cells displaying organized sarcomeres versus untreated controls at days 4 (83.9% vs. 54.4%) and 6 (71.1% vs. 31.4%) postadulthood (bothP<0.0001,Figure2A,B). ZA also decreased muscle cells categorized as 'moderately disorganized' on days 4 (17.0% vs. 38.2%,P<0.01) and 6 (27.6 vs. 53.4%,P<0.0001) postadulthood and reduced the number of 'severely disorganized' muscles on day 6 postadulthood (1.8% vs. 13.1%,P<0.0001).\n\nZoledronic acid attenuates agerelated loss of sarcomere integrity. (A) Onset of myofibrillar disorganization occurred at days 4 and 6 postadulthood in untreated animals and was significantly attenuated in zoledronic treated (1uM) animals (allP<0.0001). (B) Representative images of untreated (top) and zoledronic acid treated (bottom) myofibres. Data are means of two biological repeats, with ~50 60 animals per condition/time point, and images taken from head and tail regions of each animal (~120 150 muscle cells per condition/time point). Asterisks denote significance between zoledronic acid and untreated animals within each structural category (**P<0.01,****P<0.0001). '' denotes significant loss of myofibrillar structure for withincondition comparisons versus day 0 values (P<0.001,P<0.0001).\n\nWe next examined the effects of ZA on mitochondrial integrity, given the strong associations of mitochondrial structure and function with ageing animal health. In line with previous wildtype ageing studies,22loss of networked mitochondria occurred by day 2 postadulthood (FigureS2), which progressively worsened at day 4 ( 42.6%,P<0.0001) and day 6 postadulthood ( 67.0%,P<0.0001;Figure3A,B). ZA treatment did not delay the onset of wellnetworked mitochondria loss at day 2 (FigureS2) or day 4 postadulthood (51.8%,P<0.0001). However, ZA prevented progressive mitochondrial fragmentation at day 6 postadulthood (46.7%,P>0.05 vs. day 4), which was also significantly higher than in untreated animals (46.7 vs. 16.1%,P<0.01).\n\nZoledronic acid attenuates agerelated loss of muscle mitochondrial structure. (A) Untreated animals displayed progressive declines in wellnetworked mitochondria across days 0, 4 and 6 postadulthood (for each time point,P<0.0001). Zoledronic acid treatment (1uM) animals saw a similar decline by day 4; however, no further decline was evident by day 6 postadulthood, showing significant improvement when compared to untreated animals at this time point (P<0.01). (B) Representative images of untreated (top) and zoledronic acid treated (bottom) data are means of two biological repeats with ~50 60 animals per condition/time point, and images taken from head and tail regions of each animal (~120 150 muscle cells per condition/time point). Asterisks denote significance between zoledronic acid and untreated animals within each structural category (**P<0.01). '' denotes significant loss of myofibrillar structure for withincondition comparisons versus day 0 values (P<0.0001).\n\nThe lifespan extending effects of ZA have previously been attributed to the mevalonate cholesterol/isoprenoid lipid biosynthesis pathway and the FOXO family of transcription factors,21but their role in ZAinduced healthspan extension is unknown. RNAi knockdown (KD) offdps1, an orthologue of farnesyl diphosphate synthetase involved in the biosynthesis of farnesyl diphosphate intermediates from mevalonate, impaired survival (median survival=6 vs. 14days for controls,P<0.0001) and healthspan (AUC=287+/ 9 vs. 894+/ 17% population activity for controls,P<0.0001), which was not improved by cotreatment with 1uM ZA (Figure4A). Similarly, RNAi KD of thedaf16/FOXO stress response pathway impaired survivability (median survival=12 vs. 14days for controls,P<0.0001) and healthspan (AUC=680.5+/ 23.6 vs. 894.2+/ 17.4 for empty vector,P<0.01) and prevented the beneficial effects of ZA treatment (Figure4B).\n\nFDPS, FOXO and BAIBA orthologues are required for the healthspan effects of zoledronic acid. Knockdown ofFDPS1(FDPS) with ZA cotreatment (1uM) prevents ZA mediated lifespan (top) and healthspan (bottom) extension (A). Similarly, knockdown ofdaf16(FOXO) decreases survival and movement, with no improvement with ZA cotreatment (B). The conserved bonemuscle orthologagxt2(BAIBA) is required for ZA mediated improvement in survival and movement (C). Data are mean+SD of two repeats, with ~140 160 animals per condition/time point. Asterisks denote significance to empty vector.**P<0.01,****P<0.0001.\n\nThe FOXO pathway is a global stress response system, inducible by a wide array of stimuli and a generic transcription factor regulating cellular responses across multiple drug families28that integrates multiple upstream signals to influence worm ageing.29Alternative, musclecentric mechanisms thus also likely contribute to the healthspan benefits of ZA. To probe potential musclederived mechanisms of ZAinduced healthspan extension, we examined the role of three putative myokines that exhibit altered expression across age and implicated in musclebone crosstalk:agxt2/BAIBA,igdb1/FNDC5 andlet756/FGF21.24Lifespan and healthspan were unaffected by KD ofagxt2/BAIBA (betaaminoisobutyric acid), a muscleborne bone protective factor30; however, combinedagxt2KD with ZA treatment was unable to confer life/healthspan extension (Figure4C). Conversely, the inhibition ofigdb1extended lifespan (median survival=11 vs. 7days for controls,P<0.05) and improved healthspan (AUC=634.5+/ 10.5 vs. 523+/ 10.0 for controls,P<0.01), with similar life/healthspan extension observed upon cotreatment with ZA (Figure5A). Additionally,let756appears dispensable for ZAinduced healthspan effects: KD alone caused no significant alterations in survival or movement, whereas increased lifespan and healthspan was retained with combinedlet756KD and ZA treatment (Figure5B).\n\nGenes either dispensable, or that associate with ZA's healthspan effects. Knockdown ofigdb1(FNDC5) significantly increased survival and healthspan, where ZA cotreatment (1uM) was not synergistic, but displayed similar improvements in lifespan (top) and healthspan (bottom) suggestingigdb1might exhibit ZAinduced downregulation (A), or act independently to increase healthspan. Conversely,let756(FGF21, B) is dispensable for both lifespan and healthspan extension with ZA. The mitochondrial sirtuins displayed opposing effects;sir2.2(SIRT4, C) is dispensable for ZA's healthspan effects, whereassir2.3(SIRT4) knockdown increased survival and movement (D), as did ZA cotreatment, suggestingsir2.3downregulation might mediate ZA's healthspan effects. Asterisks denote significance to empty vector controls. *P<0.05,**P<0.01,****P<0.0001. '#' denote significance between ZA cotreatments and gene inhibition alone.#P<0.05,##P<0.01.\n\nRecent rodent work shows bisphosphonates attenuate denervationinduced muscle atrophy via downregulation of sirtuin3 (SIRT3), one of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)dependent deacetylase family members.19Because SIRT3 is primarily mitochondrially localized,31we examined the role of twoC.elegansmitochondrial sirtuins,sir2.2andsir2.3,32for their role in ZAmediated lifespan and healthspan extension. Reinforcing a mitochondrial role ofsir2.2andsir2.3, RNAi KD of each gene caused increased mitochondrial fragmentation at day 0 postadulthood (FigureS3). Whilesir2.2KD did not alter animal survival or healthspan, loss ofsir2.2blocked ZA's life extending properties but ZAinduced healthspan extension remained (Figure5C). Additionally, and in line with previous reports inC.elegans,33we find that knockdown ofsir2.3extends lifespan (Figure5D) and healthspan (Figure5H), which remains with combined ZA treatment but is not synergistically beneficial.",
    "discussion": "Despite the socioeconomic implications, treatment options for sarcopenia remain mostly limited to modifiable lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise, which are incompletely effective.34Complementary drug interventions would, therefore, benefit a significant portion of the ageing population, yet effectual compounds that are safe for longterm use remain elusive. Identifying drugs in clinical use and repurposing for sarcopenia indications could provide immediately exploitable pharmaceuticals for the general population. Bisphosphonates have been used to safely treat osteoporosis for decades.35Here, we report that bisphosphonates (ZA) extendC.eleganslifespan and healthspan, which associates with delayed onset of muscle sarcomere and mitochondrial decline. While general stress response pathways, such as FOXO, regulate these positive healthspan responses to ZA, we establish musclecentric myokines (agxt2andigdb1) and mitochondrial sirtuin (sir2.3) as previously unknown regulators of bisphosphonate effects on ageing muscle health.\n\nGrowing preclinical17,18,19and human20evidence suggest that bisphosphonates not only preserve bone integrity but also exert muscle promoting effects across a variety of conditions. A recent study in fruit flies suggest similar effects might extend to the ageing process, where bisphosphonate treatment prolonged lifespan and animal healthspan.21We provide the firstin vivoevidence for a direct role of chronic bisphosphonate administration in delaying agerelated muscle structural decline. Because ageing muscle architectural alterations are a hallmark of human sarcopenia that relate to lowered motility in animals,22bisphosphonatemediated sarcomere preservation could translate to reduced sarcopenia in higher animals and people. ZA also attenuated ageing muscle mitochondrial decline. Mitochondrial health is strongly linked with sarcopenic progression across species and mitochondrial structure corresponds with oxidative function23; therefore, bisphosphonates might hold dual, and possibly interrelated, efficacy for maintaining muscle metabolic health and sarcomeric integrity. While we assessed animals at, and beyond, the point of onset of agerelated submuscular decline, the antisarcopenic efficacy of bisphosphonates into very old age remains to be determined. Nonetheless, using our microfluidic healthspan device27and animal movement rate as a robust index of health,25we demonstrate that early to midlife muscle preservation translates to improved animal health across the entire life course. Bisphosphonates thus represent a promising strategy for maintaining muscle, and whole animal health into older age.\n\nIn fruit flies, bisphosphonates increase lifespan through inhibition of the mevalonate metabolic pathway and downstream FOXO activation.21We extend this by implicating the mevalonateFOXO system as necessary for bisphosphonatemediated health improvements across the life course. The sterol and nonsterol isoprenoids synthesized via mevalonate localize to plasma membranes and influence several vital cellular processes, the dysfunction of which associate with wide ranging pathologies including cardiovascular disease, autoimmune disease, cancer and Alzheimer's disease.36Our data suggest that sarcopenia can be added to this list, whereby knockdown of a key enzyme in mevalonate metabolism, farnesyl diphosphate synthetase (fdps1), allows normal larval development to adulthood and young adult (day 1) movement rates, corroborating earlier reports of normal L4 larvae muscle architecture uponfdps1RNAi.37Thereafter, downregulation offdps1causes rapid neuromuscular functional decline (i.e., animal motility), likely indicative of accelerated sarcopenia. Because zoledronic acid is unable to improve lifespan and healthspan infdps1ordaf16knockdown animals, the mevalonateFOXO pathway is strongly implicated in the ageing neuromuscular health benefits of bisphosphonates.\n\nBidirectional communication between muscle and bone has long been established, including mechanical coupling and endocrine musclebone signalling.13,24We, therefore, examined the mechanistic role of three putative musclederived signalling factors ('myokines') involved in musclebone crosstalk that exhibit altered agerelated function.24Of these,agxt2/BAIBA was necessary for the positive healthspan effects of ZA, whileagxt2KD alone was not harmful to animal longevity or health. BAIBA promotes insulin sensitivity, antiinflammation38and osteocyte survival in mice,39and its expression does not decline with age39; thus, BAIBAmediated muscle/health benefits of bisphosphonates would be anticipated to remain in older age. Knockdown ofigdb1/FNDC5 extended worm lifespan and healthspan, countering human studies implicating low circulating FNDC5 as a sarcopenia biomarker.40The healthspan effects ofigdb1KD were also comparable with ZA cotreatment. This inability ofidgb1KD to neither ablate nor synergistically augment the positive effects of ZA could be interpreted as ZA exerting healthspanpromoting inhibitory effects onigdb1or, alternatively, acting throughigdb1independent pathways. Conversely,let756/FGF21 appears dispensable for ZAinduced lifespan and healthspan extension. BecauseC.eleganslack an endoskeleton, these findings espouseagxt2/BAIBA andigdb1/FNDC5 as muscleintrinsic, boneindependent mechanisms of bisphosphonate action on improving sarcopenia.\n\nRecent rodent work showed that bisphosphonates attenuate denervation atrophy by downregulating sirtuin3 (SIRT3),19a mitochondrially localized NAD+dependent deacetylase with important roles in regulating skeletal muscle metabolism. We observed that knockingdown aC.elegansmitochondrial sirtuin,sir2.3, improved life and healthspan, whereas mitochondrialsir2.2KD had no effect, as reported by others.33Becausesir2.3KD with combined ZA was neither inhibitory nor synergistically beneficial to lifespan or healthspan, this supports the model of bisphosphonatemediated mitochondrial sirtuin inhibition as a regulator of mammalian muscle health19and now sarcopenia. Loss ofsir2.2was, however, dispensable for the positive effects of ZA. Along with improved mitochondrial structure observed herein, growing evidence thus suggests that bisphosphonates act at least partially through mitochondrial mechanisms to lessen the effects of sarcopenia.\n\nIn conclusion, chronic bisphosphonate administration delays the onset of muscle structural and mitochondrial decline in aC.elegansmodel of sarcopenia, and this translates to improved animal health across the entire life course. The mechanisms regulating the positive ageing/muscle effects of bisphosphonates appear to be conserved across species and include the mevalonateFOXO metabolic axis, mitochondrial sirtuins and musclederived cytokines. Because worms lack an endoskeleton, these mechanisms of bisphosphonates can also be muscleintrinsic. By directly implicating bisphosphonates in attenuating the consequences of sarcopenia, this study adds to a growing body of evidence that bisphosphonates are a clinically safe, immediately exploitable antisarcopenia therapeutic.",
    "conclusion": "Despite lacking an endoskeleton, ZA delays Caenorhabditis elegans sarcopenia, which translates to improved neuromuscular function across the life course. Bisphosphonates might, therefore, be an immediately exploitable antisarcopenia therapy."
