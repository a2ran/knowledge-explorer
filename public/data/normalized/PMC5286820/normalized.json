    "abstract": "Skewing root patterns provide key insights into root growth strategies and mechanisms that produce root architectures. Roots exhibit skewing and waving when grown on a tilted, impenetrable surface. The genetics guiding these morphologies have been examined, revealing that some Arabidopsis ecotypes skew and wave (e.g. WS), while others skew insignificantly but still wave (e.g. Col 0). The underlying molecular mechanisms of skewing and waving remain unclear. In this study, transcriptome data were derived from two Arabidopsis ecotypes, WS and Col 0, under three tilted growth conditions in order to identify candidate genes involved in skewing.\n\nThis work identifies a number of genes that are likely involved in skewing, using growth conditions that differentially affect skewing and waving. Comparing the gene expression profiles of WS and Col 0 in different tilted growth conditions identified 11 candidate genes as potentially involved in the control of skewing. These 11 genes are involved in several different cellular processes, including sugar transport, salt signaling, cell wall organization, and hormone signaling.\n\nThis study identified 11 genes whose change in expression level is associated with root skewing behavior. These genes are involved in signaling and perception, rather than the physical restructuring of root. Future work is needed to elucidate the potential role of these candidate genes during root skewing.\n\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12870 017 0975 9) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\nKeywords:Transcriptomics, Root skewing, Root waving, Morphometrics, Microarray,Arabidopsis thaliana",
    "methods": "Arabidopsis thalianaplants (wild type cultivars Col 0 and WS) were grown on media plates made from 0.5x MS liquid media, autoclaved with 0.5% Phytagel and poured in square gridded plates (Fisherbrand, Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). Seeds were wet sterilized in 1.7mL Eppendorf microfuge tubes (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) using a 5 min 70% ethanol wash, followed by a 5min 50%v/v sodium hypochlorate solution wash (8.3%; Clorox, Oakland, CA), followed by 6 washes with sterile ddH2O. Seeds were planted on plates and moved to 4 degreesC for 2 days, followed by three days of vertical growth (Agp90 degrees) in 19 degreesC +/  2 degreesC, and 24 h fluorescent light at approximately 80umolm 2s 1PAR. Plates were photographed, moved to their respective experimental condition (Agp45 degrees, 90 degrees, or 135 degrees), and photographed again on day 8 after germination (day 5 after gravistimulation). Plants were harvested and fixed in RNAlater (Ambion, Grand Island, New York, USA). Images of 8day old plates were stacked, aligned, and measured using JFilament plugin for ImageJ [106 108]. Root measurements were processed through a custom R script, available on GitHub [109]. Data were analyzed using R and two way ANOVAs with Type II sum of squares [110]. Post hoc analysis was conducted using Scheff's method.\n\nRoots were dissected from shoots and RNA was extracted using Qiagen RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Five roots were used for each chip, and three chips were used per condition. Lateral roots were not quantified, but did not appear to be significantly different between treatments. Initial RNA concentration was determined by Eppendorf BioSpectrometer (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Final RNA concentration was determined on a NanoDrop Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies Inc., Wilmington, DE) and sample quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA). Briefly, 100ng of total RNA from each sample was reverse transcribed into double stranded cDNA, from which biotin labeled cRNA was generated using the 3 IVT plus Kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The cRNA was purified using magnetic beads and was fragmented. Following fragmentation, cRNA products (12.5ug) were hybridized with rotation to the Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Arrays for 16h at 45 degreesC. Arrays were washed on a Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) using the Hybridization Wash and Stain Kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) and the Washing Procedure FS450_0004. Fluorescent signals were measured with an Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G. Initial data analysis was carried out using the MAS5 algorithm within the Affymetrix Expression Console software. Microarray experiments were performed at the Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research Microarray Core, University of Florida. The datasets supporting the conclusions of this article are available in the Gene Expression Omnibus repository [GSE83242].\n\nData were normalized using RMA algorithm using the Limma and Bioconductor packages in R. Differential analyses were processed using R and the Limma package in Bioconductor. Data were imported and organized in Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA). Gene transcripts were significant if absolute value of the fold change was greater than 1 in a base 2 logarithmic scale, as well as a rawp value cutoff ofp<0.05. All genes meeting these criteria were considered, mitigating the risk of false positives with the benefit of identifying as many genes as possible. False discovery rate (FDR) correction was performed for further statistical power, withq<0.05 being indicated in Table1, Additional file1: Table S2 and Additional file2: Table S3. For comparisons between Col 0 and WS cultivars, genes with altered transcripts in all three growth environments were removed if the change was near the same magnitude, within+/ 1 fold change (base 2 log scale). Heatmaps were generated using Gene E (v. 3.0.204, Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA). Gene data was researched using g:Profiler [89,90], agriGO [111], ATTED II [112], Biogrid [113,114], UniProt [115], KEGG [116,117], and STRING [118] online databases. Additional visualization of gene networks was created using GeneMANIA [119].\n\nFor qRT PCR validation of transcriptome microarray data, 460ng of total RNA were reverse transcribed into cDNA using High Capacity RNA to cDNA Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Primers used werePAP24(F: 5'   ACACGATTGGAGAGAAGGCA   3'; R: 5'   AACCAAGGACACGATGAGCT   3'),SEN1(F: 5'   AGGAAATGTTGCAGCAGAGG   3'; R: 5'   CGTTGATGGCTCTAGTCGGA   3'),ASN1(F:   GGAATATTTGGGGACGGTGC   3'; R: 5'   CGGGACATCAAGAACATCGG   3'), andHKT1(F: 5'   TCTTGGAGTGACGGTGCTAG   3'; R: 5'   CAGAGGTCCATTCAAAGGCG   3'). The cDNA was analyzed by qRT PCR using SYBR Green reagents and was normalized toUBQ11prior to the internal vertical control comparison or the Col 0 to WS comparison.",
    "results": "Arabidopsis ecotypes Wassilewskija (WS) and Columbia (Col 0) differ in their skewing and waving behaviors, where WS demonstrates strong skewing and waving while Col 0 waves like WS but does not greatly skew, which was a growth pattern observed in spaceflight and on the ground (selected references: [14,17,49]). These two ecotypes were grown at three growth angles (Agp45 degrees, 135 degrees, or vertical control of Agp90 degrees) to produce different root phenotypes (Figs.1and2). Plants were grown for 3days vertically, then moved to each respective Agpfor 5 more days, resulting in steady state behavior in each of the Agp.\n\nVarious comparisons of microarray data reveals different genes involved in root skewing and waving.Arrows pointto control used in each experiment.Vertical arrowsindicate comparisons within ecotypes, horizontal arrows indicate comparisons between ecotypes.

Plants were grown vertically for 3days on 0.5% Phytagel agar media, moved to their respective growth conditions, and grown for 5 more days. Plants were imaged, harvested, and fixed in RNAlater 8days after germination (5days after gravistimulation). Bars represent means (averagen=43) and error bars represent 95% confidence interval. Measurements were conducted using ImageJ plugin JFilament [106 108] and were processed using custom R scripts available on GitHub [109]. For comparisons where interaction of the two independent variables is significant, results of Scheff's method are represented with letters. Bars with different letters are different from one another (p<0.05). For comparisons where interaction of the two independent variables is not significant, brackets and stars are used in addition to letter codes (p<0.05=*). Brackets indicate grouped measurements; all bars for one unit on the x axis are compared to other bars for other x axis units, and are represented by the significance indicator above the bracket.aLength of primary root. Roots grown at Agp90 degrees were the longest, followed by roots grown at Agp135 degrees, and roots grown at Agp45 degrees were the shortest. Col 0 roots were shorter than WS roots.bHorizontal growth index of primary root. WS roots skewed more than Col 0 roots when grown at Agp45 degrees and 135 degrees.cStraightness of primary root. WS roots were less straight than Col 0 roots.dRoot wave density. Roots grown at Agp45 degrees had the highest WD.eRepresentative image of WS at Agp45 degrees.fRepresentative image of Col 0 at Agp 45 degrees.gRepresentative image of WS at Agp90 degrees.hRepresentative image of Col 0 at Agp90 degrees.iRepresentative image of WS at Agp135 degrees.jRepresentative image of Col 0 at Agp135 degrees. All images (courtesy of author) were taken through media\n\nThe first analysis compared transcriptional differences within a ecotype caused by the environmental condition of Agp, specifically differences between WS roots grown at Agp90 degrees and WS roots grown at Agp45 degrees or 135 degrees, and the differences between Col 0 roots grown at Agp90 degrees and Col 0 roots grown at Agp45 degrees or 135 degrees. Only the Agpinfluenced the differences in gene expression and root morphology. Roots were quantified following parameters identified in previous work [12,58] using protocols outlined in the Materials and Methods section. The arrows in Fig.1represent comparisons analyzed. Figure1also shows a diagram of the root morphology for each genotype under each Agp.\n\nThe second analysis compared transcriptional differences between ecotypes at each Agp(e.g. differences between Col 0 and WS roots grown at Agp45 degrees). In this case, the ecotype influenced gene expression and morphology at the given Agp. The horizontal arrows in Fig.1show these comparisons.\n\nThis matrix of comparisons allows two overlapping approaches to using differential expression to identify genes associated with skewing. WS roots skew significantly more than Col 0 roots at Agp135 degrees and significantly more than WS roots at Agp90 degrees (see Fig.1). At Agp45 degrees WS roots skew more than Col 0 roots, but both WS and Col 0 roots also wave at 45 degrees. Quantification of root morphometrics is found in Fig.2, using horizontal growth index (HGI; trigonometric relationship between the overall angle of growth and length of the root), straightness (STR; straight line length of the root from start point to end point divided by the actual length of the root), and wave density (WD; waves per millimeter along root length). Comparisons involving Agp45 degrees allow the removal of waving as a confounding factor in the gene expression analyses.\n\nThese comparisons are represented by the vertical arrows in the left column of Fig.1, with the numbers indicating the number of significantly altered transcripts from each comparison (significance cutoffs of |log2(fc)|>1;p<0.05). False discovery rate (FDR) corrections are found in Table1.\n\nComparing different growth angles to vertical within Col 0\n\nWhen gene expression profiles of roots grown at Agp45 degrees were compared to Agp90 degrees, 22 genes were shown to be differentially regulated, three of which were upregulated and 19 of which were downregulated (Fig.3a). Col 0 plants grown at Agp45 degrees had roots that waved but did not skew as compared to the roots of plants grown at Agp90 degrees. Thus these 22 differentially expressed genes were associated with a root waving and but not root skewing.\n\nComparison of transcriptomes as they relate to morphology. Heat maps illustrate differences generated by angle of the growth plate (Agp) or genetic differences.aGenes with altered transcription within Col 0 compared to the control of Agp90 degrees. Col 0 had 22 gene transcripts altered at Agp45  degrees and 6 altered at Agp135 degrees. Data in the heat map corresponds with data in Table1.bGenes with altered transcription within WS compared to the control of Agp90 degrees. WS had 66 altered gene transcripts at Agp45 degrees and 40 altered at Agp135 degrees. Data in heat map corresponds with data in Additional file1: Table S2.cTranscript comparisons between Col 0 and WS ecotypes   a genetic comparison   with morphological diagrams corresponding to each of the categories (I VI) of gene expression profile. Transcripts between the ecotypes were removed if they were altered at the same level at all Agp. For example, if the transcript forGene Awas downregulated 2 fold in all conditions, it was removed. This comparison between Col 0 and WS had 128 altered gene transcripts at Agp90 degrees, 88 altered between Col 0 and WS at Agp45 degrees, and 133 altered between Col 0 and WS at Agp135 degrees. Data in heat map corresponds to data in Additional file2: Table S3.\n\nComparison of gene expression profiles of roots grown at Agp135 degrees with profiles of roots grown at Agp90 degrees (Fig.3a), revealed only 6 genes that were differentially regulated between the two growth conditions. All 6 of these genes were downregulated. Morphologically, Col 0 roots grown at Agp135 degrees were not significantly different from those grown at Agp90 degrees (Fig.2). Four genes out of these six were also present among the significantly differentially expressed genes in the Agp45 degrees comparison to Agp90 degrees, with just 2 being unique (At1g09310; a protein of unknown function with DUF538 and At3g19430; a protein related to late embryogenesis abundant proteins, Table1).\n\nThus the 18 genes unique to the Agp45 degrees comparison to their 90 degrees controls may represent genes associated with root waving, but not skewing. Many different processes were associated with these 18 genes identified, such as cell wall structure (XTH7,XTH9) and sugar transport (SWEET11,OCT1; Table1).\n\nOnly four genes had altered transcript levels at both Agp45 degrees and 135 degrees, meaning that they responded to both the backward and forward tilted growth environments (Fig.3a). All four of these genes were downregulated at approximately the same levels in both conditions. These genes wereAt4g12490(a pEARLI1 like LTP),THIOREDOXIN H8(TRX8; At1g69880),DEFECTIVE IN INDUCED RESISTANCE 1(DIR1; At5g48485; putative LTP), andCELL WALL INVERTASE 5(ATCWINV5; At3g13784).\n\nThese comparisons are represented by the vertical arrows in the right column of Fig.1. The number of genes with significantly altered transcripts is located next to the appropriate arrow in Fig.1(significance cutoffs of |log2(fc)|>1;p<0.05). False discovery rate (FDR) corrections are found in Additional file1: Table S2.\n\nAt Agp45 degrees, WS produces roots that both skew and wave compared to the roots grown vertically (Agp90 degrees). Gene expression profiles revealed that WS that were grown at Agp45 degrees had 66 genes with altered transcription in roots compared to Agp90 degrees. Nine of the 66 genes were upregulated, while 57 were downregulated (Fig.3band Additional file1: Table S2). These genes may represent those involved in both skewing and waving processes. Processes associated with these genes include lipid transfer (AZELAIC ACID INDUCED 1[AZI1; At4g12470],CELL WALL PLASMA MEMBRANE LINKER PROTEIN[CWLP; At3g22120]), pectin methylesterase inhibition (At5g62330, At2g01610), and peroxidase activity (PEROXIDASE 49[PER49; At4g36430],PEROXIDASE 53[PER53; At5g06720]; Additional file1: Table S2).\n\nWhen grown at Agp135 degrees WS produces roots that skew without waving (Fig.2). Gene expression profiles revealed that WS roots grown at Agp 135 degrees had 40 genes with altered transcription in roots compared to WS roots grown at Agp90 degrees. These 40 genes are likely skewing related (Fig.3b). Only two genes (HISTONE H1 3[HIS1 3; At2g18050] andDARK INDUCIBLE 2[DIN2; At3g60140]) also had differential transcription in Col 0, and the expression level ofDIN2was in opposite directions (Table1and Additional file1: Table S2). Some of the processes included are methionine metabolism related (METHIONINE GAMMA LYASE[MGL; At1g64660]), histone related (HIS1 3), and jacalin related (JACALIN RELATED LECTIN 40[JAL40; At5g28520]). Other genes from these 40 will be discussed in more detail in the following sections.\n\nThe genes with altered transcription in both Agp45 degrees and at Agp135 degrees (14 out of the 40 genes previously mentioned) were altered in the same way in both Agp45 degrees and 135 degrees compared to Agp90 degrees, except for one gene. This one gene wasASPARAGINE SYNTHETASE [GLUTAMINE HYDROLYZING] 1(ASN1; At3g47340, also calledDIN6,), which was downregulated in Agp45 degrees and upregulated in Agp135 degrees, and is involved in darkness responses and sucrose starvation responses. The remaining 13 genes were involved in various processes, including cell wall reorganization (XYLOGLUCAN ENDOTRANSGLUCOSYLASE/HYDROLASE 9[XTH9; At4g03210]) and sugar transport (SWEET11andSWEET12; At3g48740 and At5g23660, respectively).\n\nThe gene expression profiles between Col 0 and WS when skewing and waving were also compared. These comparisons are represented in Fig.1by the horizontal arrows pointing toward WS, with the number of significantly altered levels of gene transcripts indicated above each arrow. Genes altered between Col 0 and WS at the same level in all three growth angles were removed from the comparison, as they represent inherent differences between the cultivars that were independent of the testing environments. The plant images and morphometrics are found in Fig.2, with resulting heat map with six different patterns of expression pattern categories in Fig.4and gene annotations, information, and significance cutoffs in Additional file2: Table S3.\n\nComparison of candidate skew genes from physiological and genotypic comparisons.aVenn diagram of gene numbers from Fig.3, illustrating overlap of 16 genes. The left circle represents total number of genes changed in WS (Fig.3b) and the right circle represents total number of genes changed between Col 0 and WS in groups IV, V, and VI (Fig.3c).bGenes with altered transcription identified in Fig.3b(left column) were combined with genes with altered transcription identified in groups IV, V, and VI of Fig.3c(right column), resulting in 16 genes. The majority of overlapping gene transcripts occurs with Agp135 degrees   a growth condition that elicited root skewing with minimal waving   totaling 11 highly probable skew gene candidates (HPSGC), shown here in bolded text with dark connecting lines\n\nThe first differential gene expression pattern had altered transcripts between Col 0 and WS only when grown Agp90 degrees. Genes 1 61 had altered transcript levels in Category I (Fig.3c); 19 of the identified genes were upregulated and 42 of which were downregulated (Additional file2: Table S3). This pattern indicated inherent genetic differences between these two lines in their control condition and these differences were mitigated or no longer present in other tested growth environments.\n\nThe second differential gene expression pattern had altered transcripts between Col 0 and WS when cultivars grown Agp90 degrees, but also had altered transcripts in a same way when grown at Agp45 degrees. Genes 62 85 had altered transcript levels in Category II (Fig.3c); 15 of the identified genes were upregulated and 9 downregulated when comparing the gene expression in Col 0 to WS roots (Additional file2: Table S3). This expression pattern was not considered to be involved with skewing, since Agp45 degrees results in a combination of skewing and waving in WS and waving in Col 0. Additionally, the genes identified in this expression pattern were not significantly different in Agp135 degrees, which generates skewing without waving in WS and a non skewing, non waving phenotype in Col 0 (Fig.2).\n\nThe third expression pattern had altered transcript levels between Col 0 and WS when grown Agp90 degrees and at Agp135 degrees. Genes 86 128 had altered transcript levels in Category III (Fig.3c); 20 of the identified genes were upregulated and 23 genes downregulated when comparing Col 0 to WS (Fig.3cand Additional file2: Table S3). At Agp135 degrees WS skewed and Col 0 did not, yet these genes showed same differential expression between Col 0 and WS roots when grown at Agp90 degrees and do not exhibit any skewing or waving differences (Figs.2and3c). These genes were likely not involved with skewing.\n\nThe fourth expression pattern had altered transcript levels between Col 0 and WS only when both were grown at Agp45 degrees. Genes 129 166 had altered transcript levels in Category IV (Fig.3c); 30 of the identified genes were upregulated and 8 were downregulated (Fig.3cand Additional file2: Table S3). The genes identified represent a combination of skewing and waving phenomena, and as such, were considered as potential root skewing candidates.\n\nThe fifth expression pattern had altered transcript levels at both Agp45 degrees and 135 degrees when comparing Col 0 roots to WS roots. Genes 167 192 had altered transcript levels in Category V (Fig.3c); 20 of the identified genes were upregulated and 6 were downregulated (Fig.3c). Skewing occurred in WS but not in Col 0 in both conditions (Fig.2), although at Agp45 degrees, skewing occurred with waving. For WS roots, skewing was a distinguished morphological phenotype from Col 0. The genes identified had altered transcript levels in both Agp45 degrees and 135 degrees, and are therefore likely involved with skewing.\n\nThe sixth and final expression pattern had altered transcript levels at Agp135 degrees only, when comparing Col 0 to WS. Genes 193 256 had altered transcript levels in Category VI (Fig.3c); 14 of the identified genes were upregulated and 50 genes were downregulated, meaning that WS had higher levels of these 50 genes when compared to Col 0. These identified genes were likely involved in skewing since skewing occurs in WS at Agp135 degrees with minimal waving but it does not in Col 0, thus is the only phenotypic difference between the roots of the two ecotypes (Fig.2). The genes from the fifth and the sixth expression patterns, totaling 90 genes, were selected as a root skewing candidate genes.\n\nWhen combining the lists of genes identified in Categories IV, V, and VI (128 genes) with genes identified within WS comparisons (66 genes altered at Agp45 degrees and 40 genes altered at Agp135 degrees), 16 genes are shared (Fig.4). This overlap is illustrated by the Venn diagram in Fig.4a. The majority of shared genes between the two data sets involved Agp135 degrees   the growth condition that elicited skewing with minimal waving   resulting in 11 genes, which were named the highly probable skew gene candidates (HPSGC, Table2; also indicated by \"Y*\" in Additional file1: Table S2). Several of the HPSGC have been verified with qRT PCR, showing similar trends to the transcriptomic microarray data [see Additional file3]. The HPSGC are involved in a variety of cellular processes. Additionally, only 3 of these 11 genes were shared with the set of genes identified in Col 0 grown at Agp45 degrees, which induced root waving (Fig.3a, Table1). Two of these genes (DIN2andASN1) were expressed in opposite directions, while the remaining gene (SWEET11) was upregulated in all sets.\n\nHPSGC and their various functional groups and signaling pathways that could contribute to WS root skewing\n\nHPSGC are reported, with \"X\" indicating to which process or category each member belongs. SUBA3 reports localization of each HPSGC\n\nThe 11 genes comprising the HPSGC, indicated by bolded text in Fig.4b, areMYO INOSITOL OXYGENASE 4(MIOX4; At4g26260; involved in inositol oxygenase activity, syncytium formation, and iron ion binding),PURPLE ACID PHOSPHATASE 24(PAP24; At4g24890; involved in protein serine/threonine phosphatase activity),SWEET11(a sucrose efflux transporter),DIN2(a beta glucosidase mRNA, involved in glycoside hydrolase, and is induced after darkness),ASN1(involved in darkness and sucrose starvation responses),SENESCENCE 1(SEN1; At4g35770; senescence associated, induced by phosphate starvation),HIGH AFFINITY K+ TRANSPORTER 1(HKT1; At4g10310; sodium transporter in xylem parenchyma),SALT INDUCED SERINE RICH(SIS; At5g02020; involved in salt tolerance), At2g25150 (HXXXD transferase family protein involved in transferring acyl groups other than amino acyl groups), At5g66780 (unknown gene), and At3g28310 (unknown gene containing DUF677).",
    "discussion": "The primary set of 92 candidate genes involved in skewing was identified by comparing the transcription of WS genes when grown at Agp45 degrees or 135 degrees compared to Agp90 degrees. Morphologically, WS roots skew when grown at Agp135 degrees with reduced waving (Figs.1and2). The genes with altered transcription identified in this comparison of Agp135 degrees to Agp90 degrees represent the pool of genes likely involved in root skewing and not waving, since they were altered in a condition that induces root skewing independent of the classical root waving patterns. WS roots also skew when grown at Agp45 degrees; however, the occurrence of waving at Agp45 degrees complicates the relationship between skewing and transcriptome at Agp45 degrees. It is important to note that only roots were used for the microarrays, and that lateral roots appeared to be similar across all treatments. As seen in Table2, the 11 genes associated with skewing cluster into a few biological categories, suggesting that several pathways interact to produce skewed growth and directionality.\n\nCol 0 roots, on the other hand, did not skew as did WS roots, and as such, differed only in waving when Agp45 degrees or 135 degrees were compared to Agp90 degrees. The number of genes with altered transcription at Agp45 degrees or 135 degrees compared to Agp90 degrees was also reduced, and not considered in the list of candidate skew genes due to the lack of skewing morphology.\n\nComparing gene expression patterns between WS and Col 0 shows how the ecotypes cope with the same environmental challenges presented to them, in this case whether the angle of the growth plate produces skewed roots. In order to determine which gene expression patterns are related to skewing, the relative expression patterns can be correlated to the morphology generated in each of the growth angles.\n\nCategories I III in Fig.3care not related to skewing. The first category (Category I, Genes 1 61; Fig.3cand Additional file2: Table S3) contains genes that were different between WS and Col 0 at Agp90 degrees and also unchanged at Agp45 degrees or 135 degrees (Additional file2: Table S3). The second category (Category II, Genes 62 85; Fig.3cand Additional file2: Table S3) contained genes that were differentially expressed between WS and Col 0 at Agp45 degrees. However, the transcript expression of these genes was also different when the roots did not skew at Agp90, which suggests that these genes are responding to growth angle but are not responsible for causing the morphologic change. The same logic can be applied to the genes of Category III, where transcript expression was different between WS and Col 0 when grown at Agp90 degrees and when grown at Agp135 degrees (Category III, Genes 86 128; Fig.3cand Additional file2: Table S3).\n\nThe genes of Category IV present a pattern of expression that indicated a potential role in skewing (Category IV; Genes 129 166; Fig.3cand Additional file2: Table S3), since the genes present in this category are differentially expressed between WS (which skews at Agp45 degrees) and Col 0 (which does not skew). Some of the genes identified in this category includeHIS1 3,SKU5 SIMILAR 15(SKS15; At4g37160; involved in oxidoreductase activity and copper ion binding), andXYLOGLUCAN ENDOTRANSGLUCOSYLASE/HYDROLASE 26(XTH26; At4g28850; involved in hydrolase activity and cell wall remodeling).SKS15is related to a known SKU gene (SKU5), which is also known to have substantial impact on root growth and morphology [56]. Protein products ofXTH26reduce cell wall elongation in roots with altered root hair morphology [59], which may also impact the overall directionality or skewing of the root.\n\nThe second category of genes whose differential expression between WS and Col 0 indicated a role in skewing (Category V; Genes 167 192; Fig.3cand Additional file2: Table S3) contains genes that were differentially expressed between the ecotypes at both Agp45 degrees and 135. The transcription of these genes was altered in the same way at both growth angles, and since skewing occurred at both growth angles (Fig.2), it can be assumed that these genes very likely play some role in the skewing morphology (Additional file2: Table S3). A couple of the genes identified includeMODIFIER OF SNC1 2(MOS2; At1g33520; whereSNC1isSUPPRESSOR OF NPR1 1, CONSTITUTIVEandNPR1 1isNONEXPRESSER OF PATHOGENESIS RELATED 1; At4g16890 and At1g64280, respectively) andBEL1 LIKE HOMEODOMAIN 10 (BEL10; At1g19700, whereBEL1is a homeodomain transcription factor controlling ovule patterning; At5g41410).MOS2is a DNA binding gene that plays a role in the immune response pathway and in microRNA (miRNA) maturation [60]. miRNAs are heavily involved in gene regulation [61]. Since Col 0 roots have higher transcript levels ofMOS2at both Agp45 degrees and 135 degrees than WS, it is possible that miRNAs are involved early in the signaling pathway leading toward root growth parallel with gravity. The lower levels ofMOS2in WS roots could be limiting the rate of signal transduction, changing the entire pathway, and ultimately changing root directionality and introducing root skewing.BEL10was upregulated in Col 0 roots compared to WS roots grown at Agp45 degrees or 135 degrees (Additional file2: Table S3).BEL10is a transcription factor that interacts with PLP, a blue light receptor also involved in response to salt or dehydration stresses [62]. Higher or lower intracellular levels of phosphate could alter the ability of this gene to interact downstream in phosphate signaling pathways [36]. Additionally, inorganic phosphate depravation can influence seemingly redundant signal peptides to subsequently alter root growth [63], which may, in turn, alter overall root directionality and impact skewing.\n\nThe third category of genes that indicated a role in skewing (Category VI; Genes 193 256; Fig.3cand Additional file2: Table S3) contains genes that were differentially expressed between Col 0 and WS when roots were grown at Agp135 degrees. Since WS roots skewed at this growth angle and did not wave differently from roots grown at Agp90 degrees, the genes identified in this category were considered likely to be associated with skewing. Some of the genes in this category includeRESPONSIVE TO ABA 18(RAB18; At5g66400) andPINOID BINDING PROTEIN 1(PBP1; At5g54490; Additional file2: Table S3).RAB18was downregulated in Col 0 roots compared to WS roots at Agp135 degrees. This dehydrin related protein is reduced after exogenous 1 Aminocyclopropane 1 carboxylic acid (ACC) application, meaning it responds directly to ethylene in addition to abscisic acid (ABA) [64].PBP1was downregulated in Col 0 roots compared to WS roots at Agp135 degrees. Since this PINOID binding protein is upregulated by auxin [65], the differentPBP1levels between Col 0 and WS could indicate different auxin levels between the two ecotypes [65,66]. Additional genes identified in Category VI will be discussed in the following section, due to their overlap with previously identified skew gene candidates.\n\nA subset of most likely candidate genes was identified by the intersection of the list based on growth angle in WS and the list based on comparative gene expression between WS and Col 0 (Fig.4), with the overlap of the two lists indicated in the Venn diagram, found in Fig.4a. The list of 92 genes based on growth angle of WS (Fig.4b; left heat map labeled \"Physiology\") was compared to the list of 128 genes identified between Col 0 and WS (Fig.4b; right heat map labeled \"Genotype\"), producing 16 genes that appear in both lists (Fig.4a and b; Y* in both Additional file1: Table S2 and Additional file2: Table S3). The majority of these 16 genes are found involving Agp135 degrees, shown in bold text and dark lines. Agp135 degrees was the growth condition that elicited root skewing with minimal waving in WS, so to have the majority of overlapping genes identified by both the physiological and genotypic comparisons represented in this Agpprovides more support for their involvement in root skewing. These 11 genes are noted as the highly probable skew gene candidates (HPSGC).\n\nThe 11 HPSGC are involved in many different processes and were subjected to a thorough literature and expression map search using many available databases, such as Suba3, TAIR, and the Arabidopsis eFP browser [67 71]. These genes were searched with the goal of finding associations with cell expansion, division, auxin transport, or any process involved with root tropisms, so as to develop insights into their roles in skewing. Sub organ localizations (e.g. columella cells, root tip, root hairs, etc.) were noted where possible. A summary of these results is found in Table2.\n\nMIOX4is expressed in root hairs, stele, and lateral root cap [71], and digested columella cells have lower transcript abundance in response to auxin [70]. Additionally, overexpression ofMIOX4in the presence ofl Ascorbic acid have increased root growth [72].MIOX4influences root growth responses during stressed conditions [73], but knockouts do not have abnormal cell walls, despite the role ofMIOX4upstream of polysaccharide integration into the cell wall [74].\n\nPAP24is not highly expressed in any root zones [69 71], but is predicted to be in plant cell walls and to have acid phosphatase and metal ion binding activity [67].\n\nASN1is expressed in root hairs [71] and in the root under phosphate starvation [75].ASN1is also responsive to darkness and sucrose starvation, and may have a role in response to viral infections [76].\n\nAt2g25150is highly expressed in the cortex under normal conditions [71], but is not shown to be auxin responsive [70]. In the literature, At2g25150 is described to have a product that is a BAHD enzyme with spermidine coumaroyl CoA acyltransferase activity in roots [77] and is upregulated by cytokinin activity [78], which is evidence for its activity in cell division [77].\n\nSISis not significantly expressed in roots under normal conditions, but is upregulated in the columella cells, root cap, and epidermis of Arabidopsis roots after 1h of salt stress [79] and 1hour at low pH [80].SISis also known to be involved in salt tolerance [67].\n\nAt5g66780is not expressed in the root under normal conditions, but is upregulated in the root tip at low pH levels and under salt stress [74,80]. Under normal conditions,At5g66780is expressed in all zones along the root epidermis, though not contiguously [71]. This gene is unknown; no other published information exists on this gene.\n\nAt3g28310is expressed in the procambium of the root in the elongation zone [69,71]. This gene produces a hypothetical protein with DUF677 [67] and is not well studied.\n\nDIN2is not expressed in the root under normal condtions, but is upregulated in roots under salt stress [79] and in conditions lacking inorganic phosphate [75].DIN2mRNA can be transported from cell to cell [81], and is involved in a process that can lead to weakened root cell walls when under salt stress [82].\n\nSEN1is expressed in mature and developing root hairs [71], and is downregulated in the presence of auxin [70].SEN1is regulated by both methyl jasmonate and salicylic acid [83], and strongly induced by phosphate starvation [84],. Knockout mutants are growth deficient in the light [67].\n\nSWEET11is present in the vasculature in the zone of maturation [71], and is downregulated in the cortex of sulfur deficient roots after 24h [80].SWEET11is a known sucrose efflux transporter that can assist with carbon transport to the roots in times of water stress [85].\n\nHKT1is expressed in the proto and metaphloem of the zone of maturation in Arabidopsis roots [69,71], and is linked to salt and water stress responses [86]. Knockouthkt1has significantly lower root sugars and higher tricarboxylic acid following salt stress, indicating a role for sugar metabolism in salt stress [86]. HKT1 is also regulated by cytokinin [87], and has a close interaction with ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE 4 (ABI4; At2g40220), where both gene products are expressed in the same cells andABI4binds to sites in the HKT1 promoter [88].\n\nThe 11 HPSGC show similar expression patterns in that none are particularly expressed in the root tip versus the rest of the root and are all closely related into one co expression and co localization network (Fig.5), despite being members of disparate signaling pathways and potential activities (Table2). These different signaling and environmental sensing pathways, such as salt, sugar, and darkness responses, are linked by their individual gene members. For example,ASN1,SWEET11, andHKT1are involved in sucrose response, sugar transport, and salt signaling, respectively. These three genes, which are not co expressed or co localized with one another, are all co expressed with a common gene (SWEET12; Fig.5), which further complicates the roles of each gene involved. Other HPSGC are involved with more downstream processes. DIN2 and SIS are involved in two different environmental sensing and cell signaling processes, are co localized with one another, and are both co localized with ACTIN DEPOLYMERIZING FACTOR 9 (ADF9; At4g34970) and PLANT INVERTASE/PECTIN METHYLESTERASE 47 (PME47; At5g04970; Fig.5), both of which are involved in cell wall remodeling. Other genes pulled in by this co expression and co localization network are related to handling sugar signaling downstream of sensing, such asSUGAR TRANSPORTER 1(STP1; At1g11260) andLIKE SEX4 1(LSF1; At3g01510, whereSEX4is a plant specific glucan phosphatase; Fig.5). An additional network file shows the relationship between HPSGC and these additional genes [see Additional file4]. This computational approach to the HPSGC illustrates possibilities for how these environmental sensing and signaling pathway genes could be involved in the generation of root skewing.\n\nCo expression and co localization network of HPSGC shows each member is linked with others. Additionally, other genes pulled into the network are other members of the same signaling networks or downstream cell wall remodeling. Network generated with GeneMANIA [119]\n\nSugar signaling is a major signaling pathway identified in the skew gene candidates. Sucrose efflux transportersSWEET11andSWEET12were both upregulated in WS roots grown at Agp45 degrees and 135 degrees.SWEET11, a member of the HPSGC, was also upregulated in Col 0 roots grown at Agp45 degrees (Table1and Additional file1: Table S2). These genes are also associated with response to salt stress, divalent metal ion transport, and are integral in the endomembrane system [89,90]. SWEET11 and SWEET12 are shown to assist in phloem unloading into the apoplast [91], with SWEET12 responding to CO2as well [92]. This sugar transport could be used for signaling, as other members of theMtN3/saliva/SWEET family of genes are involved with ion transport and physiological process regulation [93]. Root exudates are also involved in regulation of the surrounding microbiome and microenvironment [94], and these SWEET efflux proteins may be involved in shaping root growth and directionality through signaling. Additionally,ASN1was upregulated in WS roots grown at Agp135 degrees and was downregulated in both Col 0 and WS roots grown at Agp45 degrees (Table1and Additional file1: Table S2). ASN1 responds to sucrose starvation, and mRNA accumulation is suppressed with sugar in some tests [95,96]. Additionally, both of these genes are responsive to absence of light, and may be involved in light/sugar signaling pathways (Additional file1: Table S2). It is possible that ASN1 would be involved with the aforementionedSWEETfamily network. BothDIN2andASN1were upregulated in the presence of various heavy metals, further implicating their roles in environmental signaling pathways [97], with ASN1 being expressed in the elongation and maturation zones in the root [71].\n\nOther genes in the HPSGC are involved in sugar signaling and subsequent related phosphatase pathways.DIN2is a dark inducible responsive to sugar starvation [96,98].DIN2transcript is increased in the absence of type 1 and 2A protein phosphatases [96]. Though technically a metallo phosphoesterase and a type 5 acid phosphatase,PAP24is a member of the HPSGC and may be involved in similar signaling pathways [99].MIOX4is suppressed in the shoot by exogenous application of glucose, which my influence root expression through InsP3signaling cascades [73], which itself plays a role in response to gravitropic stimuli [100].SEN1is another gene induced in roots by phosphate starvation and induced in leaves by a glucose transport inhibitor [101].SEN1itself may provide a link between glucose signaling and phosphate signaling [101], and is highly expressed in the meristematic zone of the root [71].\n\nSalt signaling is another functional group identified in the HPSGC.HKT1has a role in salt signaling in Arabidopsis roots [102], and is likely involved in loading sodium ions into phloem to transport to roots, indirectly regulating potassium ion concentrations [86].HKT1activity is reduced by high calcium levels [103,104], which could point to a crosstalk linkage point between calcium and salt signaling pathways.SISalso has a role in salt tolerance, but is mostly unknown at this time [105]. Some of these salt related genes are present in root regions that would imply signaling activity and growth determination. For example,DIN2is present in the columella cells and stele of roots under salt stress, whileSISis present in the epidermis, lateral root cap, cortex, and partially present in the endodermis [79].",
    "conclusion": "This work investigated the transcriptional differences between skewing and non skewing roots. Comparisons within WS revealed genes that responded to the angle of growth (Agp) during the process of skewing. These genes were cross referenced with transcripts differing between the WS and Col 0 genotypes to refine the list of genes that are most probably be involved in root skewing. A majority of the highly probable skew gene candidates (HPSGC) are directly associated with environmental sensing (e.g. salt, sugar, hormones, darkness), upstream of physical growth differences (e.g. cell wall remodeling, cell division, cell elongation). Thus, pathways that respond to disparate signals from the root local environment may drive the root behavior of skewing. However, it is also possible that some of the HPSGC are responses to the altered phenotype, rather than the basis of the phenotype. In order to separate these two hypotheses, future studies could investigate the HPSGC to find the specific pathways and molecular mechanisms contributing to root skewing."
