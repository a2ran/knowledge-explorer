    "abstract": "Ribosomally synthesized and post translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) are an important class of natural products that contain antibiotics and a variety of other bioactive compounds. The existing methods for discovery of RiPPs by combining genome mining and computational mass spectrometry are limited to discovering specific classes of RiPPs from small datasets, and they fail to handle unknown post translational modifications. We present MetaMiner, a software tool for addressing these challenges that is compatible with large scale screening platforms for natural product discovery. After searching millions of spectra in the Global Natural Products Social (GNPS) molecular networking infrastructure against just eight genomic and metagenomic datasets, MetaMiner discovered 31 known and seven unknown RiPPs from diverse microbial communities including human microbiome, lichen microbiome, and micro organisms isolated from the International Space Station.\n\nKeywords:Ribosomally synthesized and post translationally modified peptides, computational mass spectrometry, metagenomics, natural products discovery, microbial metabolites",
    "methods": "Further information and requests for resources should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the Lead Contact, Hosein Mohimani (hoseinm@andrew.cmu.edu). This study did not generate new unique reagents.\n\nWe analyzed the following paired datasets of spectra and genome/metagenome data (all datasets, with the exception of the BACIL dataset, contain high resolution spectra):\n\nThis small dataset consists of 18 spectra of known RiPPs that were used for benchmarking MetaMiner (GNPS datasets MSV000079506 and MSV000079622). Spectra were collected from purified RiPPs fromProchlorococcus marinusMIT 9313 (four analogs of prochlorosins),Geobacillus thermodenitrificansNG80 (geobacillin),Bacillus subtilisNCIB 3610 (sublancin),Bacillus haloduransC 125 (haloduracin),Lactococcus lactis(lacticin),Bacillus cereusSJ1 (two analogs of bicereusins) andRuminococcus flavefaciensFD 1 (eight analogs of flavecins). For these strains, we used genome sequence information available from the NCBI RefSeq database. AntiSMASH identified 70 biosynthetic gene clusters in these genomes, including 29 RiPP encoding clusters. Since the genome sequence of the lacticin producer is not available, we searched its spectrum against its described biosynthetic gene clusters (Rince et al., 1997).\n\nThis dataset consists of 473,135 spectra from bacterial extracts of 36Actinomycetalesstrains with sequenced genomes (Duncan et al., 2015;Mohimani et al., 2014b) (GNPS datasets MSV000078839 and MSV000078604). We downloaded sequence information for these 36 genomes from the NCBI RefSeq database. AntiSMASH identified 1,140 biosynthetic gene clusters in these genomes, including 168 RiPP encoding clusters. Furthermore, we downloaded and mixed the short reads from 21 out of 36 strains that were available from the NCBI Short Reads Archive (read length 150 bp, insert sizes varying between 200 bp to 300 bp). We randomly down sampled each dataset to 10 million reads (resulting in an approximate 300 fold coverage), and mixed all the reads to simulate a metagenomic dataset for this sample. Running MetaMiner on the separate genomes from this dataset resulted in the same set of identified RiPPs as obtained from the simulated metagenome.\n\nThis dataset consists of 40,051 low resolution spectra from bacterial extracts of twoBacillusstrains with known genomes (Nguyen et al., 2013) (MSV000078552). We downloaded genome sequence information for these isolates from the NCBI RefSeq dataset. AntiSMASH identified 12 biosynthetic gene clusters (one RiPP encoding cluster) inB. amyloliquefaciensFZB42 and 11 biosynthetic gene clusters (four RiPP encoding clusters) inB. licheniformisES 221.\n\nThis dataset consists of 58,422 spectra from bacterial extracts of 21 isolated strains collected at the International Space Station (MSV000080102). Among these strains, twelve areStaphylococcus, sixBacillus, fourEnterobacteriaand oneAcinetobacterstrain. The complete genomes are available for all of these strains (Singh et al., 2016;Venkateswaran et al., 2017). AntiSMASH identified 119 biosynthetic gene clusters, including 27 RiPP encoding clusters.\n\nThis dataset contains 223,135 spectra from bacterial extracts ofTheonella swinhoei(GNPS dataset MSV000078670). Wilson et al. (Wilson et al., 2014) used the SPONGE dataset to analyze the RiPP polytheonamide. We searched spectra from the SPONGE dataset against the genome ofTheonella swinhoeisymbiontCandidatus Entotheonellasp. TSY1. In this dataset, AntiSMASH identified 27 biosynthetic gene clusters, including four RiPP encoding clusters.\n\nThis dataset consists of 11,921,457 spectra from the extracts of 317 cyanobacterial samples (Luzzatto Knaan et al., 2017) (GNPS dataset MSV000078568). Each sample represents a mini metagenome (Nurk et al., 2013;Nurk et al., 2017) with one or a few highly abundant strains. The metagenomic reads were collected from 195 of these samples. AntiSMASH identified 2,898 biosynthetic gene clusters in the 195 cyanobacterial metagenomes, including 491 RiPP encoding clusters.\n\nThis dataset contains 137,556 spectra from 17 human microbiome isolates (GNPS dataset MSV000078556). AntiSMASH identified 55 biosynthetic gene clusters in the 17 human microbiome isolate references, including 12 RiPP encoding clusters.\n\n(HUMAN CF). This dataset contains 7,554,646 spectra from 276 microbial isolates from the sputum culture of cystic fibrosis patients, (GNPS dataset MSV000080251). The short reads were collected on these 276 samples, and each sample contains a mixture of few (from one to eleven) bacteria. AntiSMASH identified 1,111 biosynthetic gene clusters, including 171 RiPP encoding clusters.\n\nMetaMiner works with paired genomic/metagenomic and tandem mass spectral data collected on isolated microbes or bacterial/fungal communities. The genomic input to MetaMiner could be short read data, genome assemblies or extracted biosynthetic gene clusters, in fastq or fasta format. The mass spectral input to MetaMiner is in MGF or mzXML format. If the input is short read data, MetaMiner first assembles the reads into contigs. The pipeline for MetaMiner is described below:\n\n(a) Constructing the database of putative RiPP precursor peptides. MetaMiner uses two strategies to search for precursor peptides, motif ORF and all ORF strategy. The motif ORF strategy is based on the annotations from antiSMASH (Medema et al., 2011;Weber et al., 2015), and BOA (Morton et al., 2015). In this mode, MetaMiner first extracts genes related to secondary metabolites and their neighboring fragments from antiSMASH and BOA annotations. Then, putative peptides are constructed based on the ORFs within these clusters that are sequentially similar to known RiPPs. This strategy usually identifies a small number of putative precursor peptides per biosynthetic gene cluster, resulting in a fast and specific peptidogenomics approach. This strategy is not sensitive, as the peptides that do not have sequence similarity to the known RiPPs are missed.\n\nIn all ORF mode, MetaMiner (i) translates DNA sequence into protein sequence using 6 frame translation, (ii) runs HMMer (Eddy, 2011) on the resulting sequences to detect all the modification enzymes, (iii) constructs a 10kbp window centered at each modification enzyme (this window is called the putative biosynthetic gene cluster), (iv) identifies all the ORFs shorter than a pre defined threshold (default is 200 amino acids) in each putative biosynthetic gene cluster. This approach is capable of discovering RiPPs that do not have any sequence similarity to the known RiPPs.\n\n(b) Constructing target and decoy databases of post translantionally modified RiPPs. To construct the target RiPP structure database, MetaMiner first searches the biosynthetic gene clusters for all the modification enzymes previously reported in RiPPs (Arnison et al., 2013) using HMMer. If a specific modification enzyme is found in a biosynthetic gene cluster, MetaMiner considers the corresponding modification for the identified precursor peptide/peptides.Table S3lists the modifications currently considered by MetaMiner, along with the corresponding amino acid residues and mass shifts.\n\nTo construct the database of decoy RiPPs, MetaMiner (i) creates a decoy database of RiPP precursor peptides by randomly shuffling each peptide in the target precursor database (Elias and Gygi, 2007), and (ii) creates decoy RiPPs from decoy precursors in the same way as the target RiPPs.\n\n(c) Matching spectra against the target and decoy RiPPs. MetaMiner uses a modified version of Dereplicator (Mohimani et al., 2017) for searching spectra against the database of putative target/decoy RiPPs as follows (i) theoretical spectra for all the target/decoy RiPPs are constructed, (ii) peptide spectrum matches are generated and scored, (iii) p values of the peptide spectrum matches are computed using MS DPR (Mohimani et al., 2013), (iv) false discovery rates are computed using the decoy database, and (v) statistically significant peptide spectrum matches are output as putative RiPP identifications.\n\nWhile exhaustive generation of the candidate RiPPs and scoring by Dereplicator is feasible when a small number of modifications are considered, the running time rapidly increases with the increase in the number of modifications. We use the spectral alignment technique to efficiently find modifications of the core peptide that best matches the spectrum (Mohimani et al., 2014a; Pevzner et al., 2000; Pevzner et al., 2001; Tsur et al., 2005). This dynamic programming approach restricts the number of modifications and penalizes high score matches with more than one modification.\n\nWhile the dynamic programming approach from RiPPquest (Mohimani et al., 2014a) can handle modifications in linear peptides, it is not applicable to cyclic peptides. MetaMiner uses a brute force approach to search all the RiPP modifications of each candidate cyclic peptide against all the spectra. To make this possible, MetaMiner uses a faster scoring strategy that utilized the sparsity of mass spectra and theoretical spectra. We do not currently perform blind modification searches for cyclic peptides due to the inherent computational complexity.\n\n(d) Enlarging the set of identified RiPPs via spectral networking. The set of RiPP identifications is enlarged via spectral networks (Bandeira et al., 2007;Watrous et al., 2012).\n\nWhile constructing target and decoy databases of post translationally modified RiPPs (Figure 1b), MetaMiner considers various types of modifications based on the class of the RiPPs.Table S3lists the modifications considered by MetaMiner.\n\nBelow we describe the process of growth (for isolated samples), extraction, and analysis of each dataset by mass spectrometry.\n\nA total of 39 strains ofStreptomyceswere grown on A1, MS and R5 agar, extracted sequentially with ethyl acetate, butanol and methanol, and analyzed on Agilent 6530 Accurate Mass Q TOF spectrometer coupled to an Agilent 1260 LC system.\n\nBacillusstrains were grown on ISP2 agar, extracted with a solvent mixture of 65:35 acetonitrile:water with 0.05% formic acid, and analyzed on a NanoDESI LTQ FT (Thermo Electron) mass spectrometer.\n\nSamples from International Space Station were extracted using 50% MeOH and analyzed on a maXis Impact mass spectrometer coupled to C18 RP UHPLC.\n\nA total of 317 cyanobacterial collections were extracted repetitively with CH2Cl2:MeOH 2:1, dried in vacuo, and fractionated into nine fractions (A I) by silica gel vacuum liquid chromatography (VLC) using a stepwise gradient of hexanes/EtOAc and EtOAc/MeOH, and analyzed on a Maxis Impact mass spectrometer coupled to C18 RP UHPLC.\n\nCultures of reference human microbiome isolates were extracted using 50% EtOH and analyzed on a maXis Impact mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics) coupled to a UltiMate 3000 UPLC system (Thermo Scientific) as described here (Bouslimani et al. 2015).\n\nMicrobial isolates from the sputum culture of cystic fibrosis patients were extracted using 50% MeOH and analyzed on a maXis qTof mass spectrometer coupled to UltiMate 3000 Dionex UPLC system.\n\nHESIRMS data was collected using an Agilent 6230 Accurate Mass TOFMS in positive ion mode by the UCSD Chemistry and Biochemistry Mass Spectrometry Facility. UV Vis data were recorded on a Beckman Coulter DU 800 spectrophotometer at room temperature in MeOH (maxat 214 nm and 217 nm). The ECCD spectrum was measured in MeOH using an Aviv 215 CD spectrometer. Optical rotation was measured at 25  degreesC using a JASCO P 2000 polarimeter ([alpha]25 3.9 (c0.022, MeOH) (lit. (Nogle et al., 2003), [alpha]21D  46.8 (c0.41, MeOH)). A Bruker AVANCE III 600 MHz NMR with a 1.7 mm dual tune TCI cryoprobe was used to record1H, HMBC and HSQC NMR data at 298  degreesK with standard Bruker pulse sequences. A Varian Vx 500 NMR with a cold probe and z gradients was used to record1H NMR data at 298 K with standard pulse sequences. NMR data were recorded in CDCl3and calibrated using residual solvent peaks (H7.26 andC77.16).\n\nFor LC MS analysis, a Thermo Finnigan Surveyor HPLC System was used with a Phenomenex Kinetex 5 um C18 100 x 4.6 mm column coupled to a Thermo Finnigan LCQ Advantage Max Mass Spectrometer. Samples were separated using a linear gradient with (A) H2O + 0.1% FA to (B) CH3CN + 0.1% FA at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min. The gradient started with a 5 min isocratic step at 30% B followed by an increase to 99% B over 17 min, which was held at 99% B for 5 min and then moved to 30% B in 1 min, and then held for 4 min. Mass spectra were acquired with an ESI source ranging fromm/z200 1600.\n\nPreparative HPLC was done using a Kinetex 5 um C18 150 x 10.0 mm semi preparative column coupled to a Thermo Dionex Ultimate 3000 pump, RS autosampler, RS diode array detector, and automated fraction collector.\n\nThe fraction in which MetaMiner identified wewakazole from sample PNG26APR06 4. This fraction (26.5 mg) was initially separated using a 500 mg/8mL Xpertek C18SPE cartridge with 100% CH3CN to yield 10.7 mg after concentration under vacuum. The compound was isolated from this eluent by semi preparative HPLC using a linear gradient with (A) H2O + 0.1% FA to (B) CH3CN at a flow rate of 4 mL/min, and the chromatogram was monitored at 218 nm. The gradient started with a 5 min isocratic step at 40% B followed by an increase to 95% B in 25 min. Approximately 2.5 mg of the sample were injected per run to yield 31.2 mg of wewakazole (tR=13.0 min).\n\nMetaMiner takes paired genomic and metabolomics data as input. For genomic data, MetaMiner accepts raw nucleotide sequences (.fasta file), antiSMASH output (.final.gbk file) or BOA output (.fasta file). For users who have raw DNA short reads data (.fastq file), we provide a brief guidance about how to assemble the short read by SPAdes/metaSPAdes in the MetaMiner manual. For metabolomics data, MetaMiner accepts MGF or mzXML files. MetaMiner output is the report of the detected RiPPs in the plain text tab separated files (.tsv). The spectral network step can be done either through the MetaMiner pipeline, or the GNPS infrastructure (https://ccms ucsd.github.io/GNPSDocumentation/). For more details, please refer to the MetaMiner manual athttps://github.com/mohimanilab/MetaMiner.\n\nFor each dataset, we use 1% false discovery rate (FDR) threshold for RiPP identification. The FDR is estimated with a target decoy approach. For each target RiPP, we create a corresponding decoy RiPP by first randomly shuffling its precursor peptide sequence and then applying all the modifications of the target RiPP to the shuffled precursor peptide. Given a p value threshold, denote the number of peptide spectrum matches in the decoy database and target database asNdecoyandNtarget. The FDR can be estimated as follows:\n\nMetaMiner is available as a command line tool athttps://github.com/mohimanilab/MetaMiner.",
    "results": "MetaMiner pipeline (Figure 1) analyzes the paired genome/metagenome assemblies and tandem mass spectra from isolated microbes or bacterial/fungal communities. Starting from the genome assemblies, MetaMiner (a) identifies putative biosynthetic gene clusters and the corresponding precursor peptides, (b) constructs target and decoy putative RiPP structure databases (c) matches tandem mass spectra against the constructed RiPP structure databases using Dereplicator, and (d) enlarges the set of described RiPPs via spectral networking (Bandeira et al., 2007;Watrous et al., 2012).\n\nMetaMiner pipeline analyzes the paired genome/metagenome assemblies and tandem mass spectra from isolated microbes or bacterial/fungal communities. Starting from the genome assemblies, MetaMiner (a) identifies putative Biosynthetic gene cluster and the corresponding precursor peptides, (b) constructs target and decoy putative RiPP structure databases (c) matches tandem mass spectra against the constructed post translationally modified RiPP structures database using Dereplicator, and (d) enlarges the set of described RiPPs via spectral networking (Bandeira et al., 2007;Watrous et al., 2012). In addition to DNA assemblies, MetaMiner software can also accept various types of input data, including shotgun reads data, antiSMASH output and BOA output.\n\nIn step (a), MetaMiner searches for diverse classes of RiPPs, including lanthipeptides, lassopeptides, linear azole containing peptides (LAPs), linaridins, glycocins, cyanobactins, phenol soluble modulins, AIP, and proteusins (versus only lanthipeptides by RiPPquest). Moreover, MetaMiner supports searching for user defined classes of RiPPs. In step (b) (c), MetaMiner implement an approach to estimate false discovery rate through target decoy analysis by searching mass spectra against decoy RiPP structures generated by random shuffling. In step (c), MetaMiner uses an efficient algorithm for searching sparse vectors corresponding to mass spectra and RiPP structures, increasing the speed by two orders of magnitude compared to RiPPquest, thus enabling searches of the entire GNPS databases against metagenomes. Unusual modifications are handled through blind post translational modification searching. In addition, in contrast to RiPPquest (which was designed for analyzing low resolution spectra), MetaMiner enables searching high resolution mass spectra, and allows user adjustable precursor and product ion thresholds.\n\nMetaMiner uses antiSMASH, and BOA for the identification of RiPP encoding biosynthetic gene clusters and has two genome mining modes for selecting Open Reading Frames (ORFs), a slow all ORF mode introduced in RiPPquest (Mohimani et al., 2014a), and a fast motif ORF mode. The all ORF approach analyzes all short ORFs within a biosynthetic gene cluster, while the motif ORF approach relies on RiPP motif finding (Blin et al., 2014) to narrow the set of putative RiPP encoding ORFs.\n\nWe illustrate positive and negative features of these approaches through genome mining of theStreptomyces roseosporousNRRL 11379 genome obtained from the ACTI dataset (seeSTAR methodsfor details of all the datasets). AntiSMASH found 30 biosynthetic gene clusters in this genome, including six RiPP encoding biosynthetic gene clusters. Within these six biosynthetic gene clusters, the motif ORF approach identified only two short ORFs matching core RiPP motifs, while the all ORF approach identified 14,694 short ORFs.\n\nWhen analyzing all the 36 strains from the ACTI strains, antiSMASH discovered 1,140 biosynthetic gene clusters, including 168 RiPP encoding biosynthetic gene clusters. MetaMiner in the motif ORF and all ORF modes identified 67 and 565,138 short ORFs, respectively. This example illustrates that the motif ORF mode may result in a four order of magnitude reduction in the number of ORF candidates as compared to the all ORF mode. However, antiSMASH predictions are based on searching for a set of known motifs, therefore the motif ORF mode misses some ORFs with novel RiPP motifs. BOA is based on identifying known proximal genes (\"context genes\") that reside next to a RiPP, rather than by the RiPP sequence itself. Therefore, BOA has a capability to identify non orthologous RiPP replacements if those RiPPs maintain homologous context genes. However, if the RiPPs do not have context genes, BOA may not detect those RiPPs. Also, since BOA is trained on bacteriocin context genes only, it is most suited for that type of RiPPs.\n\nAlthough the all ORF mode searches a larger set of ORFs than the motif ORF mode, it does not necessarily result in an increased number of identified RiPPs after matching ORFs against the spectral dataset. Indeed, the peptide spectrum matches that are statistically significant in the motif ORF mode may become statistically insignificant in the all ORF mode because the search space in the all ORF mode is orders of magnitude larger than in the motif ORF mode, resulting in an increased false discovery rate (FDR). Because MetaMiner only reports statistically significant peptide spectrum matches, the all ORF mode may miss some peptides identified in the motif ORF mode. Conversely, because MetaMiner searches more ORFs in the all ORF mode than in the motif ORF mode, the motif ORF mode may miss some peptides identified in the all ORF mode.\n\nFigure S1shows a comparison of the performance of MetaMiner with all ORF and motif ORF genome mining approaches on the ACTI dataset. At the extremely conservative 0% FDR, MetaMiner in the motif ORF mode identified three unknown RiPPs and five known RiPPs. MetaMiner in the all ORF mode identified only two known RiPPs at 0% FDR. Note that while the all ORF mode improves on the motif ORF mode for the STANDARD dataset, the motif ORF mode improves on the all ORF mode for the ACTI dataset.\n\nMetaMiner identified 31 known RiPPs and discovered seven unknown RiPPs in various datasets, including Actinomyces strains, Bacillus strains, Cyanobacteria strains, sponge microbiome, microbial isolates from the International Space Station, and human microbiome (seeSTAR methodsfor details).Table S1provides information about all the RiPPs identified at 1% FDR by MetaMiner. Among the 31 known RiPPs, 23 were identified in the strains identical to the previous reports, three were identified in strains with 99% or higher 16S rRNA similarity, two were identified in the same species, one was identified in the same genus, and two were identified in the same samples (Table S2,Figures S7 S11,S13). The seven unknown RiPPs belong to various classes, including lanthipeptides, lassopeptides, cynobactins, and phenol soluble modulins classes (Figure 2). Their putative biosynthetic gene clusters contain all the essential genes responsible for the modifications (Figures 2,S2 S6,S12, andS14).\n\nChemotypes and putative gene clusters of seven unknown RiPPs discovered by MetaMiner as well as wewakazole. In the column chemotype, post translationally modified amino acids are shown in bold red. In the precursor column, the green part will be cut and modified, to produce the chemotype. In gene cluster, different colors indicate different types of proteins annotated by DFAST (Tanizawa et al., 2018) and HMMER (Eddy, 2011).\n\nMetaMiner identified wewakazole in a polar fraction from the extract of the strain PNG26APR06 4, a marine cyanobacterium collected at Kape Point, Papua New Guinea. Wewakazole was first reported by the co authors of this paper (W.H.G.) from another Papua New Guinea collection ofLyngbya majuscula(revised toMoorea producens) obtained from Wewak Bay (Nogle et al., 2003). Subsequently a related compound, wewakazole B was isolated from a Red Sea collection of this cyanobacterium (Lopez et al., 2016). To validate the MetaMiner's identification of wewakazole from strain PNG26APR06 4, reverse phase C18column chromatography and preparative HPLC separations were successful in the isolation of 31.2 ug of this compound. The compound possessed the same molecular formula as wewakazole, C59H72N12O12, based on the molecular ion sodium adduct [M+Na]+in the HR ESI MS(m/z1163.5282,Figure S15). Its chemical identity was further confirmed utilizing1H, HSQC and HMBC NMR data, which allowed for direct comparison with data previously reported for wewakazole (Supplementary Figure S16 S18) (Nogle et al., 2003). Moreover, the tandem mass spectrum and retention time of the isolated compound matched the data previously reported for wewakazole (Figures S19andS20) (Nogle et al., 2003). Furthermore, the ECCD spectrum resembled that of wewakazole B (Lopez et al., 2016), and the specific rotation showed the same sign as previously reported for wewakazole (Nogle et al., 2003), excluding the possibility of an enantiomeric relationship of this isolate to that of wewakazole (Figure S21). Thus, the compound identified by MetaMiner was isolated and its identity was confirmed as wewakazole.",
    "discussion": "While recent genome mining efforts have revealed over 20,000 hypothetical RiPP encoding biosynthetic gene clusters (Hadjithomas et al., 2015), only 35 RiPPs matching these biosynthetic gene clusters have been identified so far. To keep pace with the speed of microbial genome sequencing, high throughput methods for structure elucidation of RiPPs are needed that combine metagenomics, genome mining, and peptidomics. MetaMiner extends our previous RiPPquest tool (limited to lanthipeptides) to lassopeptides, LAPs, linaridins, glycocins, cyanobactins, and proteusins, and enables the blind search for RiPPs with unusual modifications.\n\nStudies describing RiPPs are usually limited to the analysis of a single peptide or a few related peptides. The first application of MetaMiner revealed many known RiPPs, as well as their unknown analogs, and seven novel RiPPs (three lanthipeptide, one lassopeptide, two peptide spectrum matches and one cyclic cyanobactin) along with their numerous analogs, from only eight spectral datasets. MetaMiner identifications were validated by the isolation of the RiPP metabolite wewakezole and confirmation of its structure by orthogonal approaches, confirming that the MetaMiner prediction was correct. In contrast to the existing genome mining approaches that rely on known biosynthetic gene cluster motifs (Weber et al., 2015), MetaMiner in the all ORF mode has the ability to discover unknown biosynthetic gene clusters (with previously unknown motifs) that encode novel RiPPs (e.g. Compound Bac ISS 2196 and cyanobactin X) that are very different from all the currently known RiPPs and thus are not captured by the existing genome mining tools. MetaMiner can potentially make RiPP identification as robust as peptide identification in the traditional proteomics.\n\nWe further evaluated the performance of MetaMiner on eight paired mass spectral and genomics/metagenomics datasets. In a positive control dataset collected on various isolated RiPPs, MetaMiner correctly identified all the 18 known RiPPs. In a dataset collected on variousActinomycesstrains, MetaMiner identified eight RiPPs, among which five have been previously reported in similar strains. In a dataset collected on sponge microbiome, MetaMiner successfully discovered a known compound polytheonamide previously reported in the same sample. In a dataset ofBacillusstrains, a known RiPP lichenicidin is discovered in an unknown producer. In a dataset collected on strains from the human microbiome, MetaMiner discovered an interesting known quorum sensing autoinducer peptide from aStaphylococcusstrain. Moreover, MetaMiner identified multiple phenol soluble modulins, a class of secreted staphylococcal peptides that have the ability to lyse human neutrophils, the main cellular defense line againstStaphylococcus aureusinfection. The production of AIP and phenol soluble modulins have been previously reported in related Staphylococcus strains, but this is the first time these molecules are identified in the human microbiome. MetaMiner also identified a known RiPP, wewakezole, in a cyanobacterial strain, which was confirmed by subsequent isolation and identification by nuclear magnetic resonance.\n\nIn this paper we used a target decoy strategy to control the false discovery rate of MetaMiner. For each dataset, we reported all the RiPPs identified at 1% FDR threshold. This resulted in the identification of 38 RiPPs after analyzing 10 million spectra. While the discovery of only 38 RiPPs might look pessimistic at first glance, our spectral networking analysis shows that these 10 million spectra cluster into only 8071 families. Moreover, searching these families against known chemical structures using Dereplicator+ shows that many of these families belong to non ribosomal peptides, polyketides, terpenes and other classes of natural products. While the discovery of 38 RiPPs by searching 10 million spectra provides a proof of concept for the MetaMiner method, the presented method is applicable to any mass spectral / genomics / metagenomics data collected on the isolated microbes/microbial communities.\n\nCurrently, only 1% of the spectra from GNPS dataset has been searched against the genomic/metagenomic references using MetaMiner. The other 99% of the spectra in GNPS are not accompanied with the genomics/metagenomics data, making it impossible to search them. Recent genome/metagenome mining studies have revealed hundreds of thousands of biosynthetic gene clusters with uncharacterized small molecules from the publicly available genomic / metagenomic data in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and the Joint Genome Institute (JGI) repositories. A portion of the unannotated spectra in GNPS datasets are likely formed by the small molecule products of biosynthetic gene clusters from these publicly available genomes/metagenomes.\n\nMetaMiner enables rapid search of billions of mass spectra from GNPS infrastructure against the metagenomics/reference genome datasets collected on the microbial communities. MetaMiner is capable of searching large metagenomics and mass spectral datasets in order to construct catalogues of unknown antimicrobial molecules that can be used as drug leads in high throughput screening efforts.",
