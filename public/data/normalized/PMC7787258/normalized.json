    "abstract": "Understanding the effects of microgravity on human organs is crucial to exploration of low earth orbit, the moon, and beyond.Drosophilacan be sent to space in large numbers to examine the effects of microgravity on heart structure and function, which is fundamentally conserved from flies to humans. Flies reared in microgravity exhibit cardiac constriction with myofibrillar remodeling and diminished output. RNA sequencing (RNA seq) in isolated hearts revealed reduced expression of sarcomeric/extracellular matrix (ECM) genes and dramatically increased proteasomal gene expression, consistent with the observed compromised, smaller hearts and suggesting abnormal proteostasis. This was examined further on a second flight in which we found dramatically elevated proteasome aggregates co localizing with increased amyloid and polyQ deposits. Remarkably, in long QT causingsei/hERGmutants, proteasomal gene expression at 1g, although less than the wild type expression, was nevertheless increased in microgravity. Therefore, cardiac remodeling and proteostatic stress may be a fundamental response of heart muscle to microgravity.",
    "methods": "Additional information and/or requests for resources or reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the Lead Contact, Dr. Karen Ocorr (kocorr@sbpdiscovery.org).\n\nThis study did not generate unique antibodies, genetic lines, reagents, software, or equipment.\n\nIncluded inSupplemental datais post analysis normalized counts from DSeq2 for all identified genes across all samples sets in triplicate. Raw read counts and FASTQ files have been made available at the community endorsed public repository at NASA Gene Labhttps://genelab data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS 347.\n\nFly lines used in this study wereCanton Slaboratory WT lines (Bloomington Stock Center) and a K+channel mutantseizure(seizurets1, a gift from Dr. Barry Ganetsky). Thesei/hERG mutantswere previously isolated in a screen for ethylmethane sulfonate (EMS) induced paralytic mutations on the second chromosome (Titus et al., 1997). Flies launched to the International Space Station (space flown, SF) and the corresponding ground controls (GC) were housed in polystyrene vials (75 x24 mm) with 10 mL of standard cornmeal based fly food containing double the usual amount of 10% Tegosept and cellulose acetate plugs. Approximately 24 hours prior to launch, 15 vials were each loaded with 10 virgin females and 5 male adult flies. Loaded vials were placed in a Plexiglas tray and inserted into a vented fly box (VFB;Figure 1A), a modified version of a Nanoracks box. The VFB was placed into a canvas case for loading into the Dragon capsule. Launch of SpaceX CRS 3 occurred at 19:25 UTC on April 18, 2014. Flies were kept in the VFB throughout the 30 day mission and were stored aboard the docked Dragon capsule that shared atmosphere with the ISS. The Dragon capsule unberthed at 13:26 UTC (Co ordinated Universal Time) on May 18, 2014 and re entry into the Earth's atmosphere occurred the same day at 19:05 UTC. Following retrieval of the Dragon capsule off the coast of Mexico, the VFB was offloaded at Long Beach Port, California and transported by car to La Jolla, California in a climate controlled vehicle. Surviving adult flies were collected from the vials at 23:30 UTC on May 20, 2014. Data collection, which included heart function studies, tissue collection for RNaseq, and tissue preservation for immunohistochemistry, was completed by 07:30 UTC on May 21, 2014 on all ug space flown and corresponding ground control flies (specific methods described below). The protocol and associated timeline are outlined schematically inFigure 1. The VFB was oriented such that the g load was directed down into the food supply located at the bottom of the vials. This orientation was maintained throughout the entirety of the mission, from point of transfer at the lab at NASA Kennedy Space Center through stowage on the Dragon capsule, and again from Dragon un berthing to opening of the VFB in the lab at SBP Medical Discovery Institute in La Jolla, California. Ground control flies were prepared and reared under identical conditions in ground based incubators with temperature and humidity controlled to levels recorded on the ISS.\n\nFollowing initial adult fly collections, vials were maintained for three days at 25 degreesC and adults that emerged were collected and aged as a mixed sex cohort for two weeks at 1g (Space Flight Recovery, SFR). These flies were then analyzed as for SF and GC flies.\n\nIdentical protocols were followed for the launch of the PolyQ46 flies aboard SpaceX CRS 11 on June 03, 2017 at 21:07 UTC until splashdown which occurred at 12:12 UTC on July 03, 2017. VFBs were again returned to Long Beach Port, California and transported via a climate controlled vehicle to La Jolla, California on the same day, arriving at approximately 03:00 UTC on July 5, 2017. All dissections and fixation of heart tissue (described below) were performed within 48 hours of arrival in La Jolla.\n\nFlies were anaesthetized with FlyNap (Carolina Biological Supply Co, Burlington, NC) and dissected in artificial hemolymph as previously described (Vogler and Ocorr, 2009). Cardiac function was assayed using high speed digital imaging (100 150fps, 9300 EM CCD cameras, Hamamatsu Corp.). Heart function was quantified from movies using the Semi automatic Optical Heartbeat Analysis software (SOHA;sohasoftware.com;Ocorr, 2009). Contractility was estimated based on end diastolic (EDD) and end systolic (ESD) diameters, measured from moves using SOHA. (i.e., fractional shortening = (EDD ESD)/EDD). Cardiac output (CO) was calculated assuming the heart is a cylindrical tube, where volume was estimated using V = (r2)x h, for a 1 micron portion of the tube (h = 1). Thus, Stroke Volume (SV) = ((1/2(EDD2) ((1/2(ESD2) and cardiac output ) = mean heart rate x SV.\n\nDissected hearts previously used for the heart function assays were subsequently relaxed with EGTA (10mM in artificial hemolymph) and then immediately fixed for 20 minutes in a solution of hemolymph containing 4% paraformaldehyde. All hearts were stained as described inAlayari et al. (2009). Collagen IV was visualized using a monoclonal antibody against Pericardin, obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank and developed under the auspices of the NICHD and maintained by The University of Iowa, Department of Biology, Iowa City, IA 52242. Proteasomes were visualized using an antibody against 20S proteasome subunits a1,2,3,5,6 & 7 (BML PW8195, Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY). PolyQ GFP plaques were identified using Mouse anti GFP (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) The following secondary antibodies were used: anti rabbit IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 and anti mouse IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor 594 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) F actin was detected using Phalloidin Alexa Fluor 594 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Stained hearts were visualized with a Zeiss Apotome microscope; Z stack images were captured and processed with Axiovision software (Zeiss).\n\nPericardin, proteosome and polyQ46 GFP staining was quantified using the Weka Trainable Segmentation plugin in ImageJ (Schneider et al., 2012). Individual slices from Z stack images of heart chambers were constructed by optical sectioning of the heart tube starting at a point below the non cardiac longitudinal fibers. This optical sectioning revealed the pericardin fibers that interacted with the myofibrils in the dorsal myocardial cells. We selected a 350 x 150 pixel (90x 30 um) region of interest (ROI) centered over a heart chamber (Figures 3Eand3F) and a representative image (i.e.,Figure S6, left panel) was used for training; the model generated by the training was then applied to all images. Particle counts and area measurements were performed on the segmentation output images (Figure S6, middle panel) using ImageJ analysis tools (Figure S6, right panel).\n\nSarcomere numbers were quantified from Z stacks of hearts stained for F actin(with phalloidin). Two to three 30um segments of single myofilaments were identified in myocardial cells from each heart (Figure S3) and the number of sarcomeres were counted and averaged for each heart.\n\nGene expression analysis was performed on a subset of adult fly hearts from both 1g ground control flies and flies that spent their entire existence in ug. For each genotype, adultDrosophilawere dissected under artificial hemolymph as described inVogler and Ocorr (2009), on ice to expose the heart. These hearts were then carefully cleaned of surrounding fat cells, extracted, and pooled in groups of 6 15 hearts. Hearts were placed into tubes containing 300 uL of Qiazol lysis reagent, homogenized per the QIAGEN protocol, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and transferred to  80 degreesC for storage. Total RNA from each sample was extracted and purified using the miRNeasy Mini kit from QIAGEN (Cat. No. 217004), yielding 173~551 ng of RNA eluted in 30 uL of RNase free water. The integrity of the extracted RNA was assessed by Agilent 2200 Tapestation system (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA), indicating RIN numbers in the range of 8.3 to 9.6. RNA samples of high quality and sufficient RNA quantities were selected for further processing.\n\nLibraries of extracted RNA samples were built using the Illumina TruSeq RNA sample preparation kit and yielded fragments with 200~500 base pairs. The qualified fragments were ligated with indexed adapters, amplified and subjected for sequencing by Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) to generate paired end reads with a length of 100 bases.\n\nA total of 8.02 billion reads were generated in FASTQ format for 24 samples, yielding coverage in the range of 35 152 bases for each sample. The quality of reads was evaluated by FASTX Toolkit (Hannon Lab, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, USA), where all reads indicated excellent quality with an average quality score of 37. The reads were then aligned to theDrosophila melanogastergenome Ensembl.BDGP5 using TopHat2 and Bowtie2 .The aligned reads were then assembled using BEDTools (Quinlan and Hall, 2010). The samples with low alignment rate and biased expression patterns were excluded from further analyses. Expression of mRNAsin qualified samples were then normalized as Reads Per Kilobase per Million reads (RPKM) by AltAnalyze (Salomonis et al., 2009). Genes with insufficient copy numbers were filtered out before conducting further statistical analyses.\n\nDifferentially expressed genes were determined using a one way ANOVA analysis considering a p value of 0.05. Pathway enrichment analysis was performed by comparing differentially expressed genes with Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases using a Fisher's exact test based method (Evangelou et al., 2012) where p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.\n\nQuantification methods for the various parameters are described in the relevantMethodsSection. Statistical analyses were performed using Prism (Graph Pad, v.9). The specific tests used are indicated in the Figure legends. P values for significant differences are indicated in the graphs. All graphs show the individual data points used in the analysis.",
    "results": "We used vented fly boxes (VFBs) to carry multiple vials of adultDrosophila, each with 10 females and 5 males, to the ISS (see protocol schematic;Figure 1A). Eggs laid on the food in the bottom of the vials hatched into larva that then metamorphosed into adults in about 10 12 days, all under microgravity. VFBs and vials containing live adult flies were returned to earth gravity, and flies were processed within ~2 days of exposure to 1g(space flown [SF] flies). We also collected flies that emerged from those same vials at 1g(days 3 5 after splash down) and aged them for 2 weeks at 1gbefore processing (space flight recovery [SFR]).\n\nFor cardiac function assays, flies were dissected under artificial hemolymph and allowed to equilibrate for 15 30 min in fresh, aerated, artificial hemolymph. The contracting hearts were filmed with high speed digital cameras (140 160 frames/s [fps]) for subsequent heart function analysis (Fink et al., 2009;Ocorr et al., 2007). Measurements of heart diameters were made at the widest portion of the second abdominal chamber during systole and diastole. Exposure to microgravity resulted in significant reductions in end diastolic diameters (EDDs) of SF CS female fly hearts compared with hearts from ground controls (GCs) (Figure 1B, top left). This reduction was not the result of changes in the overall size of female flies because there was no significant difference in body length in response to microgravity (Figure S1A). There was a trend toward reduced diastolic diameters in male flies, which did not reach statistical significance, as well as a small reduction in the overall body length of SF CS males (Figures 1B, bottom left, andS1A). No significant effects of microgravity were observed on end systolic diameters (ESDs) under microgravity in either sex (Figure 1C). Importantly, both sexes showed significant decreases in fractional shortening ([EDD   ESD]/[EDD]), which is an indirect measure of cardiac contractility (Figure 1D). The functional consequence of reduced diameters in females was a highly significant reduction in cardiac output (Figure 1E).\n\nAs previously observed (Ocorr et al., 2017), cardiac size and output insei/hERGmutant hearts were already significantly reduced at 1gcompared with CS hearts (Figures 1Band1C). Interestingly, there was a small but significant increase in diastolic diameters in response to microgravity in hearts from femalesei/hERGmutants, which translated into a modest increase in the cardiac output (Figure 1C, top).\n\nThe length of time the heart spent in diastole and systole was also quantified from high speed movies. There were no significant differences between 1g  and microgravity exposed flies (Figures S1BandS1C). However, hearts from female SFR flies did show a significant increase in the systolic intervals, perhaps a response to increased load when returned to 1g. Male CS hearts showed significantly increased cardiac arrhythmia (Figure S1D, bottom; arrhythmia index [AI], a measure of beat to beat variability) (Ocorr et al., 2007), which was not seen in SFR flies. The AI trended higher in females but did not reach the level of significance (Figure S1D, top). We observed the expected bradycardia and increased arrhythmia insei/hERGmutant flies compared with CS controls at 1g, but it was not significantly worsened in microgravity (Figures S1B S1D). Representative high speed videos of hearts from both lines reared under 1gand microgravity are provided (Video S1).\n\nAfter filming for cardiac functional analyses, hearts were removed and processed for transcriptomic analysis. Hierarchical cluster analyses from triplicate samples from CS 1g(CS_G), CS microgravity exposed (CS_S), sei/hERG 1g(sei_G), and sei/hERG microgravity exposed (sei_S) flies were performed. The results showed that triplicates from each genotype and condition clustered within their respective group. Genotypes clustered at shorter distances then those with microgravity exposure.\n\nHearts from WT CS flies reared in microgravity compared with 1gGCs showed upregulation of 250 genes (1.25 fold; adjusted [adj.] p value <= 0.05); of which, 86 genes were increased >=2.0 fold (adj. p value <= 0.01) (Figure 2B). Ontological analysis of the 250 upregulated genes using the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) functional annotation bioinformatics microarray analysis showed an ~20 fold enrichment in proteasome mediated ubiquitin (Ub) dependent protein catabolism genes, a 23 fold enrichment in chromatin assembly and disassembly genes, and a 12 fold enrichment in genes with endopeptidase activity, among other ontologies (Table 1). Conversely, 618 genes were downregulated (1.25 fold; adj. p value <= 0.05); of which, 313 genes were decreased >=2.0 fold (adj. p value <= 0.01) (Figure 2B). Here, ontological analysis identified 2 fold or greater enrichment in gene subsets enriched for proteolysis, carbohydrate metabolic processes, and the ECM (Table 1).\n\n(A) Average linkage cluster analysis using Kendall's Tau distance measurement method comparing Canton S GCs (CS_G), Canton S microgravity exposed (CS_S),sei/hERGGCs (SEI_G), andsei/hERGmicrogravity exposed (SEI_S) fly hearts.

Ontological analysis of the 1,111 upregulated genes showed a 5.8 fold enrichment in chromatin assembly genes, 2 fold enrichment in proteolysis genes, and 2.9 fold increase in carbohydrate metabolic process genes, among other ontologies (Table 2). Conversely, 865 genes were downregulated (1.25 fold; adj. p value <= 0.05), with 256 genes >=2.0 fold (adj. p value <= 0.01) (Figures 2Aand2B). Here, ontological analysis revealed a 4.4 fold enrichment in proteasome mediated Ub dependent catabolism genes, 1.9 fold enrichment in fatty acid elongation genes, and a 2.2 fold enrichment in cellular response to DNA damage genes, among other ontologies. Importantly, expression of many ECM related genes in hearts fromsei/hERGGC flies was already significantly reduced compared with WT GCs (Table 2).\n\nDifferential Gene Subset Expression inSEIMutants at 1gRelative to CS at 1g\n\nTable uses gene ontology (GO) terms.

Ontological analysis of the 840 upregulated genes showed a 5.4 fold enrichment in rRNA processing genes and a 4.8 fold enrichment in histone acetyltransferase genes, among other ontologies (Table 3). Conversely, 1,063 genes were downregulated (1.25 fold; adj. p value <= 0.05), with 582 genes decreased >=2.0 fold (adj. p value <= 0.01) (Figure 2B). Here, ontological analysis revealed a 2.4 fold enrichment in oxidative reduction, a 2.2 fold enrichment in proteolysis, and a 5.8 fold enrichment in cell adhesion via plasma membrane genes among other ontologies (Table 3).\n\nDifferentially Expressed Genes inSEIHearts under Microgravity\n\nTable uses gene ontology (GO) terms. Dir., direction; up, upregulated; dwn, downregulated; BP, biological process; MF, molecular function; CC, cellular localization; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway identification; FDR, false discovery rate.\n\nWe identified 38 genes that were commonly upregulated and 189 genes that were commonly downregulated in both WT and mutant hearts under microgravity (Figure 2B). Within the 38 commonly upregulated genes, we identified multiple proteasomal/Ub dependent protein catabolic genes, including ProsAlpha6, Rpn13, Npl4, and CG2046 (Table S1). Within the 189 downregulated genes, there was a 7.9 fold enrichment in carbohydrate metabolic process genes (Table S2;Figure S2). Half of those genes mapped specifically to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) glycerophospholipid metabolic pathway and included key conserved enzymes, such asAgat4, Gpdh1, Gpd2, and Gapdh1(Figure S2). Among downregulated genes, there was also a 3.2 fold enrichment in genes encoding proteins found in the ECM. In addition, oxidation reduction and proteolysis genes were enriched in commonly downregulated genes (Table S2; see alsoFigure S2). Nineteen genes were contra regulated. Volcano plots (Figure 2C) show the relative distribution of differentially expressed genes in CS andsei/hERG, normalized to their respective GCs. In general, more genes were downregulated than were upregulated under microgravity, with more genes differentially expressed at a higher magnitude inseicompared with CS. Adjusted read count data for all samples have been provided (Data S1). It should be noted that fruit fly hearts are very small, and the material isolated was insufficient to validate our RNA seq analyses, which were run in triplicate, with qPCR.\n\nWe examined the cardiac morphology of GC and microgravity reared flies in a subset of hearts used for the functional assays. Phalloidin staining of filamentous actin (F actin) revealed the myofibrillar structure within the myocardial cells that make up the heart tube (Figures 3A 3D). In CS GC hearts, the myofibrils are typically tightly packed and circumferentially arranged within those cells (Figure 3A), such that shortening of the sarcomeres results in a squeezing of the heart tube and ejection of the hemolymph present within the heart lumen (Video S1). Hearts from flies exposed to microgravity have myofibrils that are much more loosely arranged, with gaps, and were organized in a more longitudinal orientation compared with 1gcontrols (Figures 3Aand3B). Myofibrillar reorganization or remodeling has previously been documented in hearts fromsei/hERGmutants (Ocorr et al., 2017) and was again observed in hearts from 1gsei/hERGGCs (Figure 3C). However, hearts fromsei/hERGmutants reared in microgravity showed even more extensive myofibrillar reorganization and disarray than GCs, and F actin staining was diminished compared with GCs (Figure 3D).\n\n(A) z stack projection of one chamber of a heart from a GCCanton Sfly showing circumferentially arranged myofibrils stained for F actin (red, phalloidin) and the supporting collagen IV extracellular matrix (green, anti pericardin antibody [Ab]) that interacts extensively with the myofibrils.

Significance was determined by a two way ANOVA with Sidak's multiple comparison post hoc test.\n\n(H) Heatmap of significantly altered mRNA expression of sarcomere associated genes (top) and ECM genes (bottom). Data were normalized to the average expression across row for each gene (Zscore).\n\nTo further quantify myofibrillar structure, we calculated relative sarcomere lengths from our F actin stained z stack images (Figure S3) by quantifying the number of sarcomeres per 30 um myofilament length. Sarcomere number was significantly reduced under microgravity for both female and male Canton S flies (Figure S3), suggesting that hearts from SF flies were capable of generating less force than their GC siblings. Sarcomere counts in Canton S SFR hearts were not different from GC hearts and, for heart diameters, there were no significant differences among any of the hearts from sei/hERG mutants (Figure S3).\n\nIn conjunction with the myofibrillar remodeling, we also observed a significant reorganization of the ECM surrounding the heart. In theDrosophilaheart, this extracellular network consists primarily of the collagen IV homolog pericardin. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that network of collagen IV fibers surrounding the heart (Figure 3), and we show that it partially co localizes with the z band protein alpha actinin (Figures S4A S4H). In GC CS flies, those collagen fibers run orthogonally over the myofibrils of myocardial cells (Figures 3Aand3E) to form what appears to be a stabilizing network. Hearts from female CS flies reared in microgravity showed noticeable reductions in that myofiber associated network (Figures 3Band3F), consistent with the myofibrillar remodeling. Quantification of the cardiac muscle associated networks showed that this reduction was significant in SF female hearts (Figure 3G), although the decrease seen for CS male flies did not reach significance (Figure 3G). This result was unexpected because cardiomyopathy from compromised heart function is usually accompanied byincreasedcollagen deposition, i.e., fibrosis.\n\nThis myofibril associated collagen network insei/hERGmutant GCs (Figures 3Cand3G) was already significantly reduced compared with that of CS GCs (Figures 3Band3G), also likely a reflection of the previously observed myofibrillar remodeling in these mutants at 1g(Ocorr et al., 2017). Interestingly, we did observeintra chamberfibrosis in a large percentage of hearts analyzed fromseimutants on the ground (arrows inFigures 2C,3C, and3C), something we rarely observed in CS flies at 1gor microgravity. At 1g, 60% ofsei/hERGversus 1% of CS females and 65% ofsei/hERGversus 16% CS males showed evidence of intra chamber collagen IV localization (p < 0.005, Mann Whitney unpaired t test for both males and females). Unexpectedly, most hearts from SFsei/hERGfemales exhibited only faint collagen fibers, and there were large globular aggregates of collagen in the cardiac lumen as well as deposits that appeared to fill in gaps between myofibrils (Figures 3D,3D, and3D). Hearts from SFsei/hERGmales exhibited more extensive pericardin networks compared with SFsei/hERGfemales, but those networks were also reduced in microgravity compared withsei/hERGmale GCs (Figure 3G).\n\nThe observed structural and morphological changes (Figures 3A 3Dand3G) correlate with a complex misexpression of various cardiac sarcomeric genes, (Figure 3H, top). Control and mutant flies exposed to microgravity exhibit downregulation of human actin orthologs, includingActin88F(hACTB) andActin79b(hACTA/B). However, unique to CS, expression of the sarcomeric organizational genebasigin(hBSG), z band localized metabolic genesGAPDH1andGPDH, and unconventional myosinjaguar(jar) (hMYO6) were reduced, whereas the later three were upregulated insei/hERGflies under 1g. Conversely, sarcomeric organizational generolling pebbles(rols) (hTANC2) was upregulated in CS in microgravity. Interestingly, reduced expression of a variety of myosin related genes was observed exclusively insei/hERGmutants under microgravity, includingmyosin heavy chain(Mhc) (hMHC7),myosin light chain1(Mlh1) (hMYL1),Myo10A(hMYO15A), andTropomyosin 1(Tm1) (hTPM1).\n\nAdditionally, the observed changes in ECM content and morphology also correlated with misexpression of collagen/ECM regulatory genes (Figure 3H, bottom). Both control and mutant flies exposed to microgravity exhibit downregulation ofprocollagen lysyl hydroxylase(plod) (hPLOD1 3) andlysyl oxidase 1(lox) (hLOXL2). These collagen maturation genes promote collagen cross linking and ECM formation. However, in SF CS flies, the collagen network degradative gene,matrix metalloproteinase 1(MMP1) (hMMP14/24), was also downregulated. Insei/hERGmutants, cardiacMMP1expression was elevated under both gravity conditions, relative to CS. However, for CS,MMP2(hMMP15) expression was reduced in microgravity. CS flies exhibited a reduction in multiple collagen type IV encoding genes, includingCg25C(hCOL4A1),viking(vkg) (hCOL4A1),Col4a1(hCOL4A1/2/6), andpericardin(prc), as well as collagen and fibrinogen domain containing CG30280 (hFIBCD1) and CG31832 (hFCN1). Interestingly, most of these genes are upregulated insei/hERGat 1gcompared with CS, as would be expected under pathological cardiac remodeling conditions. Nevertheless, their expression shows a similar reduction under microgravity. The notable exceptions are the elevated CG30282 (seeFigure 3H) expression insei/hERGmutants, which remains high in space. Importantly, this misexpression of cell adhesion genes may underlie the observed misregulation of the pericardin network under microgravity (Figure S5).\n\nRemarkably, nearly all the genes encoding proteasome subunits were significantly upregulated under microgravity in hearts from CS WT flies (Figure 4A). In contrast, at 1g, proteasome gene expression was already reduced in the hearts fromsei/hERGmutants relative to CS. Nevertheless, microgravity exposure also resulted in upregulation of cardiac proteasome genes insei/hERGmutants relative to theirsei/hERGGCs (Figure 4A), albeit to levels that were still reduced relative to CS GCs. Our observation that cardiac proteasome gene expression was significantly upregulated in response to microgravity suggested that protein folding had been compromised and/or degradation was elevated. We had a fortunate and unique opportunity to test that hypothesis on a subsequent mission launched to the ISS aboard SpaceX commercial resupply service (CRS) 11 using the same protocol as for CRS 03. For this study, we generated flies that expressed UAS polyQ46 GFP only in the myocardial cells using a tinC4 Gal4 driver. This GFP tagged 46 glutamine repeat polypeptide (PolyQ46) is an intermediate length between disease causing polyQ repeat lengths and the WT polyQ containing proteins (Melkani et al., 2013). Previous studies have shown that treatment with agents that increase reactive oxygen species in the heart increase the number and size of GFP positive plaques (Melkani et al., 2013) in UAS polyQ46 GFP expressing hearts. In this respect, polyQ46 acts as a marker for protein misfolding and aggregation under cardiac proteostatic stress.\n\n(A) Expression of mRNA encoding many proteasome subunits is dramatically increased by exposure to microgravity in hearts from CS SF flies compared with CS GCs. Hearts fromsei/hERGmutant GCs have much lower expression of these same subunits, and the expression is not altered by microgravity. Each box is the average of triplicate samples normalized to the overall averaged expression for all hearts.\n\n(B and C) Images from a single cardiac chamber in GC (B) and SF (C) CS female flies homozygous for Hand gal4 > UAS polyQ46GFP. Immunohistochemical staining showed proteasome immunoreactivity (red) and PolyQ GFP (green); scale bar, 10 um. Merged images show co localization of some GFP positive plaques and proteasome aggregates. Myocardial cell nuclei are stained with DAPI (blue).\n\n(D and E) GFP particle count (D) and total area (E) were increased in hearts from females (red symbols) but not males (blue symbols) under microgravity.\n\n(F) Proteasome particle count was significantly higher in females compared with males and was significantly increased in female hearts in response to microgravity.\n\n(G) Proteasome aggregate total area was also significantly increased in females but not in males.\n\nFor all graphs, significance was determined by two way ANOVA and Tukey's multiple comparisons post hoc test. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.005.\n\nImmunohistochemical analysis (Figure S6F) of hearts from GC flies exhibited GFP positive plaques and anti proteasome puncta (Figure 4C; GC), which were typically found near myocardial cell nuclei. Hearts from microgravity reared flies had significantly more GFP positive polyQ plaques (Figure 4D) covering a larger area of the heart (Figure 4E) compared with 1gcontrols. Proteasome puncta were also more abundant (Figure 4F), covering a larger total area (Figure 4G) of the heart. In addition, in myocardial cells, a significant amount of alpha proteasome \"haze\" was observed, which could represent less highly aggregated proteasomes (Figure 4C; SF). Taken together, these data suggest that, in the heart in space, proteasomal gene and protein expression is dramatically upregulated, although proteosomes are likely dysfunctional, as manifest by co localized proteasomal and polyQ aggregates.",
    "discussion": "As humans increasingly venture into our interplanetary space, it will be important to understand the different ways in which prolonged exposure to alteredgforces affect organ systems that have evolved under 1g. Muscle function is known to be affected by prolonged weightlessness, but most studies address the \"bulk\" properties of muscle fibers, leaving the cellular and mechanistic causes relatively unexplored. Knowledge of the biomechanical properties of filaments is important because those filaments reveal how molecular properties scale up and how bulk properties of muscle fibers are dictated by nanoscale phenomena. The current work, using the genetically tractableDrosophilamodel, provides new and unique insights into microgravity effects on muscle cells at the molecular level and also facilitates insightful structural and functional cardiac phenotyping at the organismal level. Similar to humans, exposure to microgravity has profound effects on fly muscle function, as has been previously reported for flies exposed to microgravity for short durations (2 weeks) (Miller and Keller, 1999).\n\nHeart function analysis in our denervated, semi intact preparations confirmed a cardiac specific effect of space flight, with heart chamber size and cardiac contractility and output being significantly reduced under microgravity (Figures 1B,1D, and1E). These findings were consistent with observed myofibrillar remodeling (Figures 3A 3D), reduced sarcomere count (Figure S3), and misregulation of sarcomeric genes (Figure 3H), including actins, myosins and tropomyosin, and sarcomere organizational genes. Troponin mutations that interfere with tropomyosin binding have already been documented in the fly heart to cause cardiac dysfunction, cardiac restriction, and myofibrillar disarray (Madan et al., 2020;Viswanathan et al., 2014), similar to our observation in space flies. In addition, we previously observed that specific myosin transducer mutations that affect rates of ATP hydrolysis have differential effects on myofibrillar structure, including restrictive (when rates are faster) and dilatory (when rates are slower) cardiomyopathies (Cammarato et al., 2008). We have also shown that mutations in unc 45, a chaperone involved in myosin protein folding, significantly alter myofibrillar structure in the fly heart (Melkani et al., 2011). Although a role for Myo10A (Sisyphus) has not yet been described in the heart, it has been shown to promote transport of cell adhesion cargo and to bind integrins, which we have previously shown to be critical to cardiac structure and function (Nishimura et al., 2014), thus suggesting a possible role for this unconventional myosin in the heart. Sarcomeric contractile and structural proteins provide the fundamental molecular basis for cardiac function and have well established roles in the etiology of a variety of cardiac diseases (Marston, 2018). Our studies show that prolonged exposure to microgravity is associated with transcriptional misexpression of sarcomeric genes, cardiomyocyte myofibrillar disorganization, and ultimately, cardiac contractile dysfunction. Lack of an effect on overall chronotropy, along with an increased incidence of arrhythmia in male flies is consistent with findings in human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (Wnorowski et al., 2019).\n\nUnder pathological cardiomyopathy conditions, collagen deposition is usually increased leading to fibrosis, which contributes to impaired contractility. Surprisingly, the collagen IV network that normally surrounds and attaches to the cardiomyocytes was decreased under microgravity. Remodeling occurred in both CS and, to a greater extent, insei/hERGmutant hearts, which also exhibited intra lumen fibrosis and collagen aggregation. These observations were consistent with misexpression of collagen and ECM maturation and degradative genes, as well as collagen and cell adhesion encoding genes. Although fibrosis is generally associated with cardiac disease, ECM degradation is an observed feature in both the volume overloaded heart and in end stage diastolic remodeling from pressure overload (Frangogiannis, 2019). ECM degradation is associated with features of contractile dysfunction, inflammation, and cardiomyocyte apoptosis, potentially due in part to loss of matrix dependent signals that are required for preservation of function. Additionally, misregulation of ECM composition has also been implicated in cardiac disease. Taken together, ECM remodeling is a potential maladaptive effect of prolonged exposure to microgravity in our model and may be a contributing factor to the observed cardiac dysfunction.\n\nExpression of basigin, a transmembrane protein (Suzuki et al., 2016) involved in sarcomeric organization, was significantly downregulated insei/hERGmutant hearts relative to WT at 1g, but exposure to microgravity resulted in an increased expression insei/hERGmutants. Basigin has been shown to promote cardiac fibrosis in pressure overload models and to activate matrix metalloproteinases that degrade ECM components and thus promote ECM remodeling. This is consistent with the expression of MMP1 maintained insei/hERGmutants compared with CS and may have a role in the dramatic collagen IV remodeling in SFsei/hERGmutant hearts. This sarcomeric modification may serve to stiffen the heart wall, allowing cardiac output to be maintained in mutants at microgravity, despite the myofibrillar remodeling and overall reduced expression of muscle structural proteins. Interestingly, basigin (CD147) has recently emerged as a potential receptor for SARS CoV 2 (Zhou et al., 2020).\n\nGap junctions are important intercellular connections among cardiomyocytes, allowing the organ to work as a syncytium. They are composed of connexins in vertebrates and innexins in flies. Innexin 2 and 3 have both been shown to be present in the fly heart (Cammarato et al., 2011). Under microgravity conditions innexin 2 is significantly downregulated in both CS ( 1.76 fold; p = 0.002) and insei/hERGmutant hearts ( 1.59 fold; p = 0.045), whereas innexin 3 expression is altered only insei/hERGmutants ( 1.8 fold; p = 0.002). Together with the reduction in genes encoding cell adhesion proteins, it is likely that electrotonic coupling of the myocardial cells was impaired.\n\nAnother surprising finding was the significant upregulation of genes encoding nearly every subunit of the proteasome. We were able to confirm that microgravity exposure resulted in an increase in protein aggregates and associated proteasome particles on a subsequent flight. The increase in polyQ GFP aggregates and proteasome puncta suggests that microgravity induces dramatic changes in protein turnover and/or protein misfolding. Recent evidence indicates that oligomers, such as huntingtin/PolyQ proteins, bind to and inhibit proteasomes by preventing injection of proteins into the degradation chamber (Thibaudeau et al., 2018). Additionally, proteasome dysfunction has been suggested as a causative factor and is observed in a variety of cardiomyopathies (Gilda and Gomes, 2017), heart failure, and cardiac amyloidosis (Pattison et al., 2008;Sanbe et al., 2005). We have also shown in flies that cardiac amyloidosis caused structural remodeling reminiscent of the remodeling observed in flies reared in microgravity (Melkani et al., 2013). The increase in proteosome gene and protein expression in space may reflect increased turnover of sarcomeric proteins or may be a compensatory response to the likely muted proteosome function by misfolded and aggregated proteins. This interpretation is consistent with smaller hearts and less muscle mass, as in astronauts, and could be contributing to the observed cardiac remodeling and functional defects. Interestingly, in hearts from K+channel mutants, expression of nearly all proteasome genes was already downregulated at 1gcompared with WT controls. Nevertheless, proteasome gene expression was modestly upregulated in hearts from space reared mutants suggesting that this may be a fundamental response of cardiac muscle to lowered gravity. It is likely that this generalized increase in proteasome content underlies cardiac muscle atrophy.\n\nIn contrast to the increase in proteasomes, expression of proteolytic genes was generally downregulated in microgravity. Recent quantitative analyses of human cardiac fuel usage showed that non failing hearts undergo proteolysis and actively secrete amino acids. This process was nearly doubled in failing versus non failing hearts (Murashige et al., 2020). It was unclear whether upregulation of proteolysis was adaptive or maladaptive. In this context, it is interesting that SF fly hearts showed decreased expression, perhaps as a reflection of an overall reduction or shift in fuel usage by the heart under microgravity.\n\nThe current studies examined the effects of prolonged exposure to microgravity, whereas the exposure of astronauts is more temporally limited. However, future space exploration efforts by government and commercial ventures are focused on missions to the moon, asteroids, and Mars, and those explorations will require astronauts to spend many months and perhaps years in altered gravity. Thus, information on how prolonged microgravity exposure affects different organ systems will be critical to the success of those efforts (Criscuolo et al., 2020;Prasad et al., 2020). It is likely that, at the cellular level, there are underlying and conserved responses to altered gravity that are shared between organisms. Approximately 75% of disease causing genes are conserved between flies and humans. Thus, the fly model can have a key role in elucidating the effects of microgravity during prolonged space flight, with significant advantages over other model systems because of its small size, its well defined and conserved genetics, and its relatively short lifespan.",
