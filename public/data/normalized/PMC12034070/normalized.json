    "abstract": "Blood flow restriction training (BFRT) is a tool utilized in rehabilitation and injury prevention to improve muscle strength and size, particularly in load compromised individuals. BFRT facilitates gains in muscular strength and hypertrophy at lower loads, allowing for accelerated recovery and less disuse atrophy. BFRT must be applied appropriately and with caution, particularly in individuals with cardiovascular concerns. There are applications for BFRT across a wide spectrum of human performance training and in rehabilitation of both lower and upper extremity conditions, providing a high quality adjunct to improve muscle strength, power, and endurance.\n\nLevel V, expert opinion.",

    "conclusion": "BFRT has applications across the continuum of human performance, from immobilization, early rehabilitation with low loads, low intensity aerobic exercises, as part of a comprehensive strength and conditioning plan, and in recovery. The use of conventional strength training is strongly supported along with the inclusion of BFRT as an adjunct in the otherwise healthy population to optimize mechanical tension, muscle damage, and metabolic stress to drive muscle growth. It is our role as performance coaches and rehabilitation providers to restore, refine, and prepare the relevant structural and functional qualities of the individual for the task in which they will be participating. Muscular hypertrophy is a foundational performance precursor to be able to express and withstand the biomotor, sensorimotor, and bioenergetic demands of sport. BFRT is a progressive training stimulus that can be incorporated across a variety of populations, in number of applications, to produce a more resilient individual."
