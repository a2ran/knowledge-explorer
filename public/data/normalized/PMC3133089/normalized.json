    "abstract": "Salmonella entericaserovar Typhimurium possesses a stimulon of genes that are differentially regulated in response to conditions of low fluid shear force that increase bacterial virulence and alter other phenotypes. In this study, we show that a previously uncharacterized member of this stimulon,ydcIor STM1625, encodes a highly conserved DNA binding protein with related homologs present in a range of Gram negative bacterial genera. Gene expression analysis shows thatydcIis expressed in different bacterial genera and is involved in its autoregulation inS. Typhimurium. We demonstrate that purified YdcI protein specifically binds a DNA probe consisting of its own promoter sequence. We constructed anS. Typhimurium ydcImutant strain and show that this strain is more sensitive to both organic and inorganic acid stress than is an isogenic WT strain, and this defect is complemented intrans. Moreover, our data indicate thatydcIis part of therpoSregulon related to stress resistance. TheS. Typhimurium ydcImutant was able to invade cultured cells to the same degree as the WT strain, but a strain in whichydcIexpression is induced invaded cells at a level 2.8 times higher than that of the WT. In addition, induction ofydcIexpression inS. Typhimurium resulted in the formation of a biofilm in stationary phase cultures. These data indicate theydcIgene encodes a conserved DNA binding protein involved with aspects of prokaryotic biology related to stress resistance and possibly virulence.",
    "methods": "Please refer toTable 1for a list of strains and plasmids used in this study.S. Typhimurium strain 3339 was used as the wild type (WT), and all mutations were analyzed in this background (22). Construction of theS. Typhimurium ydcImutation was performed using lambda Red recombination as previously described (12,45) and by using the DNA primers listed in Table S1 in the supplemental material. A Cmrcassette from pKD3 (12) was inserted at nucleotide 166 of theS. TyphimuriumydcIopen reading frame (ORF) in the same orientation as theydcIORF. To obtain the ydcI::lacZfusion, the Cmrcassette at the site of the ydcImutation was deleted using Flp recombinase expressed from pCP20 (12), and then thelacZplasmid pCE36 (13) was inserted at the single FRT site at this location as previously described (13). To construct the WTydcI::lacZfusion, we performed an identical procedure by inserting the Cmrcassette immediately after the stop codon ofydcIand inserting pCE36 at this location. The strain containing Cm::lacZwas obtained by inserting the Cmr encoding gene from pKD3 immediately upstream of thelacZgene in the ydcI::lacZmutant strain using Red recombination such that the Cmr encoding gene promoter replaces theydcIpromoter and driveslacZexpression. All constructions were verified using PCR analysis. The rpoSmutation (which is marked by Apr) was transferred via P22 transduction from donor strain 4973 (38). To restore WTrpoSin the WTydcI::lacZrpoSstrain, a strain containing a Cmrmarker at gene STM2901 (located approximately 20 kb from therpoSgene) was used as a donor for P22 transduction, and Cmrrecipients were screened for ampicillin sensitivity (50). A CmrAprisolate from this transduction was used as a control. Plasmid pBAD18+ydcIwas constructed using a synthesizedydcIgene in which a six histidine tag was fused to the C terminus and cloned into pUC57 (56) and then subcloned into pBAD18 (24) downstream of the arabinose inducible promoter (Genscript, Inc., Piscataway, NJ). The entire length of the construct was verified via sequencing. Strains were grown using LB (Lennox) medium supplemented with the following antibiotics when necessary: ampicillin, 200 ug/ml; chloramphenicol, 10 ug/ml; kanamycin, 50 ug/ml.\n\nStrains and plasmids used in this study\n\nThe YdcI homologs from the indicated Gram negative species were identified using BLAST search analysis withS. Typhimurium YdcI (GenBank accession no.AAL20543) as the query (1). Homologs were aligned using CLUSTAL W analysis as previously described (46,51).\n\nReverse transcription (RT) PCR was performed as described previously (51,55), using approximately 4 to 6 ug RNA from late log phase cultures (optical density at 600 nm [OD600] = 0.9 to 1.4). RNA was isolated using RNA Protect reagent and RNeasy spin prep kits (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA). LacZ assays were performed with late log phase cultures using standard protocols as described previously (35), and the data presented represent the mean and standard deviation of three or four independent experiments each assayed in duplicate or triplicate reactions.\n\nEscherichia colistrain TOP10 containing pBAD18+ydcIwas grown to an OD600of approximately 0.5 to 0.8, induced with 0.1% arabinose, and then grown for an additional 3 h. Cells were harvested, lysed using B Per reagent (Pierce/Thermo Fisher, Rockford, IL), and processed for isolation of YdcI protein (with a six histidine tag) using nickel agarose spin columns in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (Zymo Research, Orange, CA). Coomassie staining and Western blot analysis with anti six histidine antibody (Immunology Consultants Lab, Inc., Newberg, OR) were performed using standard protocols as described previously (2,49,50).\n\nGel shift reactions were performed in the presence of 10 mM Tris HCl [pH 7.5], 50 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 ug salmon sperm DNA, and 0.1 ug/ml bovine serum albumin with approximately 1 ng of probe. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 20 min at room temperature before being loaded onto a prerun 8% acrylamide gel in 0.5x Tris borate EDTA (TBE) buffer at 150 V. Probe labeling and detection were performed using a nonradioactive kit in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce/Thermo Fisher, Rockford, IL) with positively charged nylon membrane (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). The 180 bp probe H3 consisted of DNA extending upstream from 38 bp downstream of theydcIATG codon (S. Typhimurium coordinates 1714755 to 1714935) that was PCR amplified using the primers indicated in Table S1 in the supplemental material and purified using a spin column in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (Zymo Research, Orange, CA). The 182 bp probe H5 consisted of DNA upstream of the H3 probe from coordinates 1714573 to 1714754, and thelacZprobe consisted of 152 bp amplified from thelacZgene using the primers indicated in Table S1 in the supplemental material. Competition assays were performed under the binding conditions described above with increasing amounts of a molar excess of unlabeled DNA that was either specific (the 180 bpydcIpromoter fragment) or nonspecific (lacZfragment), as indicated.\n\nStress assays were performed as described previously, using shaking broth cultures grown to stationary phase (39,52 54). The data presented represent the mean and standard deviation of four independent experiments each plated in triplicate.\n\nInvasion of Int407 intestinal epithelial cells and survival in J774 macrophages were assayed as described previously with a multiplicity of infection of approximately 30 using late log phase broth shaking cultures (49 52,54). The data (seeFig. 7) are from four to six independent experiments each performed in triplicate tissue culture wells, except for the pBAD18+lacZstrains, which are from three independent experiments performed in triplicate.\n\nInvasion of Int407 cells and survival in J774 macrophages. (A) The indicatedS. Typhimurium strains were tested for invasion of Int407 cells via gentamicin protection assay. The ratio of percent invasion of each strain to that of the control was calculated and graphed. The SPI 1 strain contains a deletion of the SPI 1 genes required for full invasion of Int407 cells. The SPI 1 and ydcImutant strains were compared to the WT for ratio calculation. The pBAD18, pBAD18+ydcI, and pBAD18+lacZstrains were compared to the WT pBAD18 strain under the corresponding arabinose condition for ratio calculation. (B) The indicated strains were tested for survival in J774 macrophages over a period of 18 to 20 h via gentamicin protection assay. The ratio of the percent survival of each strain to that of the control was calculated and graphed. For ratio calculations, the ydcImutant strain was compared to the WT and the pBAD18+ydcIstrain was compared to the pBAD18 strain.\n\nStrain 3339 containing pBAD18, pBAD18+ydcI, or pBAD18+lacZwas grown overnight in the absence of arabinose, diluted 1:50 in fresh medium, grown to an OD600of approximately 0.6 to 0.8, supplemented with arabinose to 0.1%, and grown for an additional 12 to 16 h. Crystal violet staining of biofilms and subsequent quantitation were performed as described previously (9,43).\n\nTo testS. Typhimurium responses to low fluid shear culture, the RWV bioreactor was used to grow cultures of each strain in the low fluid shear and control orientations as described previously (references52and53for acid stress and reference54for oxidative stress). The cultures were subjected to acid stress (pH 3.5 with citric acid) and oxidative stress (70 mM H2O2) and assayed for survival as described previously (references52and53for acid stress and54for oxidative stress). The results are from three to six independent RWV experiments each plated in triplicate.",
    "results": "We used theS. Typhimurium YdcI protein sequence (GenBank accession no.AAL20543) as a query in a BLAST search for homologs in the protein database. The results of this search indicated that the YdcI protein sequence belongs to the LysR family of transcriptional regulators and is highly conserved among Gram negative genomes, including the generaEscherichia,Shigella,Citrobacter,Enterobacter,Klebsiella, andSerratia(Fig. 1). The e values for the alignments inFig. 1are all less than 10 140, except that for theSerratiaprotein, which is 10 92. We also found that the YdcI protein is encoded byRalstonia,Pseudomonas,Burkholderia,Rhizobium,Agrobacterium,Brucella, andRuegeriaat a somewhat lower level of homology (e values between 10 71and 10 49) but still representing a high degree of conservation in these genera (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). The genomic organization of the location of theydcIgene in the genera fromFig. 1is also conserved (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). These results indicate that theydcIgene is conserved across multiple Gram negative genera and suggest evolutionary selection for the function of this gene in prokaryotic biology.\n\nAlignment of theS. Typhimurium YdcI protein with homologs present in a range of other Gram negative genera. Yellow highlighting indicates amino acid identity (in at least five of the proteins). The e values for the aligned proteins are less than 10 140, except for theSerratiaprotein, whose e value is 10 92.\n\nTo test if theydcIgene is expressed in different bacterial genera, we isolated total RNA from cultures ofS. Typhimurium,SalmonellaTyphi,Proteus mirabilis,Serratia marcescens,Klebsiella pneumoniae, andCitrobacter koseriand performed an RT PCR analysis using primers against theydcIhomolog in each strain. We detectedydcIhomolog expression via this assay indicating that this gene is able to be transcribed across genera (Fig. 2). To further analyzeydcIgene expression, we constructedlacZtranscriptional fusions in the chromosomal copy of theS. TyphimuriumydcIgene. Two such fusions were constructed; the WTydcI::lacZand ydcI::lacZalleles contain the promoterlesslacZgene fused immediately after theydcIstop codon and at nucleotide 166 of the 912 bpydcIgene, respectively (Fig. 3A). The latter construct is predicted to abolish normal YdcI protein function, thereby allowing comparison oflacZreporter expression in the presence and absence of WT YdcI protein. We found that the WTydcI::lacZfusion was expressed 3 fold less than the ydcI::lacZconstruct (Fig. 3B). We introduced a plasmid expressing theS. TyphimuriumydcIgene from an arabinose inducible promoter (pBAD18+ydcI) into the ydcI::lacZmutant strain. In the presence of arabinose, this strain expressed significantly lesslacZthan the control strain containing the vector only (Fig. 3B). Collectively, these results indicate that the YdcI protein negatively autoregulates its expression under the conditions tested here and is expressed at relatively low levels when this autoregulation is intact.\n\nRT PCR ofydcIgene homologs in a range of Gram negative genera. The plus and minus lanes contain samples with and without reverse transcriptase, respectively. The Ch lane contains samples where chromosomal DNA isolated from the indicated strain was used in the PCR. NCR refers to a noncoding region in theS. Typhimurium genome between two divergent promoters that is not predicted to be transcribed.\n\nAnalysis ofydcI::lacZfusions inS. Typhimurium. (A) A promoterlesslacZgene was transcriptionally fused to the WT and ydcImutant alleles of theS. TyphimuriumydcIgene in separate strains. The maps of the WT, ydcI::lacZ, and WTydcI::lacZgene loci in theS. Typhimurium strain genomes are shown. (B) The LacZ activity of the strains in panel A is shown. In addition, the ydcI::lacZstrain was transformed with either pBAD18 or pBAD18+ydcIand assayed for LacZ activity in the presence or absence of arabinose.\n\nTo test the YdcI protein for DNA binding activity, we cloned theS. TyphimuriumydcIgene downstream of an arabinose inducible promoter on the plasmid vector pBAD18 (24). In this construct, we also fused the coding sequence for a six histidine epitope immediately after the last codon such that the YdcI protein would be expressed with a C terminal tag. Arabinose dependent expression of the YdcI protein was demonstrated via Western blot analysis, and we then purified the fusion protein using nickel agarose columns (see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material). To test the DNA binding activity of YdcI, we incubated YdcI protein from either cell extracts or purified preparations with a 180 bp DNA probe (named H3) consisting of the sequence immediately upstream of theS. TyphimuriumydcIORF as indicated in Materials and Methods. Both sources of YdcI protein shifted the labeled H3 probe in this assay (Fig. 4A). To test the specificity of the YdcI DNA binding activity, we used a 152 bp probe consisting oflacZgene DNA, and YdcI did not shift this probe (Fig. 4B). In addition, we also synthesized a 182 bp probe (named H5) consisting of DNA from theydcIpromoter region that extends immediately upstream of the H3 probe and show that YdcI does not shift this probe (Fig. 4B). We also incubated gel shift reaction mixtures with an excess of unlabeledydcIpromoter fragment H3 (specific competitor) or unlabeledlacZfragment (nonspecific competitor). The results are consistent with a specific YdcI DNA binding activity since the specific competitor abolished binding to the probe and the nonspecific competitor did not (Fig. 4C). Since YdcI is a DNA binding protein that has not been previously characterized, we used the gel shift assay to determine an apparent dissociation constant (KD) for the YdcI binding activity. The concentration of YdcI protein at which 50% binding occurred (and thus indicated the apparentKDunder these conditions) was approximately 2.3 to 4.6 nM (see Fig. S4 in the supplemental material). This magnitude of apparentKDis consistent with documented specific DNA binding activity of members of this protein family (34,44,47) and is consistent with the conclusion that theydcIgene encodes a specific DNA binding protein.\n\nGel shift assays with YdcI protein. (A) The labeled H3 DNA probe from theS. TyphimuriumydcIpromoter region was incubated with YdcI cell extracts or purified YdcI protein and run in an 8% acrylamide TBE gel. Lanes: 1, probe alone; 2, TOP10(pBAD18+ydcI) extract, 300 ng; 3, TOP10(pBAD18) extract, 300 ng; 4, purified YdcI protein, approximately 10 nM. (B) Gel shift reaction mixtures with different probes incubated with purified YdcI protein. Lanes: 1, H5 probe alone; 2, H5 probe plus YdcI; 3, H3 probe alone; 4, H3 probe plus YdcI; 5,lacZprobe alone; 6,lacZprobe plus YdcI. (C) YdcI gel shift reaction mixtures with labeled H3 probe were incubated with unlabeled specific (H3 DNA fragment) or nonspecific (lacZDNA fragment) competitor DNA and then run in an 8% acrylamide gel. Lanes: 1, probe alone; 2, no competitor; 3 to 5, specific competitor at 135x, 270x, and 540x molar excesses, respectively; 6 to 8, nonspecific competitor at 135x, 270x, and 540x molar excesses, respectively.\n\nSince our results indicated that a YdcI DNA binding site is located within the H3 probe, we used the Microfootprinter program (http://bio.cs.washington.edu/MicroFootPrinter.html) to identify possible YdcI binding sites within the H3 fragment (37). This analysis yielded two candidate sites in the H3 fragment, but two separate 40 bp probes containing each site did not display binding to YdcI protein in the gel shift assay (data not shown).\n\nIn order to study the role of theydcIgene inSalmonellabiology, we constructed a knockout mutation of theydcIgene in the chromosome ofS. Typhimurium using the lambda Red recombination system (see Materials and Methods for details). We observed no significant growth differences between the WT and ydcImutant strains using OD600and CFU measurements in a growth curve (see Fig. S5 in the supplemental material). Since theydcIgene was initially brought to our attention as a member of a stimulon of genes that change expression under conditions that alter bacterial stress resistance, we tested theydcImutant for osmotic, thermal, oxidative, and acid stress resistance compared to that of the isogenic WT strain. Under conditions of osmotic and thermal stress, we did not observe a significant difference in survival between the WT and ydcImutant strains (Fig. 5). Under conditions of oxidative stress, we observed inconsistent results that may indicate a survival defect under these conditions of the ydcImutant compared to the WT, but this experiment requires further study to determine a conclusive effect (data not shown). However, under both organic (citric acid) and inorganic (HCl) acid stress (pH 3.5), we observed a significant difference between the survival of the ydcImutant and that of the WT strain (Fig. 5). Both the organic and inorganic acid resistance defects can be complemented by a functional copy ofydcIprovided on a plasmid (Fig. 5). These data indicate that theydcIgene is required for full acid stress resistance ofS. Typhimurium under the conditions studied here and likely expresses a protein that serves to regulate genes involved in acid stress resistance.\n\nAcid resistance defect inS. Typhimurium ydcImutant. Isogenic WT and ydcI S. Typhimurium strains were tested for resistance to osmotic (2.5 M NaCl), thermal (50 degreesC), and acid (pH 3.5 using citric acid or HCl) stress over a time period of 120 min. The percent survival of the WT and ydcImutant strains under the corresponding stress (compared to before addition of stress) was calculated, and a ratio of the percent survival of the indicated ydcImutant test strain to that of the WT strain is shown. The ydcImutant strain containing pBAD18 or pBAD18+ydcIwas grown in the presence of arabinose.\n\nTheS. TyphimuriumrpoSgene encodes a highly conserved sigma factor that is required for the expression of a wide array of genes involved in resistance to a range of environmental stresses and has been termed the \"master regulator\" of bacterial stress resistance (16,26,29). Since theydcIgene is required for full acid stress resistance ofS. Typhimurium, we compared the phenotype of anS. Typhimurium ydcIrpoSdouble mutant to that of the ydcIand rpoSsingle mutants to distinguish between the possibilities thatydcIandrpoSare part of the same pathway or part of separate, additive pathways. In the citric acid resistance assay, we observed that the rpoSmutant displayed high sensitivity within 30 min, but the ydcImutant did not display its sensitivity until 120 min after the addition of stress (Fig. 5andFig. 6A). Thus, within 30 min of citric acid stress exposure, the ydcIand WT strains display similar phenotypes (Fig. 6A). However, the ydcIrpoSdouble mutant displayed a citric acid resistance defect that was identical to that of the rpoSsingle mutant (Fig. 6A). In the HCl acid resistance assay, both the ydcIand rpoSsingle mutants display high sensitivity within 30 min of acid exposure, but the rpoSmutant is significantly more sensitive than the ydcImutant during this time (Fig. 6A). The ydcIrpoSdouble mutant displayed an HCl acid resistance defect identical to that of the rpoSsingle mutant. These results suggest that theydcIandrpoSgenes act via the same pathway and do not act in an additive manner in separate pathways to provide WT levels of acid resistance.\n\nRelationship betweenydcIandrpoSgenes. (A) The indicated strains were subjected to acid stress (pH 3.5) with citric acid or HCl as indicated over a 30 min time period. The percent survival of the strains (compared to before the addition of stress) was calculated, and a ratio of the percent survival of the test strain to the WT strain is shown. Note that the phenotype of the ydcImutant is similar to the WT for citric acid stress within 30 min (the data inFig. 5are from 120 min of acid stress). ThePvalues were calculated as comparisons of the indicated strains and the ydcIsingle mutant strain. (B) Cultures of the indicated strains were assayed for LacZ activity and plotted for Miller units. All strains are in the 3339 background, as indicated inTable 1. Cm::lacZindicates that thelacZgene in this strain is transcribed via the Cmrgene promoter. STM2901::Cm indicates the gene location of a Cmrmarker linked to the WTrpoSgene within approximately 20 kb of DNA in theS. Typhimurium genome.\n\nTo test ifrpoSplays a role in the expression of theydcIgene, we constructed a WTydcI::lacZrpoSstrain and compared the LacZ activity of this strain to that of the WTydcI::lacZstrain. Remarkably, the WTydcI::lacZrpoSstrain completely lost LacZ activity, in contrast to the control (Fig. 6B). A control strain in which the samelacZreporter gene was driven by the Cmr encoding gene promoter was not affected by the presence of the rpoSmutation (Fig. 6B). To demonstrate that the loss of WTydcI::lacZactivity was not due to a random artifact of strain construction, we restored the WTrpoSallele to the WTydcI::lacZrpoSstrain using P22 transduction of a Cmrmarker linked to the WTrpoSallele as described in Materials and Methods. This strain displayed WT levels of WTydcI::lacZactivity, in contrast to the control, confirming that the rpoSmutation was responsible for the expression defect (Fig. 6B). Taken together, the double mutant studies andlacZreporter analysis provide significant evidence that theydcIgene is part of therpoSregulon inS. Typhimurium.\n\nTo test for a role forydcIinS. Typhimurium invasion of cultured intestinal epithelial cells, we compared the ydcImutant strain to the WT for entry into Int407 cells. The results indicated that the ydcImutant did not differ significantly from the WT in Int407 invasion (Fig. 7A). However, we also tested the invasion phenotype of strains in whichydcIexpression had been induced or \"turned on\" as an alternative to analysis of the deletion mutant (in which the gene is removed). Since expression of theydcIgene from the pBAD18+ydcIconstruct restored the repression of a chromosomal ydcI::lacZfusion to WT levels, expressed a protein displaying specific DNA binding activity as predicted, and complemented the ydcIacid resistance defect back to WT levels, we reasoned that this construct would be an appropriate reagent for this purpose. WT strain 3339 containing pBAD18+ydcIinvaded Int407 cells to a level 2.8 times higher than that of controls in the presence of arabinose (Fig. 7A). Control strains containing the pBAD18 vector alone or pBAD18+lacZdid not display increased cell entry in either the presence or the absence of arabinose (Fig. 7A). The latter strain expresses copious amounts of LacZ protein (several thousand Miller units) in the presence of arabinose (reference42and data not shown). This indicates that this phenotype is specific toydcIinduction and not merely due to general overexpression of protein in this strain. The pBAD18 and pBAD18+ydcIstrains displayed virtually identical levels of adherence to Int407 cells under these conditions (see Fig. S6 in the supplemental material). The SPI 1 genes encode a type III secretion system used to facilitate invasion of nonphagocytic cells like those of the Int407 line (18 20). To test if induction ofydcIcould serve to reverse the invasion defect of the SPI 1 strain, we introduced the pBAD18+ydcIplasmid into this strain, inducedydcIexpression via arabinose, and tested invasion of the culture. We did not observe any reversal of the SPI 1 invasion defect under these conditions compared to the control strain containing the vector alone (Fig. 7A). This may suggest that the increased invasion uponydcIinduction in the WT strain background occurs via the SPI 1 pathway.\n\nWe also tested if the ydcImutation or induction ofydcIexpression had any effect onS. Typhimurium survival in J774 macrophages. Neither the deletion nor the induction of theydcIgene had any effect onS. Typhimurium macrophage survival (Fig. 7B).\n\nWhen cultures of strain 3339 containing pBAD18 or pBAD18+ydcIwere supplemented with arabinose and allowed to grow for approximately 12 to 16 h postsupplementation, we observed that the strain containing pBAD18+ydcIformed a biofilm which was especially prominent at the medium air interface (Fig. 8A). This biofilm was readily stained with crystal violet, indicating significant cell adhesion (Fig. 8A), and this observation was confirmed via microscopy (data not shown). Biofilm staining was readily observed in areas below the medium air interface, suggesting that biofilm mediated adhesion was not dependent on the interface (Fig. 8A). The control strain containing pBAD18 did not form a biofilm after arabinose supplementation (Fig. 8A). In addition, both strains did not form a biofilm under the same growth conditions in the absence of arabinose (data not shown). To confirm that biofilm formation was not the result of general protein expression from the pBAD18 arabinose inducible promoter, we performed the same assay with strain 3339 containing pBAD18+lacZ. This strain had a phenotype identical to that of the pBAD18 control and did not form a biofilm upon arabinose supplementation (Fig. 8B). Quantitation of crystal violet staining of the biofilm confirmed the qualitative differences observed between the strains inFig. 8(see Fig. S7 in the supplemental material).\n\nInduction ofydcIexpression results inS. Typhimurium biofilm formation. (A)S. Typhimurium strain 3339 containing either pBAD18 or pBAD18+ydcIwas grown in the presence of arabinose for approximately 16 h in LB medium. The white arrow indicates significant biofilm accumulation at the medium air interface. The upper and lower panels show culture appearance and crystal violet stained flasks (with cultures removed), respectively. (B) The same as panel A, except that strain 3339 containing pBAD18+lacZwas tested.\n\nTo test if theydcIgene plays a role in transmission of the low fluid shear environmental signal inS. Typhimurium, we tested both the WT and ydcImutant strains for two separate phenotypes induced by low fluid shear growth in the RWV apparatus. Previous studies have established that low fluid shear conditions alter the acid and oxidative stress resistance profiles of WTS. Typhimurium (39,41,52 55). We grew cultures of the WT and ydcImutant strains under low fluid shear and control conditions in the RWV and subjected these cultures to separate acid (pH 3.5 using citric acid) and oxidative (70 mM H2O2) stresses. In both tests, the ydcImutant strain displayed the same low fluid shear induced phenotype as the WT strain (Fig. 9). This indicates that theydcIgene is not required for these low fluid shear responses inS. Typhimurium under these conditions.\n\nLow fluid shear phenotypes of WT and ydcImutant strains via RWV culture. TheS. Typhimurium WT and ydcImutant strains were grown in the RWV apparatus in low fluid shear (LFS) or control conditions, and the cultures were tested for acid stress resistance (pH 3.5 with citric acid) or oxidative stress resistance (70 mM H2O2) in separate assays. The percent survival of the WT and ydcImutant strains for each culture condition in each stress was calculated, and a ratio of the percent survival of each sample to the control condition for each stress is shown. Low fluid shear culture alters stress resistance compared to the control for both the WT and ydcImutant strains.",
    "discussion": "Growth conditions such as spaceflight and RWV culture that are characterized by low fluid shear force have been shown to increase bacterial virulence (39,52,53). In addition, an array of other phenotypes is induced or altered via this growth environment (6,7,40,41). Interestingly, these fluid shear levels are relevant to those encountered by certain pathogens in the human host during the course of infection (23,36,40,41). However, this environmental cue is not well characterized, and a number of uncharacterized genes with unknown function are part of a stimulon associated with low fluid shear force (7,52,53,55). Unexplored genes with potentially important, observable roles in prokaryotic biology could be part of this stimulon, but they may not have been previously analyzed because they have not been identified as part of any established regulatory networks or phenotypes. One such gene,S. TyphimuriumydcI, was discovered to be a member of theS. Typhimurium low fluid shear stimulon and has been predicted be homologous to the LysR family of transcriptional regulators (54,55). However, theydcIgene was previously uncharacterized before this study.\n\nThe goals of this study were to characterize theS. TyphimuriumydcIgene for a role in bacterial biology and to analyze the DNA binding activity of the YdcI protein. In this report, we demonstrate that theydcIgene (i) is conserved in a range of Gram negative bacteria, (ii) is expressed inS. Typhimurium and other Gram negative species, (iii) is autorepressed inS. Typhimurium, (iv) encodes a DNA binding protein that binds specifically to a probe from theydcIpromoter, (v) is required for full resistance ofS. Typhimurium to acid stress, (vi) is part of therpoSregulon, (vii) can increaseS. Typhimurium invasion of intestinal epithelial cells when induced, and (viii) can cause biofilm formation inS. Typhimurium when induced. These results indicate that theydcIgene likely serves as a DNA binding transcriptional regulator that regulates genes involved in aspects of bacterial biology, including stress resistance and possibly virulence. A major goal in the future study ofydcIwill be to identify the genes that are members of a potential \"YdcI regulon\" to understand how genes regulated by YdcI are linked to stress resistance, host cell interactions, biofilm formation, and other prokaryotic functions. In addition, future studies will focus on determining ifydcIhas a role in the transmission of the low fluid shear environmental cue to bacterial cells beyond the experiments performed here. Though the results ofFig. 9show that theydcIgene is not required for the low fluid shear phenotypes tested as part of this study, this gene may be involved in other low fluid shear responses not yet tested (including in other species beyondS. Typhimurium).\n\nExpression of theydcIgene is upregulated by low fluid shear growth conditions (54,55). Interestingly, though theydcIgene is clearly expressed in bacteria under \"standard\" culture conditions, theS. TyphimuriumydcIgene appears to be repressed and expressed at relatively low levels under these conditions. One intriguing possibility is thatydcIis expressed at a certain level under one set of conditions and is then upregulated by an environmental signal(s) to induce adaptive cellular changes for another set of conditions. As indicated by our data, these changes could include altering resistance to stresses, interactions with host cells, or physiology related to biofilm formation. Whether these changes function to adaptS. Typhimurium or other bacteria for their roles as pathogens remains to be determined with future studies. However, our data suggest that, at a minimum, theydcIgene likely regulates genes with the potential for involvement in functions related to stress resistance, growth/survival, and possibly virulence. The observation thatydcIexpression involves the RpoS sigma factor provides support to this hypothesis since RpoS controls the expression of a regulon of genes involved in stress resistance and virulence (16,26,29,38). However, we have previously reported that RpoS is not required for a range of low fluid shear responses inS. Typhimurium (54). Therefore, a possible scheme for the regulation ofydcIexpression is that RpoS is used for expression under certain conditions and another (yet to be identified) pathway is used for expression under other conditions (such as low fluid shear). Future studies will be aimed at determining howydcIgene regulation fits into regulatory schemes in a range of bacteria.\n\nThis is the first report to demonstrate DNA binding activity of the YdcI protein. We show that both (i) extracts containing YdcI protein and (ii) purified YdcI protein are able to bind a DNA probe (from theS. TyphimuriumydcIpromoter region) in a specific manner. The YdcI DNA binding activity displays an apparent dissociation constant with a value consistent with specific DNA binding proteins with biologic functions and consistent with other members of LysR family (to which YdcI belongs) (34,44,47). Induced expression of the YdcI protein repressed anS. TyphimuriumydcI::lacZfusion and complemented the acid resistance defect of anS. Typhimurium ydcImutant. These observations suggest that the YdcI DNA binding activity functions in bacterial cells to affect physiological changes. Future studies will be aimed at determining (i) the specific DNA site that is recognized by YdcI, (ii) the genes associated with YdcI binding sites, and (iii) whether these sites are used by YdcI in other bacterial species. We identified potential binding sites within the H3 probe fragment, but smaller DNA fragments containing these individual sites did not display YdcI binding activity. Identification of the actual YdcI binding site will require additional, systematic study that is beyond the scope of this report. However, this report provides a foundation for analyzing the previously uncharacterized YdcI DNA binding activity via a number of approaches.\n\nThough inducedydcIexpression affectsS. Typhimurium intestinal epithelial cell invasion and biofilm formation, we do not know how the YdcI protein functions in these phenotypes. We demonstrate that the host cell interaction phenotype only affects the invasion of intestinal epithelial cells and not survival in macrophages. One possibility for this may be thatydcIcan alter the expression of genes involved in SPI 1 type III secretion mediated invasion of nonphagocytic cells or other genes involved in specific interactions with epithelial cells. Indeed, the induction ofydcIdid not increase invasion by a SPI 1 strain, suggesting thatydcIpossibly acts through the SPI 1 pathway for increased invasion. We tested a SPI 1invI::lacZfusion for altered expression in the presence of pBAD18+ydcIand found thatydcIinduction produced a 7.1 fold decrease in reporter expression (data not shown). This indicates that YdcI may potentially alter SPI 1 gene expression as part of its function, but how YdcI would do this in the context of the many different SPI 1 genes and the other regulators of SPI 1 gene expression remains to be determined. Systematic identification of the genes regulated by YdcI and elucidation of how YdcI controls these genes as part of an overall regulatory scheme will require further controlled study. Biofilm formation inSalmonellaspp. appears to be a complex process and has been shown to involve a number of different genes involved in flagella and curli fiber formation, cellulose production, and O antigen synthesis (8,9,27,28,31). In addition, there are likely at least two different types of biofilms formed bySalmonellaspp. that are utilized on either cholesterol rich surfaces (like gallstones) or on material surfaces like glass or plastic (8,9). We do not know howydcIaffectsSalmonellagenes involved in biofilm formation, but studies aimed at determining the nature of theydcI induced biofilm and the genes involved in this process are currently being pursued.",
