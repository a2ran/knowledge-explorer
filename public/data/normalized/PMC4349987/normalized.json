    "abstract": "To understand the early signaling steps in the response of plant cells to increased environmental temperature, 2 D difference gel electrophoresis was used to study the proteins in microsomes ofArabidopsisseedlings that are regulated early during heat stress. Using mass spectrometry, 19 microsomal proteins that showed an altered expression level within 5 min after heat treatment were identified. Among these proteins, annexin 1 (AtANN1) was one of those up regulated rapidly after heat shock treatment. Functional studies show loss of function mutants forAtANN1and its close homologAtANN2were more sensitive to heat shock treatment, whereas plants overexpressingAtANN1showed more resistance to this treatment. Correspondingly, the heat induced expression of heat shock proteins and heat shock factors is inhibited inann1/ann2double mutant, and the heat activated increase in cytoplasmic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]cyt) is greatly impaired in theann1mutant and almost undetectable inann1/ann2double mutant. Taken together these results suggest that AtANN1 is important in regulating the heat induced increase in [Ca2+]cytand in the response ofArabidopsisseedlings to heat stress.",
    "methods": "Arabidopsis thalianaseeds were surface sterilized using 75% (v/v) ethanol and sowed in glass plates containing 25 ml growth medium containing half strength Murashige and Skoog (1/2 MS) salt, 1.5% (w/v) sucrose, and 0.8% (w/v) agar. Plates were stratified at 4  degreesC in darkness for 3 days. Seedlings were allowed to grow at 22  degreesC under long day conditions (16 h light/8 h dark) for 1 week. For heat shock treatment, the glass plates were wrapped with general kitchen plastic wrap and submerged in a water bath at the indicated temperature for different periods. The seedlings were returned to 22  degreesC under long day to recover for 1 week before taking pictures for analysis. All the data showed in this study has been performed at least three times with similar results. Representative data from one repetition are shown in the figures.\n\nBecause we were interested in finding heat shock regulated proteins whose level changed rapidly, we used a water bath for our heat shock proteomic studies to make sure all the seedlings were instantly subjected to similar temperature at same time. To prepare the seedlings for 2D DIGE protein sample extraction,Arabidopsisseedlings were grown in liquid medium containing 1/2 MS salt and 1.5% (w/v) sucrose under long day at 22  degreesC for 1 week. To avoid a nutrient shock effect, half of the old medium was transferred into a new container and incubated at 37  degreesC in the water bath, whereas the other half of the medium was kept at 22  degreesC with the seedlings. When the temperature of the water bath medium reached 37  degreesC, half of the seedlings were transferred into the medium to initiate the heat shock treatment. After heat shock treatment for 5 min, seedlings were harvested by filtering through a nylon mesh, quick tap dried with tissue paper and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Microsomal proteins were extracted as described previously (16), and dissolved in DIGE buffer (7murea, 2mthiourea, 4% CHAPS) at a concentration around 5 10 ug/ul.\n\nProtein for 2D DIGE analysis was labeled with CyDyeTMDIGE fluor minimal labeling kit (GE Healthcare). In brief, 10 ul microsomal protein from control or heat treated sample was mixed with 0.25 ul of Tris HCl (1.5m, pH 8.8) and 0.5 ul of 100 nmCy3 or Cy5, respectively, and incubated in darkness at 4  degreesC for 2 h. The reaction was terminated by adding 1 ul 10 mmlysine and incubating with the protein on ice for 10 min. The Cy3  and Cy5  labeled pair of control and heat treated samples were combined, and to the mix was added 9 ul of 1mDTT, 4.5 ul of IPG buffer, pH 4 7. One hundred micrograms of unlabeled protein each from control and heat treated samples was then added to make the total protein amount in the mixture around 300 ug. The DIGE buffer was used to adjust the final volume to 450 ul for separation by isoelectric focusing (IEF) using 24 cm Immobiline Dry Strips, pH 4 7. Two dimensional electrophoresis was performed according to (16). DIGE images were acquired using a Typhoon trio scanner (GE healthcare). At least six biological repeats were performed, and labeling of two pairs of biological repeat samples was swapped to avoid identifying proteins that are preferentially labeled by a specific CyDye. Spots that showed consistent heat shock regulated changes in at least five biological repeat samples were picked using a robotic spot picker (GE healthcare).\n\nProtein in gel digestion was performed as described previously (17). Extracted peptides in 0.1% formic acid were separated using a 100 um x150 mm C18 reverse phase column (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at a flow rate of 350 nl/min, and eluted using a linear acetonitrile (ACN) gradient (0 45%) with 0.1% formic acid over 60 min using a nano LC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Eluted peptides were electrosprayed directly into a LTQ XL linear ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using an uncoated 15 um inner diameter spraying needle with 2.1 kV electrospray voltage at 220  degreesC. Peptides were analyzed in positive ion mode with m/z range between 400 and 2000. Charged peaks over 1000 counts were selected for collision induced dissociation (CID) with 35% normalized collision energy and activation Q value was set to 0.25. The dynamic exclusion activation time was set to 30 s to prevent samem/zions from being selected after its acquisition. CID product ions were analyzed on the linear ion trap in centroid mode.\n\nComplete LC MS/MS peak lists were searched against database generated fromArabidopsissubset of the NCBInr database (date 12/12/2012, 257,035 entries searched), using the SEQUEST search algorithm, which is part of the BioWorks 3.3.1 data analysis software (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The peptide mass range was set to 400 5000 amu. The precursor ions' tolerance and fragment ions' tolerance were set to 2.00 amu and 1.00 amu, respectively. Enzymatic digestion was specified as trypsin, with a maximum of two missed cleavages allowed. Cysteine carbamidomethylation was allowed as fixed modifications, and methionine oxidation were allowed as variable modification. Search result option filter was set as the following: Delta CN >= 0.1; Xcorr (+/ 1, 2, 3) = 1.75, 2.5, 3.0; peptide probability<=0.01.\n\nT DNA insertional mutant forAtANN1(SALK_132169, SAIK_414_C01, WiscDsLox477 480P11),AtANN2(SALK_054223) andAtANN6(SALK_112492) were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (http://www.arabidopsis.org), and are all in Columbia (Col 0) background. The identifiedann1 2mutant was used to cross withann2mutant. F3 segregatedann1 2/ann2double homozygous mutant were used for heat stress tolerance analysis. The gene specific primers used for genotyping the mutants were: 5 gcctgcttcagcttttgtatg 3 (left) and 5 aacgctaccgacacaacattc 3 (right) for SALK_132169; 5 tgctccttctgatgatgctg 3 (left) and 5 ccaataaagcatcacgctca 3 (right) for SAIL_414_C01; 5 tggactcttgatccaccaga 3 (left) and 5 gagcaacaagcatgtcctca 3 (right) for SALK_054223; 5 ggcgtctctcaaaattccag 3 (left) and 5 caccagaaagctctccgtct 3 (right) for SALK_112492. The transcript abundance ofAtANN1andAtANN2in wild type and mutant seedlings was determined by semi quantitative Reverse transcription PCR using 5 atggcgactcttaaggtttc 3 (left) and 5 agcatcatcttcaccgagaag 3 (right) forAtANN1and gene specific genotyping primer set for SALK_054223 and SALK_112492.\n\nFull length CDS ofAtANN1were amplified by PCR, cloned into pENTR/SD/D TOPO vector (Invitrogen), and subcloned into Gateway compatible binary vector pEarleyGate 100 by LR clonase (Invitrogen). The construct was introduced intoAgrobacterium tumefaciensstrain GV3101 by electroporation and transformed intoArabidopsis(Col 0 ecotype) by the floral dipping method. Transgenic plants were selected by spraying plants with 5 ug/ml Basta (Finale). All transgenic lines used in this study are single insertional homozygous T3 lines.\n\nWild type andann1 2/ann2double mutant seedlings were grown in the same glass plates containing 15 ml growth medium (1/2 MS salt, 1.5% sucrose, and 0.8% agar) for 1 week at 22  degreesC under long day condition. For heat shock treatment, the plates were placed into a growth chamber with temperature set at 37  degreesC. Seedlings were harvested at different time intervals and frozen in liquid nitrogen. For RT PCR analysis of the expression level of various HSFs transcript, total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and reverse transcribed into cDNA using ExScriptTMRT reagent kit (Takara) according to manufacturer's instruction. Primer pairs used for RT PCR analysis were: 5 atgatgaacccgtttctcccggaag 3 and 5 ggaggtggaagccaaactctcatcac 3 for HSF A7A; 5 atggaagaactgaaagtggaaat 3 and 5 aggttccgaaccaagaaaacccatt 3 for HSF A2; 5 atgacggctgtgacggcggcgcaaag 3 and 5 gttgcagactttgctgcttttccac 3 for HSF B1; 5 acagatttcgctaaagatttgctt 3 and 5 cgcttcttcttcttcttcaatctc 3 for HSF B2A. For protein abundance analysis of HSPs, frozen tissues were ground into fine powder in liquid nitrogen, boiled with 2x SDS sampling buffer, loaded onto SDS PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. Membrane was probed with different antibodies specifically against various HSPs (Agrisera, Vnns, Sweden) and detected with SuperSignal West Dura Chemiluminescence System (Pierce).\n\nAequorin luminescence measurement was performed according to (18), with slight modifications. TransgenicArabidopsisseedlings expressing cytosolic35S::Aequorinwere grown in 1/2 MS salt containing medium for 10 days under long day at 22  degreesC. Seedlings (n >= 15 per treatment) were transferred to a 96 well plate and incubated in dark with a calcium measurement buffer (0.1 mmKCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 10 mmMES, 5 umcoelenterazine h) at 22  degreesC for 6 h. The seedlings were quick rinsed two times with the calcium measurement buffer, 100 ul 22  degreesC (control) or 37  degreesC (heat shock) calcium measurement buffer was quickly added to each well, and the plate was loaded into a microplate luminometer (Centro LB 960, Berthold, Oak Ridge, TN) that is at room temperature (control) or has been prewarmed to 37  degreesC (heat shock). Aequorin luminescence signal in each well was recorded for 0.5 s every 30 s. After 45 counts, 100 ul reconstitution solution (2mCaCl2, 20% ethanol) was injected and luminescence signal in each well was recorded for 10 more cycles, 0.5 s each. Percentage reconstitution value was calculated by dividing the luminescence signal recorded at each time point by the highest reconstitution luminescence value recorded in each well, respectively, for wild type,ann1andann1/2mutants. Relative aequorin signal is calculated by dividing percentage reconstitution value collected at 37  degreesC by percentage reconstitution value collected at 22  degreesC.\n\nFifty seven day oldArabidopsisseedlings grown in 1/2 MS medium supplied with 1% sucrose were grouped as one sample and oven dried at 65  degreesC overnight. After recording the dry weights, the dried plants were digested with 5 ml HNO3 at 100  degreesC for 4 h. The digested mixture was transferred to a volumetric flask, and diluted precisely to 100 ml with double distilled water. Total plant Ca2+concentration was determined with a flame atomic absorption spectrophotomer (Model AA 240Z, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).",
    "results": "Increased environmental temperature triggers heat shock responses (HSR) in plants; however, if the temperature rises above a certain limit, or the duration of the high temperature is too long, plants will not be able to survive. To study the HS response of plant cells, the treatment used should be strong enough to stimulate the HSR, but at the same time mild enough not to kill the plant. In order to find a proper heat shock treatment condition for our proteomic studies, plates containing one week oldArabidopsisseedlings were treated at a range of temperatures and treatment durations, and post treatment survival rates were calculated after the seedlings recovered at 22  degreesC for 1 week. Treatment ofArabidopsisseedlings in a 42  degreesC water bath up to 10 min did not induce irreversible damage to seedlings, whereas treatment with a 42  degreesC water bath for 30 min killed almost all of the seedlings. In comparison, seedlings treated with a 37  degreesC water bath for 30 min survived (Fig. 1). As 37  degreesC has been previously shown to induce HSR (9,11,12), a 37  degreesC water bath was used as our treatment temperature during the following proteomic studies.\n\nThe effect of heat shock temperature and duration on the survival ofArabidopsisseedlings.One week oldArabidopsisseedlings were heat shock treated at different temperatures for the indicated time period and allowed to recover at 22  degreesC for 7 days before taking pictures for comparison.\n\nHeat shock stimulates a rapid increase of the [Ca2+]cyt. This increase can be seen as early as 1 min after heat treatment, and reaches the maximum around 5 mins (11). In order to study the early cellular responses stimulated by HS, we exposed one week oldArabidopsisseedlings to 37  degreesC for 5 mins and harvested them for 2D DIGE analysis.\n\nProtein samples from control and treated seedlings were analyzed in at least six biological repeat experiments. In average, over 1500 protein spots were detected in each gel (Fig. 2A). Examination of the DIGE images identified over 49 spots that showed consistent abundance changes induced by heat shock. Surprisingly, the abundance of most spots was increased by heat treatment, and only a few showed decreased levels. These spots of interest were picked, digested in gel by trypsin and analyzed by LC MS/MS. A total of 27 heat shock regulated protein spots, which represented 19 unique proteins, were successfully identified (Table I). Functional classification showed these proteins are involved in processes such as hormone biosynthesis, protein translation, calcium signaling, cellular metabolism, and protein folding (chaperone).\n\n2D DIGE analysis of heat regulated microsomal proteins identified AtANN1 as an early heat responsive protein.A, Microsomal protein from Col 0 seedlings treated with 37  degreesC for 5 min was labeled with Cy5, and microsomal protein from untreated seedlings was labeled with Cy3. The proteins were then separated using 24 cm, pH 4 7, IPG strips and a 10% SDS PAGE gel.B, Three dimensional view of spot 4191 in imageA, left image represents Cy3 channel and right image represents Cy5 channel.C, Western analysis of AtANN1 protein accumulation after heat shock. One week old seedlings were heat shock (37  degreesC) treated for the indicated time, microsomal proteins were extracted and separated by SDS PAGE. Upper panel shows AtANN1 protein was detected by polyclonal antibodies raised specifically against AtANN1, lower panel shows Ponceau S stained rubisco large subunit as the equal loading control.\n\nOf all the microsomal proteins identified inTable I, we chose to further study AtANN1 (Fig. 2B), because of prior evidence showing that it could play a major role in mediating plant stress responses. Using polyclonal antibody raised specific against a 31 amino acid sequence from AtANN1 (amino acids 200 231) (19), we confirmed the 2D DIGE result in which AtANN1 protein levels increased in the microsomal fraction after 5 mins of HS (Fig. 2C). We then isolated Transfer DNA (T DNA) insertion mutants ofAtANN1gene to investigate ifAtANN1plays a significant role in HS responses inArabidopsis. We obtained three insertion mutants forAtANN1, and these alleles were named asann1 1(SalK_132169),ann1 2(Sail_414_C01), andann1 3(WiscDsLox477 480P11;Fig. 3A). The T DNA insertion sites in these alleles were located at the 5 UTR of theAtANN1gene (ann1 1) or within different positions of its second and third exon (ann1 2andann1 3), respectively (Fig. 3A). Reverse transcription PCR (RT PCR) analysis of these T DNA mutants showed that the expression ofAtANN1inann1 2andann1 3is not detectable, whereas the expression ofAtANN1inann1 1was not affected (Fig. 3B). We then compared the basal thermotolerance of these T DNA insertional mutants with wild type seedlings. One week old seedlings were subjected to 45  degreesC water bath for 13 min, and then allowed to recover at 22  degreesC for another week before they were photographed and calculate their survival rate. Consistent with the expression of endogenousAtANN1level,ann1 2andann1 3seedlings were hypersensitive to heat shock treatment, whereas heat sensitivity ofann1 1seedlings was similar to wild type plants (Fig. 3C,3D).\n\nAtANN1is essential for plant resistance to heat shock treatment.A, Diagram shows the T DNA insertion positions for differentAtANN1T DNA mutants.B, RT PCR analysis ofAtANN1expression level in differentann1T DNA mutants.C, The response of differentann1T DNA mutants to heat shock treatment. Seven day old seedlings grown on 1/2 MS plates at 22  degreesC were shifted to a 45  degreesC water bath for 13 min and then returned to 22  degreesC and allowed to recover for 1 week before taking photos. Scale bar represents 1 cm.D, Quantification of survival rate of seedlings shown inC. Data represent the mean value from five independent experiments, with 25 seedlings per experiment. One way ANOVA test was performed. Statistically significant differences are indicated by different lowercase letters (p< 0.05). Error bars represent +/ S.D.\n\nThere are eight members of theArabidopsisannexin gene family. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that AtANN1, AtANN2, and AtANN6 are all closely related, with AtANN2 and AtANN6 having 75% identity at the amino acid level (20). There is expression and immunolocalization evidence suggesting that AtANN1 and AtANN2 have both distinct and overlapping functions inArabidopsis(21,22). To investigate if other annexins also participate in plant HS responses, we isolated T DNA insertion mutants forAtANN2andAtANN6and tested basal thermotolerance of the mutant seedlings (Fig. 4A,4B). The sensitivity ofann2mutants to heat shock treatment is higher than wild type but lower thanann1 2mutants (Fig. 4C). In contrast, knocking out the expression ofAtANN6did not alter the sensitivity of the mutant to heat shock treatment (Fig. 4C). We then generated anann1 2/ann2double mutant by crossingann2withann1 2, and found theann1 2/ann2double mutant seedlings were more sensitive to heat stress treatment than theann1 2single mutants. These results indicatedAtANN1andAtANN2, but notAtANN6, play redundant roles in regulating plant heat shock responses.\n\nAtANN1andAtANN2play redundant roles in regulating plant heat shock responses.A, Diagram shows the T DNA insertion position forann2(SALK_054223) andann6(SALK_112492) T DNA mutants.B, RT PCR analysis ofAtANN2andAtANN6expression level inann2andann6T DNA mutants.C, The response ofann1 2,ann2,ann6, andann1 2/ann2double T DNA mutant (ann1/2) to heat shock treatment. Seven day old seedlings grown on 1/2 MS plates at 22  degreesC were shifted to a 45  degreesC water bath for 13 min and then returned to 22  degreesC and allowed to recover for 1 week before taking photos. Scale bar represents 1 cm.\n\nHeat stress induced expression of HSFs and HSPs plays an important role in the acquisition of thermotolerance by plants. To investigate whether the susceptibility of annexin mutants to heat stress is related to the level of endogenous HSFs and HSPs, the heat induced expression of different HSFs and HSPs were analyzed in seedlings of wild type andann1 2/ann2double mutants. Under normal conditions, expression of HSFs is either not detected or at a similar level in both wild type andann1 2/ann2double mutants. Thirty minutes of heat shock induces a dramatic increase of HSFs expression in wild type seedlings. In comparison, the increase in expression of HSFs inann1 2/ann2double mutants is much smaller (Fig. 5A). Similar results were observed for the expression of HSPs. Before heat shock treatment, the protein levels of the HSP70, HSP90, and HSP17.7 inann1 2/ann2double mutants were similar to wild type. After heat shock at 37  degreesC for 3 h, the protein abundance of these three proteins in wild type seedlings was significantly higher than in those of theann1 2/ann2mutants (Fig. 5B). The reduced expression of HSFs and HSPs inann1 2/ann2mutants after heat treatment suggests annexin is required for the early changes in gene expression induced by heat shock.\n\nThe mRNA and protein expression level of several HSFs and HSPs is reduced inann1 2/ann2double mutant.A, Semi quantitative RT PCR analysis of the mRNA levels ofHSF A7A,HSF A2,HSF B1, andHSF B2Ain one week old wild type (Col 0) andann1/ann2double mutant (ann1/2) seedlings that were HS treated for the indicated time. The RT PCR products of UBC are shown as the equal loading control.B, Immunoblot analysis of the protein levels of HSP 17.7, HSP 25.3, HSP 70, and HSP 90 in wild  type andann1 2/ann2double mutant. One week old seedlings were treated with or without HS for the indicated time, total proteins were separated by SDS PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane and blotted with different HSP specific antibodies. Rubisco large subunit stained by Ponceau S is shown as the equal loading control.\n\nTo further confirm the function of annexin in plants' heat shock response, we overexpressedAtANN1inann1 2mutant background. RT PCR analysis confirmed that the expression level ofAtANN1in two transgenic lines, OX 1 and OX 2, were both higher than in wild type. Seedlings overexpressingAtANN1were more resistant to heat shock treatment than wild type seedlings. The average survival rate of annexin overexpressing seedlings was 20% higher than wild type seedlings, and the difference is statistically significant (Fig. 6). This result demonstrates that the expression level of annexin is directly related to the basal thermotolerance of youngArabidopsisseedlings.\n\nSeedlings overexpressingAtANN1are more resistant to heat shock treatment.A, Upper panel: RT PCR analysis of the expression level ofAtANN1in overexpressing plants. Lower panel: basal thermotolerance analysis ofAtANN1overexpressing plants. Seven day old seedlings grown on 1/2 MS plates at 22  degreesC were shifted to a 45  degreesC water bath for 12 min and then returned to 22  degreesC and allowed to recover for 1 week before taking photos.B, Quantification of survival rate of seedlings shown inA. Data represents the mean value from five independent experiments, with 20 seedlings per experiment. One way ANOVA test was performed. Statistically significant differences are indicated by different lowercase letters (p< 0.05). Error bars represent +/ S.D.\n\nPrior reports indicated that AtANN1 could function to increase the Ca2+permeability of plasma membranes during plant stress responses (23,24). In order to test whether heat induced calcium transport is altered in AtANN1 loss of function mutants, we crossed theann1 2andann1 2/ann2mutants with transgenic plants expressing35S::Aequorin(25), F3 segregant lines that were homozygous for35S::Aequorin/ann1 2and35S::Aequorin/ann1 2/ann2mutants were chosen and used for monitoring heat shock stimulated changes in [Ca2+]cyt. RT PCR showed the expression ofAtANN1andAtANN2is not detectable in our35S::Aequorinexpressingann1 2/ann2double knockout mutant (Fig. 7A). Measurement of cytosolic calcium concentration showed the highest luminescence signal emitted by reconstituted aequorin is lower in35S::Aequorinexpressingann1 2andann1 2/ann2mutants (Fig. 7B), which might be caused by the lower total calcium abundance in the seedlings (Fig. 7C). Because there is a difference in the reconstituted luminescence signals observed between wild type and the mutants, we used percentage reconstitution values to determine the relative luminescence in response to heat shock treatment for wild type and mutants seedlings. As shown inFig. 7D, in consistent with previous reports (11), heat shock treatment induced a rapid increase in [Ca2+]cytwithin 5 min in wild type,ann1 2, andann1 2/ann2mutants. The heat induced [Ca2+]cytcontinues to increase in wild type and reaches the highest peak around 12 min. In comparison, this prolonged increase in the heat induced [Ca2+]cytwas diminished inann1 2mutant and absent inann1 2/ann2double mutant (Fig. 7D). These results suggest that AtANN1 and AtANN2 function is important for the normal heat induced increase in [Ca2+]cytinArabidopsis.\n\nHeat induced increase in [Ca2+]cytin seedlings is impaired in Annexin mutants.A, RT PCR analysis ofAtANN1andAtANN2expression level in wild type (Col) andann1 2/ann2(ann1/2) double T DNA mutants.B,In vivoreconstitution of aequorin signal in wild type,ann1, andann1/2mutants.

Error bars represent +/ S.D.D, Time course measurement of aequorin signal in wild type,ann1andann1/2mutants. Seedlings were treated with or without heat shock. Relative aequorin signal is calculated by dividing percentage reconstitution value collected at 37  degreesC by percentage reconstitution value collected at 22  degreesC. These experiments have been repeated at least three times, and the trends are similar. Data shown here is from one representative experiment.",
    "discussion": "The heat induced rapid increase in [Ca2+]cytis considered to be an essential step in plant responses to heat stress. Prior reports showed this increase is regulated by plasma membrane localized cyclic nucleotide gated channels (CNGCs) (8,9) and phospholipase C9 (PLC9) (26), but there may be other calcium channels or membrane localized proteins involved in regulating this rapid and dynamic change in [Ca2+]cytin response to HS treatment. Because of prior studies showing that AtANN1 promoted the Ca2+permeability of plasma membranes, we selected it for further study from the microsomal proteins inArabidopsisseedlings whose level changed rapidly after heat shock. We found that AtANN1 plays an important role in regulating heat shock tolerance inArabidopsisseedlings and that seedlings knocked out in their expression ofAtANN1show impaired calcium influx in response to heat shock treatment. These results suggest AtANN1 is a new component in regulating heat shock induced elevation of intracellular calcium concentration in plant cells.\n\nAnnexins bind membranes in a calcium dependent manner. Although they appear to have diverse functions, it has become clear that certain annexins play important roles in abiotic stress responses (20,27). For example, ectopic expression of aBrassicaannexin inArabidopsisprovides tolerance to drought, salinity and osmotic stress (28), and overexpression ofAtANN1inArabidopsisincreases both drought tolerance in plants (29), and salinity tolerance in seeds (30). There are also previous studies linking annexins to heat stress responses in plants. For example, a recent proteomic study analyzing heat stress in radish leaves found that the level of an annexin protein increased at 12 h, and then decreased at 24 h in response to 40  degreesC heat treatment (31). Chuet al.also identified an annexin protein from the embryonic axes of sacred lotus (Nelumbo nuciferaGaertn.) that was up regulated by heat treatment. Ectopic expression of this lotus annexin inArabidopsisconferred resistance to heat treatment in seed germination (32). In this study, we discovered thatArabidopsisAtANN1 is an early participant in a plant's response to heat treatment. The increase in abundance of AtANN1 in the microsomal membrane fraction can be observed after only 5 min of heat treatment. Among the eight annexins in theArabidopsisgenome, AtANN1 is the most abundant and appears to be a multifunctional protein (33). We found that knocking out the expression of either endogenousAtANN1orAtANN2makes mutants hypersensitive to heat shock treatment, whereas knocking out the expressionAtANN6does not alter the sensitivity of the mutant, indicatingAtANN1andAtANN2, but notAtANN6, are functionally redundant in regulating plant basal thermotolerance. Correspondingly,Arabidopsisseedlings overexpressingAtANN1were more resistant to heat stress. Furthermore, heat induced expression of HSFs and HSPs is attenuated inann1 2/ann2double mutant. Taken together, these results suggestAtANN1andAtANN2are critical components of plants' adaptive responses to environmental heat stress.\n\nThere are numerous reports documenting AtANN1 functions as a calcium permeable channel like protein in response to abiotic stress, but most of the data was obtained from patch clamp experiments of spheroplasts and protoplasts of root epidermal cells (23,24,34). Here, using an aequorin reporting system, we found AtANN1 and AtANN2 play a role in regulating the elevation of [Ca2+]cytinduced by heat shock in whole seedlings. We found that heat induced change in [Ca2+]cytwas greatly reduced inann1mutant and was even lower inann1 2/ann2double mutant, which suggests that AtANN1 and AtANN2 are important components of the channel transport system that regulates heat induced increase in [Ca2+]cyt. However, heat shock still induces a small increase in [Ca2+]cytin theann1 2/ann2double mutant, especially in the first 5 min of heat shock treatment, which might be caused by the function of other proteins that facilitate Ca2+uptake, such as CNGCs inArabidopsis. Interestingly, the total calcium concentration inann1andann1/2mutant seedlings is lower than wild type control seedlings. However, future studies are needed to determine whether the reduced calcium accumulation is caused by the reduced calcium influx inann1andann1/2mutants.\n\nIn conclusion, we found that the abundance of AtANN1 protein in membranes increased rapidly in response to 5 min heat shock treatment, and that AtANN1 is critical for plant heat shock responses. Although it is still unresolved whether AtANN1 acts directly as a calcium permeable channelin vivoor facilitates this calcium transport by some other mechanism (35,36,37), our results strongly suggest that in addition to previously characterized calcium permeable channels, annexins are a significant component of the molecular machinery that promotes the heat induced increase in [Ca2+]cyt. However, our data provide no evidence that AtANN1 functions as a heat sensor during plant heat shock responses. Consequently, we propose that an elevated environmental temperature is first perceived by membrane sensors like CNGCs, which allows for an initial calcium influx into the cytosol. This increased [Ca2+]cytwould activate cytosolic AtANN1, recruiting it directly to membranes. The association of AtANN1 with membranes could then either form a calcium channel by itself or activate another calcium channel to allow more calcium influx into the cell needed to fully activate plant heat shock responses.",
