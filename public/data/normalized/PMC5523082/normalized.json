    "methods": "Primers used in this study are listed in Table S1.The fungal strains used in this study are listed in Table S2.The scheme for heterologously expressing the NRPS like genes ofA. terreusinA. nidulansis shown in Fig. S1.The direct repeat (DR) deletion andAfpyGmarker recycling experimental design is shown in Fig. S1.The construction of fusion PCR products, protoplast generation, and transformation were carried out as previously described.7,9The scheme of diagnostic PCR is shown in Fig. S8.\n\nFor real time qRT PCR, theA. terreuswild type strain and the mutant strain (apvA,atmelA::apvA) were cultivated on LCMM agar for mRNA extraction from conidia. TheA. terreuswild type strain was cultivated in LCMM liquid broth for mRNA extraction from hyphae. Total mRNA was extracted by using the Qiagen RNeasy Plant Mini Kit. The cDNA was made from the equal amount of mRNA. The expression of every gene was analyzed with the ABI 7900HT Fast Real Time PCR system (see ESI for experimental details).\n\n(1)A. nidulansstrain LO4389 and other HE mutant strains were cultivated at 37  degreesC in 50 ml LMM liquid medium (6 g l 1NaNO3, 0.52 g l 1KCl, 0.52 g l 1MgSO47H2O, 1.52 g l 1KH2PO4, 20 g l 1lactose supplemented with 1 ml l 1of trace element solution) at 1 x 106spore per ml per 125 ml flask with shaking at 180 rpm. The nutrients uridine, uracil, pyridoxine and riboflavin were supplemented if necessary. As previously reported,944 ul (10 mM) cyclopentanone was added into the medium after 18 h of incubation. The incubator temperature was then changed to 30  degreesC and the culture medium was collected 72 h after cyclopentanone induction. The medium was filtrated and extracted twice with ethyl acetate (EtOAc, 50 ml). Preparation of the HPLC MS samples and the condition for MS analysis were as previously described.7\n\n(2) For the prenyltransferase screening experiment,A. terreusNIH 2624 and the mutant strains were point inoculated at 30  degreesC on LCMM agar plates (6 g l 1NaNO3, 0.52 g l 1KCl, 0.52 g l 1MgSO47H2O, 1.52 g l 1KH2PO4, 10 g l 1d glucose, 20 g l 1lactose, 15 g l 1agar supplemented with 1 ml l 1of trace element solution) per plate (D= 10 cm). After 5 days, agar was chopped into small pieces and extracted with 50 ml MeOH followed by 60 ml 1:1 CH2Cl2/MeOH. The extract was evaporatedin vacuoto yield a water residue, which was suspended in 25 ml H2O and partitioned with 25 ml EtOAc, twice. Preparation of the HPLC MS samples and the condition for MS analysis were the same as previously described.7\n\n(3) For the extraction of different fungal tissues for aspulvinone production, the procedure was similar to a previously reported procedure.12,13Plates containing 20 ml LCMM agar (1.5% agar) were overlaid with another 10 ml of LCMM agar (0.75% agar). Plates were point inoculated with wild type or the DR mutant strains and grown at 30  degreesC for 4 days. Conidia were harvested by adding 7 ml salt solution (8.5 g l 1NaCl) followed by gently scraping with a sterile spreader. The conidial solution was inspected under the microscope to be largely free of hyphae and conidiophores. The conidial fraction was sonicated for 1 h and extracted twice with an equal volume of EtOAc. The top layer was then washed with 10 ml sterile water twice and removed with a sterile spatula. The bottom agar layer was then chopped into small pieces and extracted as previously described. Preparation of the HPLC MS samples from different tissues and the conditions for MS analysis were as previously described.7\n\nFor scale up,A. nidulansHE strains were cultivated at 37  degreesC in 1 liter LMM liquid medium (100 ml per flask) at 1 x 106spores per ml with shaking at 180 rpm. The nutrients uridine, uracil, pyridoxine and riboflavin were supplemented if necessary. To induce expression, 88 ul cyclopentanone was added into the medium after 18 h of incubation. The incubator temperature was then changed to 30  degreesC and the culture medium was collected 72 h after cyclopentanone induction. The medium was filtrated and extracted three times with equal volume of EtOAc. The combined EtOAc layers were evaporated to a crude extract. Further purification of fractions with targeted compounds was carried out by gradient HPLC on a C18 reverse phase column [Phenomenex Luna 5 um C18, 250 x 10 mm] with a flow rate of 5.0 ml min 1and measured by a UV detector at 254 nm.\n\nThe wild type and two mutant strains (atmelAp gfp,apvAp gfp) were cultivated on the two layer agar plates as mentioned. Plates were point inoculated with wild type or the mutant strains and grown at 30  degreesC for 5 days. The conidia were collected as previously described and the conidial solution was diluted 10 times with sterile water. A 10 ul portion of the diluted solution was placed on a pre cleaned microscope slide and covered with a coverslip. For imaging of the hyphal GFP fluorescence signal, the top layer was removed as previously described. A small portion of hyphae containing agar (<10 ul) was placed on a pre cleaned microscope slide and covered with a coverslip. All the samples were examined under an optical microscope to confirm that the conidia and hyphae could be clearly visualized. Images were taken with a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta NLO (Thornwood, NY) confocal imaging system equipped with Argon, red HeNe, and green HeNe lasers and a Coherent Chameleon Ti Sapphire laser mounted on a vibration free table.",
    "results": "Using a recently reported efficient heterologous expression (HE) system inA. nidulans,9the individual NRPS like genes identified in theA. terreusgenome were expressed at either thewAoryAlocus ofA. nidulansunder regulation of the induciblealcApromoter (Fig. S1A). In a previous study, targeted deletion ofapvAdepleted production of aspulvinones inA. terreusindicating that this NRPS like gene is responsible for the biosynthesis of the aspulvinone core.7As expected, heterologous expression ofapvAresults in accumulation of aspulvinone E (1) which is speculated to be the first intermediate in the aspulvinone pathway (Fig. 1and2A and B).7Unexpectedly, our HE experiments revealed that AtmelA produces the same compound (Fig. 2A and B). The geneapvAis responsible for aspulvinone biosynthesis whileatmelAis involved in the synthesis of the brown conidial pigment.7The brown conidial melanin is still produced in theapvAdeletant strain as shown inFig. 3A. In contrast, deletion ofatmelAgenerates an albino mutant that is still capable of synthesizing aspulvinones.7Together, these data reveal that despite having the same activity (i.e.synthesis of aspulvinone E), ApvA and AtmelA function in different roles in the fungus.\n\nTo test our hypothesis that the aspulvinone E is an intermediate in two different pathways, the aspulvinone pathway and melanin pathway, we wished to delete the first tailoring gene in each pathway to accumulate the precursor produced by the gene responsible for the backbone metabolite. Since we have established the genetic linkage betweenapvAand aspulvinones,7we set out to identify the first tailoring enzyme, which we presumed was responsible for prenylating1to give2(Fig. 2A). However, we could not locate a prenyl transferase (PT) gene proximal toapvA.7We then targeted each of the putative PT genes in theA. terreusgenome for deletion (Fig. 4). The individual genes were knocked out using fragments created by fusion PCR.7The SM profiles of the correct mutants were examined by LC MS, and of the 11 different mutants, only the ATEG_01730.1 strain accumulated aspulvinone E (1) (Fig. 4). Unexpectedly, removal of ATEG_01730.1 leads to the accumulation of butyrolactone II (5) as well (Fig. 4). A previous study showed that the NRPS like genebtyAis responsible for the biosynthesis of butyrolactone core.7The expression of three genes,apvA,btyA, andabpBwere also analyzed using real time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT PCR). (Fig. S2C) Our data showed that these three genes are co expressed under aspulvinone and butyrolactone producing conditions. These pieces of evidence suggest that this single PT is responsible for the prenylation of two different metabolites, aspulvinone E (1) and butyrolactone II (5). Thus, we name the genea(aspulvinone)b(butyrolactone)p(PT)B.\n\nDefinitively establishing the role of AtmelA in the synthesis of aspulvinone E (1) required additional gene deletion experiments. We first deleted the geneapvAusing the direct repeat (DR) strategy10followed by the recycling of theAfpyrGmarker (Fig. S1B). This ensures that aspulvinone E (1) identified in the later mutants is not from ApvA. However, limited information is available about the biosynthesis of the brown conidial melanin inA. terreus. Our study suggests that the melanin pathway originates from the NRPS like product aspulvinone E (1), which is unlike the two main precursors [di hydroxyphenylalanin (DOPA) and dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN)] of currently known melanins.11The biosynthesis of DOPA melanin starts with a tyrosine that is oxidized to either DOPA or dopaquinone (DAQ) by a tyrosinase.11Considering that aspulvinone E (1) shares the same phenol moiety as tyrosine, we speculate that a similar tyrosinase might catalyze the hydroxylation of1at theorthoposition to give a dihydroxylated intermediate that becomes incorporated into the brown melanin (Fig. 1). Following the cluster paradigm, we examined the genes surroundingatmelAand identified one gene ATEG_03564.1 (atmelB) that encodes a putative tyrosinase. Removal of this gene in theapvA background changed the strain's phenotype: the brown melanin was no longer synthesized and the conidia became bright yellow (Fig. 3A). As expected, the yellow material is aspulvinone E (1), which accumulated in the metabolite profiles of theapvAandatmelBdouble deletion strain (Fig. 3B). We next deleted the geneatmelAin the doubleapvA,atmelB strain. The LC MS profile of this triple deletion mutant shows the abrogation of the aspulvinone E (1) which had reappeared in the double mutant (Fig. 3B), in accord with our HE results that AtmelA was also capable of producing Aspulvinone E (1).\n\nOur studies indicate that ApvA and AtmelA synthesize the same product aspulvinone E (1). We next asked how the fungus is able to allocate the same chemical synthesized by different proteins into their own specific pathway without cross interference. Previous literature reports have shown that the production of SMs and/or their precursors can be specific to both cellular organelle and fungal tissue.12,13We speculated that the aspulvinone E (1) from the two genes might be generated in different fungal tissues. Since removal ofatmelAoratmelBchanges the phenotype ofA. terreusconidia (Fig. 3A), it is likely that aspulvinone E (1) from AtmelA might be produced in conidia. Likewise aspulvinones, derived from1that is produced by ApvA, might be produced inside the hyphae and secreted into the medium.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, we performed tissue specific extraction12,13to reinvestigate the SM profiles of the four strains ((1) wild type; (2)abpB; (3)apvA,atmelB; (4)apvA,atmelB,atmelA). Fungal cultures were divided into three fractions: (1) conidial (mostly conidia and minor conidiophore), (2) top layer agar (mixture of conidiophore, vegetative hyphae, minor invasive hyphae), (3) lower layer agar (mostly invasive hyphae) (Fig. 3C and D). Compared to the SM profiles of total extracts (Fig. 3B), extraction of the conidia showed the accumulation of1only in theapvA,atmelB strain (Fig. 3C), not in strains carryingabpB oratmelA. This result indicates that aspulvinone E (1) from AtmelA is produced in conidia. Extraction of the hyphal (mostly invasive) fraction showed the production of1in theabpB strain and compound2in wild type, indicating that aspulvinone E (1) from ApvA and its derivative2are specifically produced in hyphae.\n\nNext, we asked about the molecular mechanism for regulating the tissue specific production of1. We first examined the expression profiling ofatmelAandapvAin different tissues using Real Time qRT PCR (Fig. S2, see ESIfor experimental details). As expected, the geneatmelAis specifically expressed in conidia compartment (Fig. S2B) while the geneapvAis locally expressed in hyphae (Fig. S2C). We then probed this question by determining whether ApvA could replace AtmelA in brown melanin biosynthesis. We assumed that tailoring enzymes like AtmelB could still recognize aspulvinone E (1) generated from either ApvA or AtmelA. Another study suggests that the products of two tubulin genes,benAandtubC, are functionally interchangeable. The method they used was to disruptbenAand then puttubCunder control of thebenApromoter.14,15Herein we implemented a similar strategy by replacing the coding region ofatmelAwith that ofapvA, placingapvAunder control of theatmelApromoter (atmelAp) in theapvA background (Fig. S1Ci). As shown inFig. 5A, the mutant stain (apvA,atmelA::apvA) produces brownish conidia indicating that the brown conidial pigment is produced in the mutant strain (apvA,atmelA::apvA). As anticipated, the production of aspulvinones (1or2) were not detected (Fig. S3). The pigment is not produced as much as in the wild type (Fig. 5A) probably becauseatmelAp, after all, is not the native promoter of ApvA. Quantitative analysis of their expression using Real Time qRT PCR reveals that the expression level ofapvA, which is under the control of atmelA promoter, is lower than that ofatmelA. (Fig. S2B) This could be one of the reasons for reduced production of the conidial melanin in the mutant strain (apvA,atmelA::apvA). But more importantly, our experiment shows that compound1fromapvAcan be incorporated into the melanin pathway whenapvAis regulated byatmelAp. As mentioned earlier, the production of1fromatmelAis conidia specific. Thus, this experiment shows that the product of ApvA can also be produced inside conidia and incorporated into melanin, suggesting that the tissue specific allocation of their products may be due to cell type specific expression of the genesatmelAandapvAunder regulation of their specific promoters.\n\nTo test our hypothesis, we generated two mutants (atmelAp gfp,apvAp gfp) in which the coding regions ofapvAandatmelAwere replaced by the green fluorescent protein coding sequence (gfp), placinggfpunder control of their specific promoters (Fig. S1Cii). Both the melanin pathway and aspulvinones biosynthetic pathways are active whenA. terreusis cultivated on LCMM agar. Under this culture condition, we hypothesized thatatmelApwould turn on the expression ofgfpspecifically inside the conidia while thegfpregulated byapvApwould display a green fluorescent signal in the hyphae. As expected, we were able to visualize localization of GFP within the conidia only in the strain carryingatmelAp gfpbut not in the parental strain (used as control) or the strainapvAp gfp. (Fig. 5B) In comparison, hyphal localization of GFP fluorescence was observed only in strainapvAp gfp. (Fig. 5B) Thus, the tissue specific accumulation of aspulvinone E (1) is probably due to cell type specific expression of the two genesapvAandatmelA.",
    "discussion": "Our study suggests that metabolite diversity can be expanded by spatial regulation of the same precursor biosynthesized by two distinct genes. Melanin plays an important role in fungal pathogenesis as well as in the protection of the producing organisms from ultraviolet radiation.11,16,17No definite structures for melanins have been elucidated due to their large molecular weight, insolubility in aqueous or organic solvents, and heterogeneity.11The characterized conidial melanin of mostAspergillusspecies belongs to the dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN) melanin class.11Our study reports a unique and unprecedented pathway of conidial pigment biosynthesis inA. terreusthat originates from the NRPS like product aspulvinone E (1) (Fig. 1). We also identified one putative tyrosinase encoded by the geneatmelBthat is involved in a tailoring modification of aspulvinone E (1) to yield the brown conidial pigment (Fig. 1). We speculate that the function of the tyrosinase, AtmelB, might resemble that of its homolog which participates in dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) melanin biosynthesis11and catalyzes theorthohydroxylation of the phenol moiety in the aspulvinone E (1) core (Fig. 1). It is entirely possible that other genes are involved in the polymerization of the dual hydroxylated aspulvinone E and more efforts will be needed to decipher the complete biosynthetic pathway of the brown conidial melanin inA. terreus.\n\nCompounds in the aspulvinone family have been found to have anti influenza A viral (H1N1) activity and are potent inhibitors of firefly luciferase.18,19The production of aspulvinones, as revealed in a previous study, is a general stress response ofA. terreus.20The biological functions of aspulvinones, and what role they play in the biology ofA. terreus, remain elusive. AtmelA shares 73% sequence similarity with ApvA. We noted that there is a 63 bp sequence inatmelA, corresponding to the TE domain of AtmelA, that has strong nucleotide identity with a portion ofapvA, indicating that these two genes may share a common origin (Fig. S5C). Interestingly, homology analysis ofapvAand its surrounding genes showed thatapvAis inserted into a conserved genome region consisting of genes that are essential for fungal survival (Fig. S4). It is possible that the insertion ofapvAis due to the duplication and translocation of its ancestral homolog. The production of aspulvinone type SMs byA. terreus, in response to general stress, could be related to the chromosomal location of its producing geneapvA. However, more experiments are definitely necessary to elucidate the exact role the aspulvinone type metabolites play in the growth, survival or metabolic processes of the fungusA. terreus.\n\nPrevious literature suggested thatp hydroxylphenylpyruvate (HPP), which originates from the shikimate pathway, is the biosynthetic precursor of aspulvinones.21,22The shikimate pathway, highly conserved in bacteria, fungi, and plant species, generates carbon skeletons for the aromatic amino acids including tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine.23HPP is proposed to be an intermediate in the conversion of prephenate tol tyrosine in the shikimate pathway. Limited information has been reported regarding the tissue localization of HPP in fungi. Our study suggests that the distribution of HPP is not limited to certain types of fungal compartments since both the biosynthesis of brown conidial melanin and hyphae specific aspulvinones requires the presence of HPP. Our data indicate that the tissue specific expression ofapvAandatmelAare due to the promoters of the two genes. The promoter ofapvAdrives expression specifically in hyphae while the promoter ofatmelAdrives expression in conidia. There are many examples of hyphalversusspore specific gene regulation. For example, the expression of the melanin synthesis geneatmelAmight regulated by spore specific transcriptional regulators as demonstrated in a recent study showing that BrlA, the transcription factor required to initiate conidiophore development inAspergillusspp., is necessary for fumiquinazoline gene expression and product production.13The fact thatatmelApis capable of turning on the expression of bothapvA(SM gene) and thegfp(reporter gene), suggests that it might be a useful tool for directing the expression of genes specifically inside of conidia.\n\nBesides spatial regulation of the intermediate, the SM diversity can be further expanded, as shown in our study, through tailoring enzymes that are capable of modifying SMs with different chemical scaffolds. Early literature reported the enzymatic characterization of aspulvinone dimethylallyltransferase inA. terreus. This enzyme is capable of catalyzing the mono or dual prenylation of aspulvinone E (1).24The substrate promiscuity of some PTs has also been testedin vitroby feeding experiments.25Our study reveals thein vivoversatility of AbpB, as it accepts substrates with different chemical scaffolds. Interestingly, the three genes are dispersed in theA. terreusgenome (abpBon chromosome II;apvAon chromosome III;btyAon chromosome IV), representing another deviation from the SM gene cluster paradigm. We have discovered inA. nidulansthat in some cases, the corresponding PT genes are not located in the same cluster as the core PKS genes.26,27Further comparison of the butyrolactones with aspulvinones shows that the chemical modifications after prenylation, including epoxidation and dehydrogenation, are very similar (Fig. S6). Thus, these two natural product families may share the same set of tailoring enzymes that specifically modifies the prenyl groups attached by AbpB.\n\nFungi are capable of producing a large variety of SMs with unique chemical scaffolds. It is usually expected that core synthetic genes, in a given species, are behind the biosynthesis of different core intermediates, as demonstrated in a study showing that all individual NRPKS inA. nidulansgenerate a unique PKS product.5Phylogenetic analysis, using the protein sequences of those NRPS like homologs obtained from the Broad InstituteAspergilluscomparative database, revealed several other characterized NRPS like homologs including TdiA (terrequinone A biosynthesis inA. nidulans),8RalA (ralfuranone biosynthesis inRalstonia solanacearum),28MicA (microperfuranone biosynthesis inA. nidulans),29AtqA (asterriquinone biosynthesis inA. terreus),7BtyA (butyrolactone biosynthesis inA. terreus),7and EchA (echosides biosynthesis inStreptomycessp. LZ35)30(Fig. S5). These NRPS like enzymes, with A T TE domain architecture, fall within Clade I of the phylogenetic tree (Fig. S5). They are capable of synthesizing natural products with various chemical scaffolds using similar substrates like phenylpyruvic acid. Previous literature suggested that these pyruvic acid substrates could be producedviathe shikimate pathway.21,31,32The TE domains are proposed to catalyze various condensation, cyclization and releasing reactions to yield different chemical backbones.8In comparison, another characterized NRPS like protein (encoded by ATEG_03630.1), with A T R domain arrangement, belongs to Clade V (Fig. S5).33In this case, the aryl acid substrate, generated by an adjacent PKS (encoded by ATEG_03629.1), is loaded onto the A domain and is reduced to its aryl aldehyde precursor by the R domain. Thus, SM diversity is enriched from these disparate starting points. It is also common to identify two highly homologous core synthetic genes, in different species, that produces the same precursor. For example, in the biosynthesis of the meroterpenoids austinol (A. nidulans) and terretonin (A. terreus), the two PKS genesausAandtrt4synthesize the same intermediate 3, 5 dimethylorsellinic acid.34",
    "conclusion": "Our work indicates that chemical diversity in SM biosynthesis can be expandedviamultiple dimensions. Prior to our work, the richness of the fungal SM pool was presumed to be determined by the number of SM gene clusters while the clustered genes are associated with the biosynthesis of a distinct type of SM, with some exceptions.12,13,35In our study, we have shown thatA. terreusdeploys an additional strategy to enrich its natural product pool. Although the same precursor aspulvinone E (1) is shared in two pathways (the aspulvinone pathway, a typical SM pathway and the melanin pathway, producing a self protection pigment that might also be involved in the pathogenicity of this fungus), the tissue specific expression of their biosynthetic genes results in the production of the same compound in different fungal tissues and allows it to be modified into two different products that, we assume, confer selective advantages in the specific tissues in which they are produced. The localization of production is possibly regulated by their specific promoters, but it is entirely possible that a more complex regulatory mechanism underlies this phenomenon. This expands our insight into spatial regulation of SMs in fungi.36More investigation into these promoters might provide a means to the cell type directed biosynthesis of SMs or manipulating the location of the expression of some genes responsible for products with interesting biological activities. Finally, our data demonstrate that AbpB prenylates compounds in two pathways revealing that two pathways may share the same tailoring genes. It will be of interest to determine if this characteristic is common to, and specific to, prenyl transferases."
