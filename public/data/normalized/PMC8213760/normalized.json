    "abstract": "Sixteen week old female C57BL/6J mice were sacrificed aboard the International Space Station after 37 days of flight (RR 1 mission) and frozen carcasses returned to Earth. RNA was isolated from interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT) and gonadal white adipose tissue (WAT). Spaceflight resulted in differential expression of genes in BAT consistent with increased non shivering thermogenesis and differential expression of genes in WAT consistent with increased glucose uptake and metabolism, adipogenesis, and beta oxidation.\n\nSubject terms:Biochemistry, Molecular biology",
    "methods": "Details of the spaceflight mission are published25. Animal protocol was reviewed and approved by the NASA Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee prior to the conduct of experiments. In brief, 16 week old female B6 mice were sacrificed aboard the ISS after 37 days of flight and frozen carcasses were returned to Earth for tissue preparation and method validation as described21. Sensors in the Habitats (flight and ground) monitored and relayed information including component temperature and humidity. The data were logged at sampling rate of 1Hz. Ground control mice were sacrificed and processed using the same timelines and protocols as the flight animals.\n\nRNA was isolated from individual BAT (n=8/group) and WAT (n=6/group) samples. RNA integrity number (RIN) was assessed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer (Santa Clara, CA, USA). A RIN value of 5 and above is required to ensure reliable quantification of gene expression by RT qPCR26,27. The RIN numbers (mean+/ SE,n=6/group) for RNA isolated from BAT from flight and ground control animals were 6.55+/ 0.47, and 7.42+/ 0.46, respectively. Thus RNA from both groups of animals were of good quality. mRNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using SuperScript III First Strand Synthesis SuperMix for qRT PCR (ThermoFisher Scientific). Expression levels for genes related to adipogenesis was determined for BAT and WAT using the Mouse Adipogenesis RT2Profiler PCR Array (Qiagen). Gene expression was normalized using GusB and ActB housekeeping genes, and relative quantification ( Ct method) was determined using RT2Profiler PCR Array Data Analysis software (Qiagen).\n\nFurther information on research design is available in theNature Research Reporting Summarylinked to this article.",
