    "abstract": "RNA polymerase (RNAP) is a highly conserved macromolecular machine that contributes to the flow of genetic information from genotype to phenotype. InBacillus subtilis, mutations in therpoBgene encoding the beta subunit of RNAP have been shown to alter a number of global phenotypes, including growth, utilization of unusual nutrient sources, sporulation, germination, and production of secondary metabolites. In addition, the spectrum of mutations inrpoBleading to rifampin resistance (Rifr) can change dramatically depending upon the environment to whichB. subtiliscells or spores are exposed. RifrrpoBmutations have historically been associated with slower growth and reduced fitness; however, these assessments of fitness were conducted on limited collections of mutants in rich laboratory media that poorly reflect natural environments typically inhabited byB. subtilis. Using a novel deep sequencing approach in addition to traditional measurements of growth rate, lag time, and pairwise competitions, we demonstrated that the competitive advantages of specificrpoBalleles differ depending on the growth environment in which they are determined.\n\nIMPORTANCEMicrobial resistance to antibiotics is a growing threat to public health across the world. Historically, resistance to antibiotics has been associated with reduced fitness. A growing body of evidence indicates that resistance to rifampin, a frontline antibiotic used to treat mycobacterial and biofilm associated infections, may increase fitness given an appropriate environment even in the absence of the selective antibiotic. Here, we experimentally confirm this phenomenon by directly comparing the fitness of multiple rifampin resistant mutants ofBacillus subtilisin rich LB medium and an asparagine minimal medium. Our research demonstrates that the fitness cost of rifampin resistance can vary greatly depending upon the environment. This has important implications for understanding how microbes develop antimicrobial resistance in the absence of antibiotic selection.\n\nKEYWORDS:Bacillus subtilis, evolution, RNA polymerase, fitness, rifampin, rifampin resistance, transcription",
    "methods": "AllB. subtilisstrains and plasmids used in this study are listed inTable 1. The strains were constructed by DNA mediated transformation of competent cells with purified genomic DNA as previously described (47). The complex media used were Miller LB medium (48) and Trypticase soy yeast extract (TSY) medium (49). The minimal medium used was Spizizen minimal medium (50) containing the auxotrophic requirements tryptophan and phenylalanine (50ug/mL each) and asparagine (95mM) in place of glucose as the carbon source (SMMAsn). Media were solidified with agar (15 g/L) as needed. The antibiotics used (final concentration) were chloramphenicol (10ug/mL), rifampin (5ug/mL), kanamycin (5ug/mL), neomycin (5ug/mL), or spectinomycin (100ug/mL). Plasmids for CRISPR Cas9 introduction of point mutations were constructed and used as previously described (51). Site directed mutagenesis was conducted via inverse PCR as previously described (52) to introduce the point mutation A478V into anrpoBtemplate. All mutations were confirmed by Sanger sequencing (Genewiz LLC) of PCR amplicons.\n\nFor quantification of Rifr, an overnight culture of each strain was grown in liquid TSY without antibiotics. One microliter of overnight culture was inoculated into 100ul of liquid TSY medium without Rif or containing Rif at a 2 fold range of concentrations from 4 to 256ug/mL. Cells were grown in 96 well microtiter plates sealed with gas permeable membranes (Breathe Easy; Sigma Aldrich). Growth at 37 degreesC was measured by the optical density at 620 nm (OD620) at 15 minute intervals in a temperature controlled microplate absorbance spectrophotometer (model ELx808; BioTek). The resulting growth data from triplicate experiments were then used to determine the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50).\n\nLiquid cultures were propagated in 125 mL sidearm (Klett) flasks in 10mL of LB at 37 degreesC in a rotary shaking bath with vigorous aeration. Growth was measured at 15 minute intervals by the OD660using a Klett Summerson colorimeter fitted with the no. 66 (red, 660 nm) filter. Growth rates were calculated from the exponential portion of each growth curve. Lag times were determined from the point of intersection of the lag and exponential portions of each growth curve. Growth rates and lag times were determined from triplicate cultures. Data sets were tested for normality using the Shapiro Wilk test online calculator (https://www.statskingdom.com/shapiro wilk test calculator.html), and all data sets were found to be normally distributed. Statistical parameters and tests of significance (analysis of variance [ANOVA]) were computed using KaleidaGraph version 4.5.2 (Synergy Software, Reading, PA, USA).\n\nIndividual overnight cultures of the wild type strain and all congenic Rifrstrains were inoculated into fresh individual 2 mL LB cultures. Upon entering stationary phase, the OD660of each culture was measured and a volume corresponding to 108cells of each strain was combined into a single mixed culture, which was then diluted 1:100 into 10mL of either LB or SMMAsnin 125 mL Erlenmeyer flasks. Cultures were grown at 37 degreesC in a temperature controlled rotary shaking bath at 200rpm. Every 24h, cultures were diluted 1:100 into fresh medium. Under these conditions, cultures progress through 7 generations per day (53). For multiallelic competition experiments, every 24h, from each culture, a 1 mL aliquot was pelleted for chromosomal DNA extraction; 0.8mL was stored in 25% (vol/vol) glycerol at  70 degreesC, and 0.1mL was diluted serially 10 fold in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), plated on LB with chloramphenicol (Cm), and incubated overnight at 37 degreesC for total viable counts. For two allele competition experiments, every 24h, 0.1mL of each culture was serially diluted and plated on two different LB plates, each supplemented with a different antibiotic. These LB plates were then incubated overnight at 37 degreesC to determine the viable counts of each strain. Relative fitness was quantified with a previously described selection coefficient model (54).\n\nFrom purified chromosomal DNA, two 500 bp amplicons of therpoBgene, one spanning the N cluster and one spanning clusters I, II, and III, were amplified by PCR using Q5 high fidelity DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) and the corresponding primer pairs (Table 2). PCR products were purified (Qiagen PCR purification kit) and quantified by Qubit fluorometry, and equal amounts were combined for library preparation. Next generation sequencing libraries were prepared using an Illumina Nextera XT DNA library preparation kit with some modifications. Due to the high levels of NaOH in the Nextera XT bead based normalization process, the native normalization process is not compatible with the iSeq100. In place of the bead based normalization process, normalization was performed manually by capillary electrophoresis using the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 expert software to calculate the molar amount of DNA fragments in each library. Equivalent amounts of DNA fragments from 24 individual libraries were pooled at a final DNA fragment concentration of 4nM. Pooled libraries were diluted to 50 pM prior to loading into an Illumina i1 reagent box and sequenced on an Illumina iSeq100 next generation sequencing platform.\n\nOligonucleotide primers used in this study\n\nBold underlined letter represents mutation being introduced.\n\nUppercase letters represent bases complementary to BsaI cut site on pJOE8999 (51); lowercase letters represent wild typerpoBsequence.\n\nUppercase letters represent SfiI recognition and cut site complementary to pJOE8999 (51); lowercase letters represent wild type genomic sequence.\n\nNGS, next generation sequencing; sgRNA, single guide RNA.\n\nRaw data from the iSeq100 was demultiplexed and converted to fastq files using Illumina bcl2fastq software. Quality control of reads was performed with FastQC (55). Quality reads were mapped to theBacillus subtilisstrain 168 reference genome (GenBank accession numberAL009126.3) using Bowtie 2 (56). From mapped reads, LoFreq (57) was used to call single nucleotide polymorphisms and small deletions in therpoBgene. Preliminary calibration experiments performed with known proportions of mutantrpoBalleles established that the lower limit of detection was 0.1% (data not shown).\n\nAll data sets were tested for normality using the Shapiro Wilk method (58). Data sets passing the normality test were analyzed for differences by ANOVA with Tukey's honestly significant difference (HSD) test (59) or Dunnett's test for multiple comparison analysis (60). All statistical analyses were performed with the statistical graphing software Prism (GraphPad Software). Differences with aPvalue of <0.05 were considered statistically significant.",
    "results": "The natural environment often contains inhibitory or subinhibitory levels of various antibiotics; thus, natural antibiotic resistance would confer a selective advantage in such environments (reviewed in reference25). Through our studies of Rifrover the years, we have amassed a collection of congenicB. subtilisstrains, each carrying 1 of 17 different Rifrmutations inrpoB(Table 1). We measured the levels of Rifrin these strains by measuring the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) for Rif in LB medium by the broth dilution method (Fig. 1). As expected, the wild type laboratory strain was very sensitive to Rif (IC50of 0.06+/ 0.01ug/mL). All mutantrpoBalleles that had been selected on a high concentration of Rif (50ug/mL) (12,13) exhibited high IC50values of >100ug/mL, whereas mutantrpoBalleles selected on a low concentration of Rif (5ug/mL) (17) exhibited generally lower IC50values, ranging from 4 to 84ug/mL, the lowest of which was still at least 67 fold higher than that of the wild type strain (Fig. 1). Thus, in the context of growth in a selective environment containing Rif, all the RifrrpoBmutants would be expected to be more fit than the wild type strain.\n\nB. subtilisstrains and plasmids used in this study\n\nBGSC,BacillusGenetic Stock Center.\n\nsgRpoB, single guide RNA for RpoB.\n\nDetermination of IC50values of Rif inB. subtilisstrains used in this study. Results are presented as averages +/  standard deviations (n=3). w.t., wild type.\n\nIn the absence of Rif selection, it has been noted previously that mutations inrpoBleading to Rifroften exert a fitness cost, such as a lower growth rate as measured in standard laboratory media (26; reviewed in reference27). To test this notion, we measured the growth rates of wild typeB. subtilisand 17 congenicrpoBmutants in individual liquid LB shake flask cultures (Fig. 2). It was observed that 10 of the 17rpoBmutant strains grew significantly more slowly than the wild type (Fig. 2), consistent with the notion thatrpoBmutations can exert a fitness cost (26). However, 8 of the 17rpoBmutants grew at a rate statistically indistinguishable from that of the wild type strain (Fig. 2). The results indicate that not all Rifrmutants exhibit lowered fitness in LB under standard laboratory conditions, as measured by growth rate.\n\nGrowth rates ofB. subtilisstrains cultivated in liquid LB in shake flasks with aeration. Strains carrying the indicatedrpoBmutations were grown as described in Materials and Methods. Results are presented as averages +/  standard deviations (n=3). *,P<0.05; **,P<0.01; ***,P<0.001; ****,P<0.0001 (ordinary one way ANOVA with Dunnett's test for multiple comparison to the mean value for the wild type strain).\n\nThe growth rate experiments described above were performed on individual strains in monoculture, which may not reflect their true fitness in a complex competitive environment such as would likely prevail in nature. Therefore, to directly compare the fitness ofrpoBalleles, we performed, in triplicate cultures, a multigenerational and multistrain competition experiment in which the wild type strain and all 17 RifrrpoBmutant strains were competed simultaneously in LB (Fig. 3). At daily (7 generation) intervals, the proportion of eachrpoBallele in the mixed population was determined by next generation sequencing of two 500 bp PCR amplicons spanning either the N cluster or clusters I, II, and III of therpoBgene (Fig. 3A). At generation zero of the experiment, eachrpoBallele was present at 5 to 6% of the total population. By generation 35, the wild type strain came to dominate all three cultures, and the proportion of most Rifrmutant alleles had dropped below the level of detection (0.1%) (Fig. 3A). Two RifrrpoBmutants persisted until the end of the experiment, the H482N and A478D variants. Although the growth rate of the H482N mutant was not significantly higher than that of the wild type strain when grown separately in monoculture (Fig. 2), the mutant appeared to be less fit in a competitive environment (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, the A478D mutant appeared to almost disappear from the population by 14 generations, but beginning at 35 generations, it increased again in frequency to an average of 25% of the population by generation 49 (Fig. 3A). This anomalous result prompted us to more closely examine the allelic frequencies of the wild type, H482N, and A478D strains in each of the three replicate mixed cultures. We observed that in two of the three replicate cultures, the A478D allele behaved like the majority of the RifrrpoBmutations, becoming reduced to a very low, barely detectable frequency (Fig. 3BandC). In contrast, in the third culture, the A478D mutant initially dropped below the limit of detection (0.1%), but then starting at generation 35, it increased dramatically in frequency to comprise over 80% of that population by generation 49 (Fig. 3D). Closer examination of the PCR amplicon spanning clusters I, II, and III from the A478D mutant arising after generation 35 in the third culture revealed the appearance of a second mutation inrpoB, I528V. Furthermore, Sanger sequencing of therpoBgene of a Rifrisolate from this culture, strain WN1663, confirmed the presence of the I528V mutation in addition to the original A478D mutation. These observations led us to suspect that during the competition experiment in the third culture, the original A478D strain had suffered a second site mutation inrpoB, dramatically increasing its competitive fitness. To determine if this compensatory mutation was responsible for the observed increase in relative fitness, both the ancestral (A478D) and evolved (A478D+I528V) alleles were transferred into a clean wild type background to create strains WN1658 and WN1662, respectively. To test their competitive fitness, the four congenic strains WN1621 (wild type), WN1658 (A478D), WN1663 (evolved A478+I528V, isolated from the generation 49 culture of the experiment whose results are shown inFig. 3D), and WN1662 (A478D+I528V, reconstructed in a wild type background) were each competed separately against the same isogenic wild type strain (strain WN624, carrying a spectinomycin resistance [Spcr] marker) in LB medium (Fig. 4). Pairwise competition experiments showed that strain WN1658, the A478DrpoBmutant, was dramatically less fit than the wild type (selection coefficient [S] =  1.26+/ 0.35), whereas the evolved isolate strain WN1663 (A478D+I528V) was dramatically more fit than the wild type (S= +0.84+/ 0.23) (Fig. 4). However, simple reconstruction of the A478D+I528VrpoBdouble mutation in an otherwise wild type background (strain WN1662) resulted in only a modest increase in fitness (S=  0.47+/ 0.05) compared to that seen in the single A478D mutant and failed to replicate the dramatic increase in fitness seen in the evolved strain WN1663 (Fig. 4). We therefore conclude that while the second site mutation I528V inrpoBincreased competitive fitness to a certain extent, it was not sufficient to account for the dramatic increase in fitness seen in strain 1663 arising in the third multiallelic competition culture in the experiment whose results are shown inFig. 3D. The results lead us to hypothesize that strain WN1663 had sustained genomic mutation(s) in addition to I528V that also contributed to its dramatically increased fitness. These putative additional mutations could be revealed by whole genome sequencing, which is beyond the scope of the present study. Results from the experiment whose results are shown inFig. 3indicated that, when challenged in a more complex competitive environment (18rpoBvariants growing together for 49 generation in LB medium in the absence of Rif selection), all of the Rifrmutations inrpoBled to a generalized reduction in fitness. This result is somewhat at odds with the conclusions drawn from measurements of growth rates of the same strains in monoculture (Fig. 2), indicating that fitness cannot be predicted by growth rate in monoculture alone.\n\n(A) Population dynamics of wild type (WT) and 17rpoBmutant strains ofB. subtilisin LB liquid medium grown with aeration at 37 degreesC.

However, in nature,B. subtilisis found in soils or associated with plants and their roots. Such natural environments are either subjected to \"feast or famine\" conditions or are chronically oligotrophic; therefore, cells would need to utilize limited quantities of rarer, more ephemeral nutrient sources. In previous work, we performed OmniLog global metabolic profiling on wild typeB. subtilisand 11 RifrrpoBmutants to assess how mutations inrpoBcould affect metabolic capabilities (8). Indeed, we found that several environmental nutrients, normally utilized poorly by the wild type laboratory strain ofB. subtilis, were used significantly better by certain RifrrpoBmutants. In particular, we noted that a strain carrying the S487LrpoBsubstitution utilized the amino acidsl alanine,l asparagine,l glutamate, andl serine significantly better than the wild type (8).l Asparagine specifically has been found to be substantially present in root exudates and plays a significant role in determining the bacterial species composition of the rhizosphere (28). Based on these observations, we were interested in measuring the relative fitness of wild type and 17 RifrrpoBmutant strains ofB. subtilisin a more stringent selective environment. We therefore modified Spizizen minimal medium by replacing glucose withl asparagine as the sole carbon source (SMMAsn; see Materials and Methods for details) and again performed a multiallele, multigenerational competition experiment (Fig. 5). Based on its performance in OmniLog metabolic assays (8), we reasoned that the S487L mutant would fare better in this more stringent environment than the wild type or other Rifrmutant strains.\n\n(A) Population dynamics of wild type (WT) and 17rpoBmutant strains ofB. subtilisin SMMAsnliquid medium grown with aeration at 37 degreesC. Data shown are average values (n=3). (B to D) Population dynamics of wild type (WT), D472Y, and H482N strains during the three replicate competition experiments from which the average values in panel A were derived.\n\nIn the multiallele competition experiment conducted in SMMAsn, each of the 18 strains was initially present at 5 to 6% of the total population (Fig. 5A). As seen earlier in the multiallele competition performed in LB medium (Fig. 3), most of the strains carrying variousrpoBmutations dropped out of the population during the course of propagation in SMMAsn(Fig. 5A). Interestingly, in this experiment, we observed that the strain carrying the H482NrpoBmutation rose to dominate the population, gaining an average frequency of 70% by generation 49, followed by the strain carrying the D472Y mutation (20%) and then the wild type strain (10%) (Fig. 5A). These results were in stark contrast to those obtained in LB medium, where the wild type strain dominated the population, with the H482N mutant forming a minority (Fig. 3). Interestingly, the strain carrying the S487L mutation, which we predicted would become the most frequent allele, did not succeed in this medium as we had expected but, rather, dropped below the threshold of detection in the population by generation 14 of the competition (Fig. 5A). Comparison of the results presented inFig. 3with the results inFig. 5demonstrated a dramatic difference in the population dynamics and strain fitness of the samerpoBmutants depending upon whether they were competed in the rich LB or the minimal SMMAsnenvironment. In addition, the lack of increased competitive fitness displayed by the S487LrpoBmutant competed in SMMAsn(Fig. 5A) brought into question whether an increased utilization of a nutrient, such asl asparagine, as measured by Omnilog assay (8), is a relevant parameter to predict fitness.\n\nDuring multiallele competition in LB medium, we noted that the A478DrpoBmutant rose to prominence in one of the three replicate cultures (Fig. 3D), presumably due to a second site mutation(s). Accordingly, we also examined the frequencies of the wild type, D472Y, and H482N strains in each individual SMMAsnculture (Fig. 5BtoD). In this case, all three cultures behaved similarly, with the H482N strain arising to dominate each of the three cultures. This observation suggested that no second site mutation(s) improving fitness had arisen in the SMMAsncultures during the course of the multiallele competition experiment.\n\nWe sought to further explore the role played by growth rate in the fitness ofrpoBmutants by measuring the exponential growth rates during cultivation in SMMAsnof the wild typeB. subtilisstrain and congenic mutant strains harboring the D472Y, H482N, or S487LrpoBallele (Fig. 6). In individual SMMAsnmonocultures, all three Rifrmutant strains exhibited a significantly increased exponential growth rate compared to the growth rate of the wild type strain, but there were no statistical differences among the growth rates of the Rifrmutants themselves (Fig. 6A). These results were distinctly different from the relative growth rates of the same strains in LB medium, in which therpoBmutants either grew more slowly (S487L) or at essentially the same rate (D472Y and H482N) as the wild type (Fig. 2). If the exponential growth rate were the sole determinant of fitness, it would be expected that the three Rifrmutants would have risen to dominate the multiallele competition experiment performed in SMMAsn, but this was clearly not the case (Fig. 5).\n\nExponential growth rates (A) and lag times (B) in SMMAsnof the wild type (w.t.) strain and congenicrpoBmutant strains carrying the D472Y, H482N, and S487L variants. Data are averages +/  standard deviations (n=3). **,P<0.01; ***,P<0.001 (ordinary one way ANOVA with Dunnett's test for multiple comparison to the mean value for the wild type).\n\nIn addition to the exponential growth rate, the ability of cells to adjust to a new environment is reflected in the lag time preceding exponential growth. In one of the few studies examining this phenomenon inrpoBmutants, it was observed that aMycobacterium tuberculosisRifrmutant strain carrying an H526D substitution (the equivalent of the H482D substitution inB. subtilisrpoB) suffered significantly delayed growth following resuscitation from nutrient starvation (29). We thus compared the lag time of the wild type strain to the lag times of congenic strains carrying the D472Y, H482N, and S487LrpoBvariants in SMMAsn. No significant difference was observed in the lag times between the wild type and the D472Y variant; however, both the H482N and S487L variants demonstrated significant increases in lag time relative to that of the wild type (Fig. 6B). In fact, the H482N and S487L variants were statistically indistinguishable in their growth rates (increased over that of the wild type) and lag times (longer than that of the wild type). Taken together, the results shown inFig. 6indicated that in SMMAsnmedium, the growth rate and/or lag time of individual monocultures corresponded poorly with increased or decreased relative fitness in competition experiments.\n\nTo further examine the discrepancies between the observed growth metrics and the results of our multiallele competition, we performed a pairwise competition for each Rifrmutant strain against the wild type strain in both LB and SMMAsnmedia (Fig. 7). The H482N Rifrmutant strain showed the most dramatic fitness difference compared to the fitness of the wild type; it was less fit in LB (S=  0.047+/ 0.01) but more fit (S= +0.403+/ 0.063) in SMMAsnmedium (Fig. 7). The S487L mutant was less fit than the wild type in both media, although its fitness in SMMAsn(S=  0.144+/ 0.005) was significantly improved over that in LB (S=  0.337+/ 0.01) (Fig. 7). The D472Y mutant was also less fit than the wild type in both media, but the difference in its fitness between the two media was just above the cutoff for significance (P=0.061). Measurements of the relative fitness for each mutantrpoBallele in pairwise competition agreed with the results of the multiallelic competitions in SMMAsn.\n\nPairwise competition experiments. Rifrstrains carrying the variant D472Y (strain WN1625), H482N (strain WN1637), or S487L (strain WN761) were each competed against congenic wild type strain WN1651 in LB or SMMAsnmedium for 21 generations, and fitness coefficients (S) were calculated as described previously (54). Data are average values +/  standard deviations (n=3). ***,P<0.001; ****,P<0.0001; ns, not significantly different (two way ANOVA with Tukey's HSD test for multiple comparisons).\n\nPrevious work in our laboratory has shown differing spectra of mutations in therpoBgene across several different environment (12,13,16 18). The reproducibility of these changes in the spectra of mutations indicates that the environment somehow dictates these changes. Multiple studies have found that mutations in therpoBgene that confer rifampin resistance can provide a fitness advantage or increased growth rate in the environment from which they were isolated. Several examples illustrate the repeated occurrence ofrpoBmutations in adaptive laboratory evolution ofEscherichia coli, wherein these mutations significantly increased the fitness of the organism in different environments, including optimized growth on various minimal media and increased fitness at elevated temperatures (30 32).\n\nOur multiallele, multigenerational competition experiments (Fig. 3and5) showed that the wild typerpoBallele was most fit in nutrient rich LB medium, while the H482N variant was most fit in populations cultivated in minimal SMMAsnmedium. The differentrpoBalleles and the corresponding changes in global gene expression associated with them likely explain the differences in relative fitness depending upon the growth environment. Numerous studies suggest changes in global gene expression to be the cause of changes in fitness observed with mutations inrpoB(7,33 37), although one study examining the system wide impacts of mutations in thePseudomonas aeruginosarpoBgene found few differences in global gene expression and attributed mutant phenotypes to increased expression of RNAP (38). Ultimately, a better understanding of the specific mechanisms behind these differences in fitness will require an examination of global gene expression of these differentrpoBalleles in SMMAsn.\n\nWhich changes in gene expression are specifically responsible for the success of the H482N mutant can only be speculated upon at present, as this particular allele is new to our collection and not yet very well characterized. However, the lack of fitness of the S487L mutant in SMMAsnmay be a bit easier to explain. Previous work studying therpoB S487L allele inB. subtilisrevealed that this particular allele autoinduced the expression of genes responsible for the production of the antibiotic 3,3 neotrehalosadiamine (NTD), which is not produced by the wild type strain under the same conditions (39). This autoinduction of NTD production might place a significant metabolic burden on the organism and may be responsible for the lack of relative fitness observed in therpoB S487L allele.\n\nThe discrepancies between fitness and exponential growth rate reveal that, while fairly simple to determine, growth rate is a poor proxy for relative fitness, as a similar study has found (40). Simply measuring the exponential growth rate fails to account for differences in fitness during stationary and lag phase, in addition to potential antagonistic or cooperative interactions between the strains when competing for the same resources, such as dramatic acidification of the medium (41). Our study highlights the danger of conflating exponential growth rates or results from simplified metabolic assays (8) with relative fitness. Three RifrrpoBvariants exhibited an increased growth rate relative to the growth rate of the wild type strain in SMMAsn(Fig. 6); however, only one of those variants (H482N) proved to be more fit than the wild type strain in the same medium (Fig. 7). There are many potential explanations for this discrepancy that could be controlled at the transcriptional level, such as increased probability of differentiation in the stationary phase (42) or shaping of the environment by an evolved variant in a manner that preferentially benefits itself (41,43).\n\nUnlike other results from this study, the increased relative fitness of the evolved strain WN1663 cannot be explained solely by a compensatory mutation inrpoB(Fig. 4). Our data indicate that other changes within theB. subtilisgenome must account for the observed sweep of the population by WN1663. The increase in fitness of the A478D+I528V double mutant relative to the fitness of the A478D single mutant is consistent with other studies that have reported the ability of compensatory mutations inrpoBandrpoCto restore fitness defects (44 46). However, these studies did not find increases in fitness relative to that of the wild type allele. In summary, this study illustrates the fitness impacts ofrpoBalleles in different environments, highlights the deficiencies of growth or metabolic metrics of monocultures as a sole measure of relative fitness, and demonstrates the role of compensatory mutations inrpoBto recover fitness cost.",
    "discussion": "Levels of Rif resistance conferred by mutant rpoB alleles. The natural environment often contains inhibitory or subinhibitory levels of various antibiotics; thus, natural antibiotic resistance would confer a selective advantage in such environments (reviewed in reference 25 ). Through our studies of Rif r over the years, we have amassed a collection of congenic B. subtilis strains, each carrying 1 of 17 different Rif r mutations in rpoB ( Table 1 ). We measured the levels of Rif r in these strains by measuring the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) for Rif in LB medium by the broth dilution method ( Fig. 1 ). As expected, the wild type laboratory strain was very sensitive to Rif (IC 50 of 0.06+/ 0.01ug/mL). All mutant rpoB alleles that had been selected on a high concentration of Rif (50ug/mL) ( 12 , 13 ) exhibited high IC 50 values of >100ug/mL, whereas mutant rpoB alleles selected on a low concentration of Rif (5ug/mL) ( 17 ) exhibited generally lower IC 50 values, ranging from 4 to 84ug/mL, the lowest of which was still at least 67 fold higher than that of the wild type strain ( Fig. 1 ). Thus, in the context of growth in a selective environment containing Rif, all the Rif r rpoB mutants would be expected to be more fit than the wild type strain. TABLE 1.

Results are presented as averages +/  standard deviations ( n =3). w.t., wild type.\n\nGrowth rates of rpoB mutants in LB cultures. In the absence of Rif selection, it has been noted previously that mutations in rpoB leading to Rif r often exert a fitness cost, such as a lower growth rate as measured in standard laboratory media ( 26 ; reviewed in reference 27 ). To test this notion, we measured the growth rates of wild type B. subtilis and 17 congenic rpoB mutants in individual liquid LB shake flask cultures ( Fig. 2 ). It was observed that 10 of the 17 rpoB mutant strains grew significantly more slowly than the wild type ( Fig. 2 ), consistent with the notion that rpoB mutations can exert a fitness cost ( 26 ). However, 8 of the 17 rpoB mutants grew at a rate statistically indistinguishable from that of the wild type strain ( Fig. 2 ). The results indicate that not all Rif r mutants exhibit lowered fitness in LB under standard laboratory conditions, as measured by growth rate. FIG 2. Open in a new tab Growth rates of B. subtilis strains cultivated in liquid LB in shake flasks with aeration.

The growth rate experiments described above were performed on individual strains in monoculture, which may not reflect their true fitness in a complex competitive environment such as would likely prevail in nature. Therefore, to directly compare the fitness of rpoB alleles, we performed, in triplicate cultures, a multigenerational and multistrain competition experiment in which the wild type strain and all 17 Rif r rpoB mutant strains were competed simultaneously in LB ( Fig. 3 ). At daily (7 generation) intervals, the proportion of each rpoB allele in the mixed population was determined by next generation sequencing of two 500 bp PCR amplicons spanning either the N cluster or clusters I, II, and III of the rpoB gene ( Fig. 3A ). At generation zero of the experiment, each rpoB allele was present at 5 to 6% of the total population. By generation 35, the wild type strain came to dominate all three cultures, and the proportion of most Rif r mutant alleles had dropped below the level of detection (0.1%) ( Fig. 3A ). Two Rif r rpoB mutants persisted until the end of the experiment, the H482N and A478D variants. Although the growth rate of the H482N mutant was not significantly higher than that of the wild type strain when grown separately in monoculture ( Fig. 2 ), the mutant appeared to be less fit in a competitive environment ( Fig. 3A ). Interestingly, the A478D mutant appeared to almost disappear from the population by 14 generations, but beginning at 35 generations, it increased again in frequency to an average of 25% of the population by generation 49 ( Fig. 3A ). This anomalous result prompted us to more closely examine the allelic frequencies of the wild type, H482N, and A478D strains in each of the three replicate mixed cultures. We observed that in two of the three replicate cultures, the A478D allele behaved like the majority of the Rif r rpoB mutations, becoming reduced to a very low, barely detectable frequency ( Fig. 3B and C ). In contrast, in the third culture, the A478D mutant initially dropped below the limit of detection (0.1%), but then starting at generation 35, it increased dramatically in frequency to comprise over 80% of that population by generation 49 ( Fig. 3D ). Closer examination of the PCR amplicon spanning clusters I, II, and III from the A478D mutant arising after generation 35 in the third culture revealed the appearance of a second mutation in rpoB , I528V. Furthermore, Sanger sequencing of the rpoB gene of a Rif r isolate from this culture, strain WN1663, confirmed the presence of the I528V mutation in addition to the original A478D mutation. These observations led us to suspect that during the competition experiment in the third culture, the original A478D strain had suffered a second site mutation in rpoB , dramatically increasing its competitive fitness. To determine if this compensatory mutation was responsible for the observed increase in relative fitness, both the ancestral (A478D) and evolved (A478D+I528V) alleles were transferred into a clean wild type background to create strains WN1658 and WN1662, respectively. To test their competitive fitness, the four congenic strains WN1621 (wild type), WN1658 (A478D), WN1663 (evolved A478+I528V, isolated from the generation 49 culture of the experiment whose results are shown in Fig. 3D ), and WN1662 (A478D+I528V, reconstructed in a wild type background) were each competed separately against the same isogenic wild type strain (strain WN624, carrying a spectinomycin resistance [Spc r ] marker) in LB medium ( Fig. 4 ). Pairwise competition experiments showed that strain WN1658, the A478D rpoB mutant, was dramatically less fit than the wild type (selection coefficient [ S ] =  1.26+/ 0.35), whereas the evolved isolate strain WN1663 (A478D+I528V) was dramatically more fit than the wild type ( S = +0.84+/ 0.23) ( Fig. 4 ). However, simple reconstruction of the A478D+I528V rpoB double mutation in an otherwise wild type background (strain WN1662) resulted in only a modest increase in fitness ( S =  0.47+/ 0.05) compared to that seen in the single A478D mutant and failed to replicate the dramatic increase in fitness seen in the evolved strain WN1663 ( Fig. 4 ). We therefore conclude that while the second site mutation I528V in rpoB increased competitive fitness to a certain extent, it was not sufficient to account for the dramatic increase in fitness seen in strain 1663 arising in the third multiallelic competition culture in the experiment whose results are shown in Fig. 3D . The results lead us to hypothesize that strain WN1663 had sustained genomic mutation(s) in addition to I528V that also contributed to its dramatically increased fitness. These putative additional mutations could be revealed by whole genome sequencing, which is beyond the scope of the present study. Results from the experiment whose results are shown in Fig. 3 indicated that, when challenged in a more complex competitive environment (18 rpoB variants growing together for 49 generation in LB medium in the absence of Rif selection), all of the Rif r mutations in rpoB led to a generalized reduction in fitness. This result is somewhat at odds with the conclusions drawn from measurements of growth rates of the same strains in monoculture ( Fig. 2 ), indicating that fitness cannot be predicted by growth rate in monoculture alone.

The multiallele competition experiment whose results are shown in Fig. 3 was performed in nutrient rich LB medium. However, in nature, B. subtilis is found in soils or associated with plants and their roots. Such natural environments are either subjected to \"feast or famine\" conditions or are chronically oligotrophic; therefore, cells would need to utilize limited quantities of rarer, more ephemeral nutrient sources. In previous work, we performed OmniLog global metabolic profiling on wild type B. subtilis and 11 Rif r rpoB mutants to assess how mutations in rpoB could affect metabolic capabilities ( 8 ). Indeed, we found that several environmental nutrients, normally utilized poorly by the wild type laboratory strain of B. subtilis , were used significantly better by certain Rif r rpoB mutants. In particular, we noted that a strain carrying the S487L rpoB substitution utilized the amino acids l  alanine, l  asparagine, l  glutamate, and l  serine significantly better than the wild type ( 8 ). l  Asparagine specifically has been found to be substantially present in root exudates and plays a significant role in determining the bacterial species composition of the rhizosphere ( 28 ). Based on these observations, we were interested in measuring the relative fitness of wild type and 17 Rif r rpoB mutant strains of B. subtilis in a more stringent selective environment. We therefore modified Spizizen minimal medium by replacing glucose with l  asparagine as the sole carbon source (SMM Asn ; see Materials and Methods for details) and again performed a multiallele, multigenerational competition experiment ( Fig. 5 ). Based on its performance in OmniLog metabolic assays ( 8 ), we reasoned that the S487L mutant would fare better in this more stringent environment than the wild type or other Rif r mutant strains. FIG 5. Open in a new tab (A) Population dynamics of wild type (WT) and 17 rpoB mutant strains of B. subtilis in SMM Asn liquid medium grown with aeration at 37 degreesC. Data shown are average values ( n =3). (B to D) Population dynamics of wild type (WT), D472Y, and H482N strains during the three replicate competition experiments from which the average values in panel A were derived. In the multiallele competition experiment conducted in SMM Asn , each of the 18 strains was initially present at 5 to 6% of the total population ( Fig. 5A ). As seen earlier in the multiallele competition performed in LB medium ( Fig. 3 ), most of the strains carrying various rpoB mutations dropped out of the population during the course of propagation in SMM Asn ( Fig. 5A ). Interestingly, in this experiment, we observed that the strain carrying the H482N rpoB mutation rose to dominate the population, gaining an average frequency of 70% by generation 49, followed by the strain carrying the D472Y mutation (20%) and then the wild type strain (10%) ( Fig. 5A ). These results were in stark contrast to those obtained in LB medium, where the wild type strain dominated the population, with the H482N mutant forming a minority ( Fig. 3 ). Interestingly, the strain carrying the S487L mutation, which we predicted would become the most frequent allele, did not succeed in this medium as we had expected but, rather, dropped below the threshold of detection in the population by generation 14 of the competition ( Fig. 5A ). Comparison of the results presented in Fig. 3 with the results in Fig. 5 demonstrated a dramatic difference in the population dynamics and strain fitness of the same rpoB mutants depending upon whether they were competed in the rich LB or the minimal SMM Asn environment. In addition, the lack of increased competitive fitness displayed by the S487L rpoB mutant competed in SMM Asn ( Fig. 5A ) brought into question whether an increased utilization of a nutrient, such as l  asparagine, as measured by Omnilog assay ( 8 ), is a relevant parameter to predict fitness. During multiallele competition in LB medium, we noted that the A478D rpoB mutant rose to prominence in one of the three replicate cultures ( Fig. 3D ), presumably due to a second site mutation(s). Accordingly, we also examined the frequencies of the wild type, D472Y, and H482N strains in each individual SMM Asn culture ( Fig. 5B to D ). In this case, all three cultures behaved similarly, with the H482N strain arising to dominate each of the three cultures. This observation suggested that no second site mutation(s) improving fitness had arisen in the SMM Asn cultures during the course of the multiallele competition experiment.\n\nGrowth rates and lag times of rpoB mutations in SMM Asn cultures. We sought to further explore the role played by growth rate in the fitness of rpoB mutants by measuring the exponential growth rates during cultivation in SMM Asn of the wild type B. subtilis strain and congenic mutant strains harboring the D472Y, H482N, or S487L rpoB allele ( Fig. 6 ). In individual SMM Asn monocultures, all three Rif r mutant strains exhibited a significantly increased exponential growth rate compared to the growth rate of the wild type strain, but there were no statistical differences among the growth rates of the Rif r mutants themselves ( Fig. 6A ). These results were distinctly different from the relative growth rates of the same strains in LB medium, in which the rpoB mutants either grew more slowly (S487L) or at essentially the same rate (D472Y and H482N) as the wild type ( Fig. 2 ). If the exponential growth rate were the sole determinant of fitness, it would be expected that the three Rif r mutants would have risen to dominate the multiallele competition experiment performed in SMM Asn , but this was clearly not the case ( Fig. 5 ). FIG 6. Open in a new tab Exponential growth rates (A) and lag times (B) in SMM Asn of the wild type (w.t.) strain and congenic rpoB mutant strains carrying the D472Y, H482N, and S487L variants. Data are averages +/  standard deviations ( n =3). **, P< 0.01; ***, P< 0.001 (ordinary one way ANOVA with Dunnett's test for multiple comparison to the mean value for the wild type). In addition to the exponential growth rate, the ability of cells to adjust to a new environment is reflected in the lag time preceding exponential growth. In one of the few studies examining this phenomenon in rpoB mutants, it was observed that a Mycobacterium tuberculosis Rif r mutant strain carrying an H526D substitution (the equivalent of the H482D substitution in B. subtilis rpoB ) suffered significantly delayed growth following resuscitation from nutrient starvation ( 29 ). We thus compared the lag time of the wild type strain to the lag times of congenic strains carrying the D472Y, H482N, and S487L rpoB variants in SMM Asn . No significant difference was observed in the lag times between the wild type and the D472Y variant; however, both the H482N and S487L variants demonstrated significant increases in lag time relative to that of the wild type ( Fig. 6B ). In fact, the H482N and S487L variants were statistically indistinguishable in their growth rates (increased over that of the wild type) and lag times (longer than that of the wild type). Taken together, the results shown in Fig. 6 indicated that in SMM Asn medium, the growth rate and/or lag time of individual monocultures corresponded poorly with increased or decreased relative fitness in competition experiments.\n\nPairwise competitions in LB versus SMM Asn . To further examine the discrepancies between the observed growth metrics and the results of our multiallele competition, we performed a pairwise competition for each Rif r mutant strain against the wild type strain in both LB and SMM Asn media ( Fig. 7 ). The H482N Rif r mutant strain showed the most dramatic fitness difference compared to the fitness of the wild type; it was less fit in LB ( S =  0.047+/ 0.01) but more fit ( S = +0.403+/ 0.063) in SMM Asn medium ( Fig. 7 ). The S487L mutant was less fit than the wild type in both media, although its fitness in SMM Asn ( S =  0.144+/ 0.005) was significantly improved over that in LB ( S =  0.337+/ 0.01) ( Fig. 7 ). The D472Y mutant was also less fit than the wild type in both media, but the difference in its fitness between the two media was just above the cutoff for significance ( P= 0.061). Measurements of the relative fitness for each mutant rpoB allele in pairwise competition agreed with the results of the multiallelic competitions in SMM Asn . FIG 7. Open in a new tab Pairwise competition experiments. Rif r strains carrying the variant D472Y (strain WN1625), H482N (strain WN1637), or S487L (strain WN761) were each competed against congenic wild type strain WN1651 in LB or SMM Asn medium for 21 generations, and fitness coefficients ( S ) were calculated as described previously ( 54 ). Data are average values +/  standard deviations ( n =3). ***, P< 0.001; ****, P< 0.0001; ns, not significantly different (two way ANOVA with Tukey's HSD test for multiple comparisons). Previous work in our laboratory has shown differing spectra of mutations in the rpoB gene across several different environment ( 12 , 13 , 16   18 ). The reproducibility of these changes in the spectra of mutations indicates that the environment somehow dictates these changes. Multiple studies have found that mutations in the rpoB gene that confer rifampin resistance can provide a fitness advantage or increased growth rate in the environment from which they were isolated. Several examples illustrate the repeated occurrence of rpoB mutations in adaptive laboratory evolution of Escherichia coli , wherein these mutations significantly increased the fitness of the organism in different environments, including optimized growth on various minimal media and increased fitness at elevated temperatures ( 30   32 ). Our multiallele, multigenerational competition experiments ( Fig. 3 and 5 ) showed that the wild type rpoB allele was most fit in nutrient rich LB medium, while the H482N variant was most fit in populations cultivated in minimal SMM Asn medium. The different rpoB alleles and the corresponding changes in global gene expression associated with them likely explain the differences in relative fitness depending upon the growth environment. Numerous studies suggest changes in global gene expression to be the cause of changes in fitness observed with mutations in rpoB ( 7 , 33   37 ), although one study examining the system wide impacts of mutations in the Pseudomonas aeruginosa rpoB gene found few differences in global gene expression and attributed mutant phenotypes to increased expression of RNAP ( 38 ). Ultimately, a better understanding of the specific mechanisms behind these differences in fitness will require an examination of global gene expression of these different rpoB alleles in SMM Asn . Which changes in gene expression are specifically responsible for the success of the H482N mutant can only be speculated upon at present, as this particular allele is new to our collection and not yet very well characterized. However, the lack of fitness of the S487L mutant in SMM Asn may be a bit easier to explain. Previous work studying the rpoB  S487L allele in B. subtilis revealed that this particular allele autoinduced the expression of genes responsible for the production of the antibiotic 3,3 neotrehalosadiamine (NTD), which is not produced by the wild type strain under the same conditions ( 39 ). This autoinduction of NTD production might place a significant metabolic burden on the organism and may be responsible for the lack of relative fitness observed in the rpoB  S487L allele. The discrepancies between fitness and exponential growth rate reveal that, while fairly simple to determine, growth rate is a poor proxy for relative fitness, as a similar study has found ( 40 ). Simply measuring the exponential growth rate fails to account for differences in fitness during stationary and lag phase, in addition to potential antagonistic or cooperative interactions between the strains when competing for the same resources, such as dramatic acidification of the medium ( 41 ). Our study highlights the danger of conflating exponential growth rates or results from simplified metabolic assays ( 8 ) with relative fitness. Three Rif r rpoB variants exhibited an increased growth rate relative to the growth rate of the wild type strain in SMM Asn ( Fig. 6 ); however, only one of those variants (H482N) proved to be more fit than the wild type strain in the same medium ( Fig. 7 ). There are many potential explanations for this discrepancy that could be controlled at the transcriptional level, such as increased probability of differentiation in the stationary phase ( 42 ) or shaping of the environment by an evolved variant in a manner that preferentially benefits itself ( 41 , 43 ). Unlike other results from this study, the increased relative fitness of the evolved strain WN1663 cannot be explained solely by a compensatory mutation in rpoB ( Fig. 4 ). Our data indicate that other changes within the B. subtilis genome must account for the observed sweep of the population by WN1663. The increase in fitness of the A478D+I528V double mutant relative to the fitness of the A478D single mutant is consistent with other studies that have reported the ability of compensatory mutations in rpoB and rpoC to restore fitness defects ( 44   46 ). However, these studies did not find increases in fitness relative to that of the wild type allele. In summary, this study illustrates the fitness impacts of rpoB alleles in different environments, highlights the deficiencies of growth or metabolic metrics of monocultures as a sole measure of relative fitness, and demonstrates the role of compensatory mutations in rpoB to recover fitness cost.",
