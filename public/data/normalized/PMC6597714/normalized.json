    "abstract": "Based on body weight, morbidly obese leptin deficientob/obmice have less bone than expected, suggesting that leptin plays a role in the skeletal response to weight bearing. To evaluate this possibility, we compared the skeletal response of wild type (WT) andob/obmice to hindlimb unloading (HU). Mice were individually housed at 32 degreesC (thermoneutral) from 4 weeks of age (rapidly growing) to 16 weeks of age (approaching skeletal maturity). Mice were then randomized into one of 4 groups (n=10/group): (1) WT control, (2) WT HU, (3)ob/obcontrol, and (4)ob/obHU and the results analyzed by 2 way ANOVA.ob/obmice pair fed to WT mice had normal cancellous bone volume fraction (BV/TV) in distal femur, lower femur length and total bone area, mineral content (BMC) and density (BMD), and higher cancellous bone volume fraction in lumbar vertebra (LV). HU resulted in lower BMC and BMD in total femur, and lower BV/TV in distal femur and LV in both genotypes. Cancellous bone loss in femur in both genotypes was associated with increases in osteoclast lined bone perimeter. In summary, leptin deficiency did not attenuate HU induced osteopenia in male mice, suggesting that leptin is not required for bone loss induced by unweighting.\n\nSubject terms:Physiology, Endocrinology",
    "methods": "The animals were maintained in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the Oregon State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved the experimental protocol.\n\nFour week old male C57BL/6J (WT, n=20) mice and B6.Lepob/ob(ob/ob, n=20) mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and single housed in a 32 degreesC room for the duration of the experiment. Housing mice at 32 degreesC (thermoneutral temperature) minimizes resting energy expenditure74,75and prevents premature cancellous bone loss associated with cold stress induced by sub thermoneutral housing49. Water was providedad libitumto all animals for the duration of study.ob/obmice were pair fed to WT mice from 4 to 16 weeks of age to minimize differences in weight gain16. At 16 weeks of age, the mice were randomized by body weight into one of four treatment groups (n=10/group): (1) WT control, (2) WT HU, (3)ob/obcontrol, and (4)ob/obHU. Immediately prior to HU, animals were given a declomycin injection (15mg/kg; sc). The mice were unloaded for 2 weeks as described21. In brief, HU mice were placed in a restraint device, where the tail was cleaned with ethanol soaked gauze and sprayed with a tincture of benzoin. A thin piece of traction tape was looped through a large paper clip, and then pressed along the sides of the mouse's tail. Filament tape was wrapped around the tail in two locations to secure the traction tape: the base of the tail and 2.5cm caudal. The paperclip end was looped through the clasp secured on the unloading apparatus. Mice were positioned in a 30 degrees head down tilt. During unloading, theob/obHU group and control groups of both genotypes were pair fed to the WT HU group. The fluorochrome calcein (15mg/kg; sc) was administered at 4 days and 1day prior to sacrifice. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and terminated using decapitation. Blood was collected from the trunk following decapitation. Serum was stored at  80 degreesC. Femora and 5thlumbar vertebrae from each mouse were placed in formalin for 24 hour fixation, then stored at 4 degreesC in 70% ethanol. Body weight (g), abdominal WAT weight (g) and seminal vesicle weight (g) were recorded at necropsy.\n\nBlood glucose was measured using a glucometer (Life Scan, Inc., Milpitas, CA, USA) immediately following decapitation. Serum corticosterone (ng/ml) and osteocalcin (ng/ml) were measured using a mouse Corticosterone ELISA kit obtained from Abcam (Cambridge, MA, USA) and a mouse Gla osteocalcin High Sensitive EIA kit obtained from Clontech (Takara Bio Inc Shiga, Japan), respectively.\n\nTotal femur bone mineral content (BMC, g), bone area (cm2), and bone mineral density (BMD, g/cm2) were measured using dual energy x ray absorptiometry (DXA, Piximus 2, Lunar Corporation, Madison, WI, USA).\n\nuCT was used for nondestructive three dimensional evaluation of total femur bone volume (mm3), femur length (mm), and cortical and cancellous bone architecture. Femora were scanned using a Scanco uCT40 scanner (Scanco Medical AG, Basserdorf, Switzerland) at a voxel size of 12umx12umx12um (55 kVpx ray voltage, 145uA intensity, and 200ms integration time). Filtering parameters sigma and support were set to 0.8 and 1, respectively. The threshold value for evaluation was determined empirically and set at 245 (gray scale, 0 1000). Cortical bone was evaluated in the femoral diaphysis and cancellous bone was evaluated in the distal femur metaphysis and epiphysis (Fig.3).\n\nAssessment of cortical bone in the femur diaphysis began 60% down the midshaft from the femoral head and consisted of 20 slices (240um in length). Automated contouring was used to delineate cortical bone from the marrow cavity. All cortical slices were visually examined for evidence of cancellous struts originating from the endocortex and manually removed when present. Direct cortical bone measurements included total cross sectional volume (mm3), cortical volume (mm3), marrow volume (mm3), and cortical thickness (um). Polar moment of inertia (mm4) was determined as a surrogate measure of bone strength in torsion.\n\nAssessment of cancellous bone in the distal femur metaphysis began 45 slices (540um in length) proximal to the growth plate, and included 40 slices (480um in length) of cancellous bone. The entire cancellous bone compartment was evaluated in the distal femur epiphysis (31+/ 1 slices) and 5thlumbar vertebral body (149+/ 1 slices). Direct cancellous bone measurements included bone volume fraction (bone volume/tissue volume; volume of total tissue occupied by cancellous bone, %), connectivity density (number of redundant connections per unit volume, 1/mm3), structure model index (an architectural index defining bone as plate like or rod like with values ranging from 0 to 3, respectively), trabecular thickness (mean thickness of individual trabeculae, um), trabecular number (number of trabecular intercepts per unit length, 1/mm) and trabecular spacing (distance between trabeculae, um).\n\nThe histological methods used have been previously described in detail76. In brief, distal femora were dehydrated in graded increases of ethanol and xylene, then embedded undecalcified in methyl methacrylate. Sections, 4um thick, were cut with a vertical bed microtome (Leica/Jung 2165) and affixed to slides with a dried pre coated 1% gelatin solution. Slides were stained for tartrate resistant acid phosphatase and counterstained with toluidine blue (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and used for cell based measurements. Mounted unstained slides were used for measurements of fluorochrome labels. All data were collected using the OsteoMeasure System (OsteoMetrics, Inc., Atlanta, GA, USA). The sampling site for the distal femoral metaphysis was located 0.25 1.25mm proximal to the growth plate.\n\nStatic (cell based) histological measurements include osteoblast perimeter (osteoblast perimeter/bone perimeter; %), osteoclast perimeter (osteoclast perimeter/bone perimeter; %), bone marrow adiposity (adipocyte area/tissue area; %), adipocyte density (#/mm2), and adipocyte size (um2). Osteoblast perimeter was determined as a percentage of total bone perimeter lined by cuboidal cells adjacent to a thin layer of osteoid in direct physical contact with bone. Osteoclast perimeter was determined as a percentage of cancellous bone perimeter covered by multinucleated cells with an acid phosphatase positive (stained red) cytoplasm. Adipocytes were identified as large circular or oval shaped cells bordered by a prominent cell membrane lacking cytoplasmic staining due to alcohol extraction of intracellular lipids during processing77. Fluorochrome based measurements of cancellous bone formation included mineralizing perimeter (mineralizing perimeter/bone perimeter: perimeter covered with double label plus half single label, normalized to bone perimeter, %), mineral apposition rate (the distance between double calcein labels, divided by the 3day interlabel period, um/day), and bone formation rate (mineralizing perimeter multiplied by mineral apposition rate expressed per bone perimeter (um2/um/y).\n\nRetained declomycin label (single label perimeter/tissue area; mm/mm2) in the distal femur metaphysis was measured as a dynamic index of bone resorption. This method is based on the premise that treatment groups did not differ in bone formation (and as such fluorochrome label incorporation) prior to HU35and that differences measured at the study termination reflect the effect of treatment on resorption of the fluorochrome labeled bone78.\n\nMeans were compared between genotype and treatment groups using two way analysis of variance (ANOVA). When significant interactions were present, t tests were used to make two group comparisons. When non significant interactions were present, group comparisons were made from two way ANOVA with main effects for genotype and treatment. The required conditions for valid use of t tests and ANOVA were assessed using Levene's test for homogeneity of variance and the Anderson Darling test of normality. When the assumption of equal variance was violated, Welch's two sample t test was used for two group comparisons79. When the normality assumption was violated, the Wilcoxon Mann Whitney test was used for two group comparisons. Methods for maintaining false discovery rate at 5% were used to adjust for multiple comparisons80. Differences were considered significant at p<=0.05. Data are presented as mean +/  SEM. Data analysis was performed using RStudio version 0.98.1083.",

    "discussion": "We evaluated the skeletal response to HU in leptin deficientob/obmale mice. Based on the observation that leptin deficiency attenuates the positive association between body weight and bone mass (e.g., more weight gain is required inob/obmice compared to WT mice to achieve a comparable increase in bone mass), we hypothesized thatob/obmice would exhibit diminished bone loss in response to HU. However, contrary to our expectations, the magnitude of HU induced osteopenia inob/obmice in femur, a weight bearing bone, was virtually indistinguishable from that of WT mice. In concordance with previous studies in WT mice, cancellous bone loss in HU mice housed at thermoneutral was due to increased bone resorption. The increase in bone resorption was due, at least in part, to increased osteoclast lined bone perimeter24.\n\nLeptin has differential effects on osteoclast number and activity in weight bearing mice.ob/obmice have normal or increased osteoclast lined bone perimeter25,26, indicating that the hormone is not required for osteoclastogenesis. Indeed, subcutaneous administration of leptin attenuates ovariectomy  and HU induced bone loss in rats by reducing osteoclast number3,27. On the other hand, several lines of evidence suggest reduced osteoclast activity inob/obmice. Specifically,ob/obmice have low serum levels of CTX, a biochemical marker of global bone resorption20,26. In spite of elevated osteoclast lined bone perimeter, resorption of declomycin is diminished in femurs ofob/obmice16. Furthermore,ob/obmice are resistant to polyethylene particle induced osteolysis28. Finally,ob/obmice have impaired ability to remodel the calcified cartilage network in growing femur, leading to pathological retention of cartilage during skeletal maturation10,16,26.\n\nIn the present study, bone resorption was increased in femur metaphysis inob/oband WT mice in response to HU. In support, we observed an increase in osteoclast lined bone perimeter. Furthermore, we observed decreases in cancellous bone volume fraction and fluorochrome label retention. Specifically, declomycin label given at the start of the study was lower after two weeks of HU compared to weight bearing mice, indicating greater resorption of fluorochrome labeled bone occurred with HU. This association between unloading and label loss is in agreement with previous spaceflight and HU studies in rats29. HU for two weeks had no significant effect on body composition in WT orob/obmice. This is important because changes in weight could independently influence bone turnover balance30. Thus, contrary to our expectation, skeletal unloading enhanced bone resorption in leptin deficient mice.\n\nReduced bone formation contributes to development of osteopenia in growing rodents during microgravity (spaceflight) and simulated microgravity (HU)31,32. However, suppression of bone formation is bone compartment specific. In HU mice, cortical bone formation is suppressed33, but this is not necessarily the case for cancellous skeletal sites24. In the present study, osteoblast perimeter and bone formation rate were not reduced in distal femur in WT orob/obmice during HU. Taken together, these observations suggest that HU results in cancellous bone loss in the distal femur metaphysis because resorption increases to levels that exceed the prevailing level of bone formation.\n\nIn addition to femur, we evaluated the respective effects of leptin deficiency and HU on lumbar vertebra. Cancellous bone loss occurs in lumbar vertebra in rodents subjected to microgravity34and the bone loss is due, at least in part, to increased bone resorption35. Femurs experience high levels of ground reaction forces in response to weight bearing, and these forces are abolished by HU. Lumbar vertebrae do not generally bear weight in mice. However, lumbar vertebrae are load bearing and HU alters the orientation of the vertebral column to the gravitational vector, changing the direction of the load36. Similar to femur, leptin deficiency did not prevent HU induced cancellous bone loss in lumbar vertebra. While there were no genotype specific differences in magnitude of cancellous bone loss in lumbar vertebra of HU mice, the bone loss in WT mice was due to a combination of decreased trabecular thickness and trabecular number, whereas the bone loss inob/obmice was due to decreased trabecular thickness only. Therefore, minor genotype specific changes in bone microarchitecture accompanied changes in bone volume fraction in lumbar vertebrae following HU.\n\nSpaceflight studies in rodents report lower circulating testosterone levels following spaceflight and ground based HU studies in rodents report lower seminal vesicle weight37 42. In the present study, HU reduced seminal vesicle weight in both genotypes, indicating lower testosterone levels. Lower testosterone levels potentially contribute to elevated bone resorption and cancellous bone loss43. However, in spite of gonadal insufficiency, leptin deficiency typically results in a low turnover skeletal phenotype inob/obmice of both sexes44. The precise role of androgens in mediating the action of leptin on bone is unknown but antagonism of estrogen receptor signaling was largely dispensable for leptin's actions in femaleob/obmice44. The present results, identifying similar bone loss in HU WT and HUob/obmice, suggest that preexisting hypogonadism in maleob/obmice did not have a major influence on the magnitude of bone loss following HU.\n\nCompared to WT mice, MAT levels were approximately 10x greater inob/obmice. In concordance with prior work15,16,45, the increase was due to a combination of more numerous and larger adipocytes. HU did not alter adipocyte number or size, findings that contrast with an increase in MAT reported in rats following either spaceflight46or HU47and a previous HU study by Hinoet al. in male B6 mice48. However, the present findings are concordant with a HU study performed in male WBB6F1/J mice housed at thermoneutral24. Hinoet al.48performed their study in 10 week old mice housed at 24 degreesC, which is well below thermoneutral. This may be important because sub thermoneutral housing reduces bone marrow adiposity in B6 mice49and there is accumulating evidence that mild cold stress induced by room temperature housing impacts experimental results50.\n\nMAT levels are often (but not always) negatively associated with osteoblast number and bone mass and are increased in humans following long duration bed rest and in rodents following spaceflight and in some skeletal disuse models9,24,35,51 55. Osteoblasts and adipocytes differentiate from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and some researchers have concluded that adipocyte differentiation impairs osteoblast differentiation35. Furthermore, adipokines produced by MAT have the potential to increase bone resorption56 58. Thus, high levels of MAT in mice could theoretically diminish the skeletal response to mechanical loading by at least two non mutually exclusive mechanisms, impairment of osteoblast differentiation and stimulation of osteoclast activity.\n\nDespite greatly increased levels of MAT in distal femur metaphysis ofob/obmice, the mice did not differ in cancellous bone volume fraction from WT mice. There were also negligible differences between the two genotypes in cortical or cancellous bone responses to HU. Taken together, these findings add to a growing list of studies that contradict a deterministic model where increased MAT levels invariably negatively affect bone metabolism59. These findings also fail to support a model where adipokines produced by MAT contribute to HU induced bone loss.\n\nCancellous bone volume fraction in femur inob/obmice has been variably reported to be lower14, equivalent (present study), or higher17than in age matched WT mice. In our experience, cancellous bone volume fraction in the distal femur metaphysis in conventionally housed (room temperature) mice declines with age in both WT andob/obmice, but the rate of decline is greater in WT mice. Impaired osteoclast activity inob/obmice provides a plausible explanation for slower age related bone loss as well as reported differences in their skeletal phenotype.\n\nLeptin deficiency results in a variety of physical and metabolic changes that could influence osteoclast activity. Metabolically,ob/obmice have impaired thermoregulation, are hypogonadal and hyperphagic, and often have elevated glucose, insulin, and glucocorticoid levels16. In the present study, we limited but did not fully eliminate the contribution of metabolic differences by housingob/obmice at thermoneutral and decreasing their food intake to that of WT mice.ob/obmice preferentially gain fat mass and there is evidence that lean mass contributes more to the positive effect of weight on the skeleton than fat mass30.ob/obmice are sarcopenic, and Hamrick and colleagues have reported a strong linear association between bone mineral content and quadriceps mass inob/oband WT mice14. Additional studies are required to evaluate the comparative effect of muscle atrophy on the skeleton of WT andob/obmice in response to HU.\n\nAs expected, leptin deficiency and HU each resulted in higher corticosterone levels. Although glucocorticoids influence bone metabolism, Zerathet al.60reported that microgravity induced cancellous osteopenia occurred independent of endogenous corticosterone secretion. Furthermore, elevation of endogenous corticosterone levels did not replicate the skeletal changes observed in HU rodents61. While these two studies do not rule out a role for adrenal hormones, it is important to note that parallel increases in corticosterone with HU were detected in WT andob/obmice. This is consistent with the similar magnitude of bone loss following HU in the two genotypes.\n\nSkeletal unweighting, whether due to microgravity, bedrest, limb casting, or spinal cord injury results in bone loss62,63. Impact loading imparted by ground reaction forces, sensory and sympathetic signaling, surgery, and muscle loading each influence bone metabolism64 67. Commonly used models for unweighting the skeleton include HU, unilateral sciatic neurotomy, and limb casting. HU was originally designed as an earth based model for microgravity68and chosen for the current study because (1) it is minimally invasive (i.e., does not require surgery), (2) prevents weight bearing, but unlike limb casting does not prohibit voluntary muscle loading, and (3) in contrast to unilateral sciatic neurotomy, does not directly influence neuronal regulation of bone metabolism.\n\nLeptin is a potent stimulator of bone accrual, but the positive effects of leptin on bone formation in mice occur at low circulating levels of the hormone69. Similar to mice, weight gain in humans is generally associated with increases in BMD30. However, obesity results in hyperleptinemia and the positive association between increased body weight and increased BMD is attenuated in obese subjects70. Prolonged bed rest, a model for skeletal unloading in humans, results in rapid bone loss71. Bedrest studies are typically performed in healthy individuals but bedrest is sometimes used in management of hospitalized patients diagnosed with anorexia nervosa. These individuals, who have very low leptin levels, appear to also exhibit unbalanced bone turnover leading to bone loss72,73.\n\nThere are limitations to the present study. The study focused on the role of leptin in skeletal response to changes in weight. While impact loading on the hindlimbs caused by weight is important to skeletal health, we cannot rule out that leptin plays a role in other forms of skeletal loading, such as loading mediated through muscle contraction. Furthermore, we performed the present study in male mice. Since estrogen is important in regulation of appetite, energy expenditure and metabolism, future studies comparing the skeletal response of femaleob/oband WT HU mice are warranted.\n\nIn summary, chronic leptin deficiency in maleob/obmice resulted in shorter femora, lower femoral bone mass and density, alterations in cortical bone microarchitecture, site  and bone specific alterations in cancellous bone architecture, and greatly increased MAT levels. These results indicate that leptin plays a critical role in normal bone growth, maturation, and turnover. Contrary to expectation, leptin deficiency did not alter the magnitude of HU induced osteopenia in the mouse femur. These findings suggest that leptin is not essential for the skeletal response to unweighting.",
