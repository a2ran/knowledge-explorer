    "abstract": "To determine the short term effects of simulated microgravity on mesenchymal stem cell behaviors as a function of clinorotation speed using time lapse microscopy.\n\nGround based microgravity simulation can reproduce the apparent effects of weightlessness in spaceflight using clinostats that continuously reorient the gravity vector on a specimen, creating a time averaged nullification of gravity. In this work, we investigated the effects of clinorotation speed on the morphology, cytoarchitecture, and migration behavior of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs).\n\nWe compared cell responses at clinorotation speeds of 0, 30, 60, and 75rpm over 8h in a recently developed lab on chip based clinostat system. Time lapse light microscopy was used to visualize changes in cell morphology during and after cessation of clinorotation. Cytoarchitecture was assessed by actin and vinculin staining, and chemotaxis was examined using time lapse light microscopy of cells in NGF (100ng/ml) gradients.\n\nAmong clinorotated groups, cell area distributions indicated a greater inhibition of cell spreading with higher angular frequency (P<0.005), though average cell area at 30rpm after 8h became statistically similar to control (P=0.794). Cells at 75rpm clinorotation remained viable and were able to re spread after clinorotation. In chemotaxis chambers, clinorotation did not alter migration patterns in elongated cells, but most clinorotated cells exhibited cell retraction, which strongly compromised motility.\n\nThese results indicate that hMSCs respond to clinorotation by adopting more rounded, less spread morphologies. The angular frequency dependence suggests that a cell's ability to sense the changing gravity vector is governed by the rate of perturbation. For migration studies, cells cultured in clinorotated chemotaxis chambers were generally less motile and exhibited retraction instead of migration.",
    "methods": "hMSCs were obtained from a commercial source (PT 2501, Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA), and confirmed to be mycoplasma free. Clinochip fabrication required microscope slides (12 544 1, Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and 0.25 mm thick polydimethylsiloxane sheets (HT 6240, Rogers Corporation, Rogers, CT, USA). Fluorescence visualization was performed for actin using 5% (w/v) Texas red phalloidin (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) and for focal adhesions using 1ug/ml fluorescein conjugated anti vinculin (MA1 34629, Life Technologies). Fibronectin (354008, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) was used to enable cell adhesion, and nerve growth factor (NGF; 7S NGF, Life Technologies) was used for migration experiments. Calcein AM and ethidium homodimer 1 (L 3224, Life Technologies) were used to perform cell viability assays.\n\nIn general, we used a single experimental system for all of our experiments, as detailed previously.25In brief, the system consists of a custom microscope mounted gear system, driven by a computer controlled stepper motor that rotates a small slide holder.25This slide holder can accommodate various custom and commercially available lab on chip devices. A non rotating slide holder enables having a static (standard gravity) control condition performed concurrently. The entire system is enclosed in an environmental chamber (Precision Plastics, Beltsville, MD, USA) and installed on an Olympus IX 81 epi fluorescence microscope (Center Valley, PA, USA).\n\nA custom 'clinochip' device was used for visualizing cell spreading (that is, changes in cell morphology over time), and fabricated according to our previously described protocol.25This clinochip consists of three layers comprising polydimethylsiloxane sandwiched between two layers of glass. In brief, we used a high resolution razor cutter (FC8000, Graphtec, Irvine, CA, USA) to trim stock polydimethylsiloxane sheets. The sheet was cut to length and width dimensions of microscope slides and with a single 1 mm wide, 30 mm long channel at the center. A second microscope slide was used as the third layer. Prior to assembly, two 1 mm diameter holes had been made in the top slide using a sandblaster (6500, Airbrasive, Piscataway, NJ, USA) to provide access to the channels. The three layers were energetically bonded using a high frequency corona treater (BD 20AC, Electrotechnic Products, Chicago, IL, USA).\n\nThe clinochip was first sterilized for 20min in a UV chamber. To promote cell attachment, the channel was then treated with 100ug/ml fibronectin for 1h and washed with phosphate buffered saline before use. Passage 3 (P3) and P4 hMSCs were seeded into clinochip channels and incubated at 37 degreesC for 10min to allow for cell attachment, followed by commencement of clinorotation.\n\nCell migration was analyzed using commercially available Ibidi Chemotaxis slides (u Slide Chemotaxis 2D, Ibidi, Munich, Germany). The slides fit perfectly in our clinorotation device and the 2x1mm dimensions of the chamber are suitable for simulated microgravity, as they constrain cells to a narrow region about the axis of rotation to minimize centrifugal effects. First, a 100ug/ml fibronectin solution was injected into the viewing chamber and incubated for 1h, followed by three phosphate buffered saline washes. Then, P3 and P4 hMSCs were plated and incubated at 37 degreesC for 12h of initial seeding time. Our pilot experiments showed that after 12h the spreading areas of hMSCs reach a plateau so that cell spreading would not confound the cell migration data. As a first step, we chose to study hMSC chemotaxis mediated by NGF, one of several growth factors identified in this active field of research.26Mesenchymal stem cells have been shown to express receptors to neurotrophic factors including NGF,27and also secrete NGF during tissue repair.28In these migration experiments, NGF was prepared as a 100ng/ml solution and injected into the top ports of the chamber. Following manufacturer's instructions, the same volume was aspirated from the opposite port to create a chemical gradient.\n\nBoth morphology and chemotaxis platforms were rotated along the axis of the channels in which cells were cultured. Residual accelerations are one to two orders of magnitude smaller than conventional clinostats, even at 75rpm.25Before the experiment, we made sure that the channels did not contain any bubbles, to minimize any other external effects such as shear stress and dehydration. During imaging, we constrained our analyses to cells near the axis of rotation, away from the sides of the channel, to avoid potential edge effects.\n\nAt the appropriate times (10min after seeding for morphology assays; 12h after seeding for chemotaxis and migration assays to allow the cells to become fully spread), clinorotation was initiated at 30, 60, or 75rpm and maintained over the course of 8h. Clinochips at 0rpm (non rotated) were used as a control (standard gravity). During each hour, rotation was paused for a total of 60s, and a set of bright field images of the clinochip were acquired at x200 magnification. At the end of the 8h period, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and fluorescently stained for actin and vinculin. Captured images were analyzed using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health).\n\nCell viability was determined using calcein AM (green) to indicate intracellular esterase activity for live cells and ethidium homodimer 1 (red) to indicate loss of plasma membrane integrity for dead cells. Calcein (final concentration 4uM) and ethidium homodimer (final concentration 2uM) were added to cell culture media that was used to plate hMSCs in fibronectin treated clinochips. After 10min of attachment, clinochips were either rotated at 75rpm or maintained at standard gravity conditions (non rotated control) and fluorescence micrographs were taken at 1, 4, and 8h during clinorotation.\n\nIn addition to the live/dead assays, we acquired light micrographs of cell morphology in standard gravity following exposure to (a) 1 or 4h of 30rpm clinorotation, (b) 1 or 4h of 60rpm clinorotation, or (c) 1, 4, or 8h of 75rpm clinorotation. After termination of the clinorotation treatment, images were acquired in standard gravity every 30min for 4h, and then analyzed for cell area and shape factor using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health).\n\nBecause no prior publications have quantified cell areas during clinorotation, we relied on pilot data for descriptive statistics to make sample size calculations. Assuming a critical significance level ofalpha=0.05, statistical power of 0.9 (beta=0.1), and a detectable difference equal to the population s.d., we performed a power analysis to calculate an estimated sample size ofn=23, using the method of Sokal and Rohlf.29To ensure adequate statistical power for cell area measurements, we chose to include at leastn=30 for each sample group (Table 2), acquired over several experimental replicates. All data are expressed as mean+/ s.e.m. Variance did not markedly differ between groups (less than fourfold). Average cell areas among different clinorotation speeds were first log transformed to improve normality. Differences between clinorotation groups were then statistically analyzed using the Welch'st test for samples with unequal variance and unequal sample size, with Tukeypost hoctests for multiple pairwise comparisons.\n\nNE indicates the number of independent experimental replicates and dnp indicates did not perform.\n\nUsing Welch'st test for samples with unequal variance and sample size, we analyzed differences in cell velocity and directionality between 0 (n=15) and 75rpm (n=6) only for cells that were actively migrating. Similarly, we used Welch'st test with Tukey post hoc test for multiple pairwise comparisons to analyze differences in cell area between 30 and 75rpm (at 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4h) only for cells that were actively retracting (n=28).",
    "results": "Simulated microgravity had a profound effect on both the extent and kinetics of cell spreading (Figure 2). After the initial 10 min cell attachment and before rotation commenced, all of the groups possessed similar cell areas of ~500um2. We found that hMSCs in the non rotated 0rpm condition (i.e., standard gravity) markedly increased spreading areas within 1h after plating, reaching an average of 2000um2. Their spreading area increased gradually with time, until they reached an average of 3000um2by 8h. For clinorotated groups, cell spreading was impeded almost immediately. At 1h, cells in the 30rpm group were significantly smaller than control with an average cell area slightly above 1000um2; cells at 60 and 75rpm were both significantly different from 0 and 30rpm, remaining rounded and small. The effects of clinorotation continued to affect cell spreading over the course of the entire 8h experiment in a rotation speed dependent manner. By 8h, we measured a statistically similar but smaller average area of 2750um2for cells at 30rpm. In contrast, the 60rpm group had an average area of 2192um2, and the 75rpm group had the lowest cell area of 1500um2, both statistically smaller than 0 and 30rpm.\n\nHuman mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) spreading areas in simulated microgravity. (a) Time analysis of cell spreading of hMSCs in simulated microgravity at different rotation speeds (0, 30, 60, and 75rpm). Note that increasing the rotation speed resulted in less spreading area over time. NS Indicates statistically similar average areas (P>0.05). (b) Representative micrographs of hMSCs spreading in a glass substrate coated with FN at different rotation speeds for 8h (0, 30, 60, and 75rpm). Note that cells at a speed of 30rpm were more similar to control, whereas cells at 60 and 75rpm have adopted a more rounded morphology.\n\nFrom a kinetics perspective, the time required for cell spreading areas to reach 2000um2was within 1h for non rotating controls, within 4h for 30rpm, and within 8h for 60rpm. Our experiments did not run long enough to determine whether or not cells would reach this mark for the 75rpm condition, but based on the observed trends, it appears that cell spreading no longer increases after 7h. These results indicate that cell spreading is markedly affected by angular frequency and that these effects can be observed as soon as 1h after clinorotation starts. Finer temporal resolutions and longer durations in future experiments may provide more detailed insight on the time constant of important cellular processes associated with cellular gravisensing.\n\nOne notable observation we made was that cells within each clinorotation speed were not uniformly spread. As individual cells did not accurately represent the population characteristics, we plotted the group wise distributions of cell morphologies at various time points (Supplementary Figure 1). The 0rpm control group adopts a broad distribution of cell areas within the first hour, followed by the 30 and 60rpm groups. By 8h, it is clear that the 0, 30, and 60rpm cell populations encompassed comparable ranges of cell areas. The 75rpm group, however, exhibited a much more narrow distribution. Likewise, when staining for filamentous actin we found that cells also spanned a range of cell shapes within each group (Supplementary Figure 2). There were no discernable differences in actin organization between cells of similar morphology (elongated or rounded), even when comparing across different clinorotation conditions. This suggests that the observed population differences with angular frequency is caused by disparate effects on individual cells, perhaps by triggering/overcoming some intrinsic signal within cells to reduce cell adhesion, suppress actin stress fiber formation, and consequently induce cell rounding. It is unclear whether simulated microgravity directly affects actin stress fiber assembly to result in cell rounding, or whether cell rounding induced by simulated microgravity is what inhibits stress fiber formation.\n\nTo quantify these differences in cell shape as a function of clinorotation speed, we computed circularity (circularity=4*area/perimeter2), as it accommodates more abstract shapes than an aspect ratio calculation. We assigned circularity values above 0.6 to cells that were considered rounded (Figure 3, black), values between 0.3 and 0.6 to semi elongated cells (Figure 3, hatch) and values below 0.3 to elongated cells (Figure 3, gray). As expected from the previous area measurements,Figure 3clearly shows that increasing clinorotation speed results in a larger percentage of rounded cells in its population. The number of elongated cells was significantly reduced with increasing clinorotation speed, and no elongated cells were found at 75rpm.\n\nHuman mesenchymal stem cell shape as function of time at different rotation speeds. We analyzed the shapes of hMSCs at different rotation speeds as a function of time for 1, 4, and 8h; black=rounded cells, line pattern=semi elongated cells, gray=elongated. Cells were stained with phalloidin (actin, red) and representative micrographs were selected for each morphological configuration. At 0rpm, cells were rounded at the first hour and were mostly elongated at the end of our time lapse. At 30rpm, the number of elongated cells was reduced but still present at 4 and 8h. At 60rpm, there were no elongated cells at 4h and there were mostly semi elongated cells at 8h. At 75rpm, the number of rounded cells increases at every time point.\n\nPlotting cell circularity against cell area for each clinorotation speed at different time points, we clearly see a temporal increase in area associated with cell elongation in 0rpm control cells (Supplementary Figure 3). This trend becomes disrupted with exposure to 30 and 60rpm clinorotation, as cells tended to exhibit a broad range of circularity and area. However, only at 75rpm the does cell population maintain high circularity and smaller areas across time points (1, 4, and 8h). Overall, our morphology analysis demonstrates that the cell population at 75rpm possesses a more consistent morphology (average area, cell distribution, circularity versus area over time) over time.\n\nTo determine whether there was any loss of viability or if rounded cells were undergoing apoptosis, we exposed cells to 75rpm and used a live/dead assay after 1, 4, and 8h of clinorotation (Figure 4b). We found no difference in cell viability or changes in cell number when compared with control; in fact, the majority of cells were alive (>90%). Under light microscopy, we observed no evidence of apoptosis (i.e., membrane blebbing) for the cells that were not viable. This also indicates that our clinochip system can be used effectively without loss of cells due to lifting or cell death for at least 8h.\n\nCell viability and recovery after clinorotation. (a) Cell spreading dynamics were measured for cells after 1, 4, and 8h of clinorotation at 75rpm. Four hours after clinorotation was terminated, cell areas were observed to increase by a factor of 1.4 1.8 times. (b) A live/dead stain was used to analyze both cells in the control and cells exposed to clinorotation, and revealed that cell viability was preserved over time. (c) A fluorescence micrograph for live cells (green) and dead cells (red) is provided to demonstrate the data we analyzed, dotted line indicates the axis of rotation. (d) Time lapse micrographs illustrate a round cell adopting a more elongated morphology during recovery in standard microgravity.\n\nWe investigated whether clinorotation effects on cell morphology are reversible by performing time lapse microscopy after exposure to 1, 4, and 8h of 75rpm clinorotation. Following cessation of clinorotation, all cells increased their areas and round cells became more elongated, similar to most of the cells in standard gravity controls (Figure 4a). Similar experiments were also repeated for 30 and 60rpm after 1 and 4h of clinorotation (Supplementary Figure 4).\n\nFor cell migration experiments, cells were seeded in Ibidi chemotaxis chips with a chemical gradient of 100ng/ml NGF to promote cell migration. Under clinorotation, only a few cells migrated, whereas most cells did not (seeTable 2for cell numbers). Cells that were actively migrating at 75rpm had a similar velocity (P=0.391) and directionality (P=0.822) when compared with control cells (Figure 5). Cells that were not migrating under simulated microgravity exhibited morphological retraction (Figure 5). In other words, cell areas changed from fully spread morphologies to more rounded ones. This phenomenon is in agreement with our observations in cell spreading experiments, even when the initial conditions were different (10min for spreading assays versus 12h for chemotaxis and migration assays). We found that during clinorotation cells retracted their area, but did so independently of rotation speed ('0h'P=0.539, '1h'P=0.288, '2h'P=0.963, '3h'P=0.848, '4h'P=0.689, between 30 and 75rpm). After 4h of clinorotation during chemotaxis, cells at 30 and 75rpm reached an average area of 2500um2, which is a value similar to the spreading experiments for 30rpm at 8h (P=0.962 between 30rpm,P=0.975 between 75rpm). However, we did not conduct experiments long enough to determine steady state retracted cell areas.\n\nAnalysis of chemotactic migration of human mesenchymal stem cells in simulated microgravity. Cells stimulated by a chemotactic signal (NGF) in microgravity exhibited one of two behaviors: migration or retraction. Under simulated microgravity, most cells retracted (N=17) and only some cells (N=6) actively migrated. Cells that were actively migrating (left), had a similar velocity (P=0.391) and directionality (P=0.822) in simulated microgravity to those in non rotated conditions. Cells that did not migrate retracted their area as a function of time. This behavior was similar at different clinorotation speeds (P=0.698 at 4h between 30 and 75rpm). Results indicate that the morphological response to microgravity is stronger than the response to the NGF chemotactic signal. NGF, nerve growth factor.\n\nOur results indicate that the cellular response to simulated microgravity is more dominant than chemotactic signals, suggesting the role of migration of hMSCs to tissue repair sites might be suppressed in microgravity. We base this conclusion on our observations of response to NGF at a concentration of 100ng/ml. However, these results were obtained with only one concentration of NGF and it is possible that different concentrations or other chemotactic molecules can elicit a stronger chemotactic response. For example stromal derived factor 1, which is known to be a strong homing signal for hMSCs.30Nevertheless, because the response of adhered cells to clinorotation is retraction of cellular processes, we believe that the behavior will be similar, unless the chemotactic agent can also enhance cell adhesion.",
    "discussion": "Understanding how angular frequency, or rotation speed, of clinorotation affects cell behavior is a critical aspect of microgravity simulation experiments, so that the role of the changing gravity vector in cellular regulation can be appropriately considered. In this work we show that hMSCs can behave differently depending on clinorotation speed. In particular, although average cell area increased more slowly at 30rpm compared with non rotated controls, it continues along an upward trajectory at 8h and seems to be converging with control values. For higher rotational speeds, cell area increases even more slowly, and appears to reach a plateau by 8h at 75rpm. This suggests that changes in cell morphology may approach a limit at an angular frequency that is close to 75rpm, and almost certainly must exceed 30rpm. Although these results are relevant to our clinochip configuration, results may vary for other clinostat devices, particularly for those that support cells in suspension.\n\nOur results are consistent with other research showing that rotation speed affects animal cells, plants, and bacteria (Escherichia coli). For example, a study on osteoblastic ROS 17/2.8 cells reported that rotations at 10 and 40rpm did not exhibit reproducible, detectable changes from stationary control cells.31Only a speed of 50rpm showed reproducible changes in actin cytoskeleton and cell surface integrin beta1 and apoptosis. The same effect has been observed with E. coli,32which exhibited differential response as a function of clinorotation speeds from 10 to 50rpm. Interestingly, the difference between 40 and 50rpm is only 0.1674 of a cycle per second, indicating that cells can be highly sensitive to small changes in angular frequency.\n\nAlthough a precise gravisensing mechanism has yet to be determined, it must be one that can detect subtle alterations to external forces in a short period of time. Our data indicate that it is linked to pathways that are involved in cell spreading and cytoskeletal organization, two phenomena that have been observed for different cell types. Potential candidates could be one or more molecules already known to play important roles in cellular mechanoregulation, such as the Rho family of GTPases,33ion mechanosensitive channels,34intracellular calcium,35nuclear deformations,36focal adhesions, or other cell surface receptors.37Although mechanosensitive pathways seem the most direct apparatus for gravisensing, others have also suggested the importance of external environmental factors including fluid shear, fluid and nutrient exchange, oxygen content, buoyancy, and changes in the extracellular matrix.38Thus, clinostats used to probe candidate gravisensing receptors should minimize external environmental variables that arise from clinostat operation.\n\nIn the context of a proposed framework for cellular gravisensing, the current results are consistent with our working hypothetical model (Figure 1b). Standard gravity would constitute a constant gravitational stimulus and be detectable to all cells. With intermediate timescales of gravitational nullification, the probability for a single cycle of rotational perturbation to evade gravisensing in each cell would assume a broad distribution. As any putative biochemical gravisensing reaction(s) would be stochastic, the probability for gravisensory evasion in each cell would decrease with both lower angular frequency and exposure to longer duration perturbations. We did in fact observe such trends, as a result of the time lapse, single cell measurement capabilities of the clinochip system.\n\nFor our clinochips, we do not expect that centripetal forces have a role with our observed angular frequency dependence, as residual accelerations were calculated to be on the micro scale regime. In addition, because the capillary number (indicative of viscous forces) is orders of magnitude smaller than surface tension, fluid shear forces are deemed negligible. There is also no enhanced nutrient transport that accompanies clinorotation in our system. Without these confounding factors, it seems reasonable to conclude that the cell morphology differences we observed were predominantly due to changes in the angular frequency of clinorotation.\n\nWe believe the rounding and retracted cell area of hMSCs in simulated microgravity inhibit migration in the presence of a chemical gradient. Interestingly, the kinetics of cell area changes during retraction were different from those during spreading, and were also angular frequency independent, suggesting that distinct gravisensing mechanisms may regulate different processes. Similarly, other cell processes, and even cell fate, could be affected.39In the same way that microgravity may produce these cellular alterations, other mechanical stimuli and substrate characteristics can also modulate cell function.40\n\nStem cell morphology has a strong correlation with cellular phenotype and differentiation potential.41,42It has been demonstrated in prior work that spread cells have a higher tendency to undergo osteogenesis and that cells with rounded morphologies are more susceptible to adipogenesis.42Because of the short term nature of this current study, it is not possible to establish whether hMSCs in our system would behave according to these trends. However, our data would suggest that cells at 30rpm clinorotation would be more amenable to osteogenic differentiation, whereas cells at 75rpm would tend toward adipogenic or chondrogenic lineages. This may help explain the conflicting reports on mesenchymal stem cells differentiation during clinorotation that we and others23have observed. Future longer term studies with the clinochip are required to explore hMSC differentiation potential. Specifically, as we have shown that the population distribution of cell morphologies can be controlled by the angular frequency of rotation, we may be able to derive cellular phenotypes desirable for stem cell renewal, repair, and tissue engineering.",
