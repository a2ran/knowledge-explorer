    "abstract": "Extra intestinal pathogenicE. coli(ExPEC), including avian pathogenicE. coli(APEC), pose a considerable threat to both human and animal health, with illness causing substantial economic loss. APEC strain 7122 (O78K80H9), containing three large plasmids [pChi7122 1 (IncFIB/FIIA FIC), pChi7122 2 (IncFII), and pChi7122 3 (IncI2)]; and a small plasmid pChi7122 4 (ColE2 like), has been used for many years as a model strain to study the molecular mechanisms of ExPEC pathogenicity and zoonotic potential. We previously sequenced and characterized the plasmid pChi7122 1 and determined its importance in systemic APEC infection; however the roles of the other pChi7122 plasmids were still ambiguous. Herein we present the sequence of the remaining pChi7122 plasmids, confirming that pChi7122 2 and pChi7122 3 encode an ABC iron transport system (eitABCD) and a putative type IV fimbriae respectively, whereas pChi7122 4 is a cryptic plasmid. New features were also identified, including a gene cluster on pChi7122 2 that is not present in otherE. colistrains but is found inSalmonellaserovars and is predicted to encode the sugars catabolic pathways. In vitro evaluation of the APEC 7122 derivative strains with the three large plasmids, either individually or in combinations, provided new insights into the role of plasmids in biofilm formation, bile and acid tolerance, and the interaction ofE. colistrains with 3 D cultures of intestinal epithelial cells. In this study, we show that the nature and combinations of plasmids, as well as the background of the host strains, have an effect on these phenomena. Our data reveal new insights into the role of extra chromosomal sequences in fitness and diversity of ExPEC in their phenotypes.",
    "methods": "Most of the bacterial strains used in this study, listed inTable 1, are derived from the highly virulent APEC strain 7122 (O78K80H9)[79]and were fully described in our previous studies[10],[12],[80].\n\nTo evaluate the effect of the host strain background on plasmid associated phenotypes, we used three derivatives of 7122 with different LPS profiles containing the three plasmids pChi7122 1, pChi7122 2, and pChi7122 3; a rough mutant strain (O78 ) of APEC 7122, 7145; and two derivatives of 7145, 7167 and 7193, which respectively express O111 and O1 antigens rather than the native O78 antigen. We also used strains derived from anE. coliK 12, 6092, containing either pChi7122 1, 7346; pChi7122 2, 7347; or pChi7122 3, 7348 (Table 1,[10],[12],[80]).\n\nAntibiotic susceptibility testing of strains was performed and interpreted via disk diffusion method, as recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)[81],[82].\n\nA collection of one hundred human strains isolated from the main clinical extra intestinal sources (50 UTI and 50 non UTI)[19], eighty APEC strains, and forty five entericE. colistrains (from our collection) were used to study the distribution of pChi7122 2 and pChi7122 3 associated genes among different groups of pathogenicE. coliby PCR.\n\nUnless otherwise stated, bacteria were routinely grown in Luria Bertani (LB) broth or on MacConkey agar supplemented with 1% lactose at 37 degreesC. Strains were stored as stock cultures at  80 degreesC in peptone glycerol medium. All wild type derivative strains grew similarly in LB and reached the OD6001.0 when incubated overnight (O/N) at 37 degreesC standing, except the strain 7561 (pChi7122 1, pChi7122 2) which had a slightly lower growth and its OD600was around 0.8 when grown in the same conditions.\n\nThe DNA sequences of pChi7122 2, pChi7122 3 and pChi7122 4 plasmids were derived from contig sequences of the whole genomic DNA of APEC 7122. The sequences were manipulated to the standard of an 'Improved High Quality Draft'[83]. The program Artemis[84]was used to identify the plasmids and collate data. For each of the three plasmids all the sequence gaps were closed by directed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the products sequenced with big dye terminator chemistry on ABI3730 capillary sequencers. All the plasmids were circularized and contiguated using this method.\n\nThe DNA sequences were annotated to identify coding sequences and repeat sequences in Artemis and the vector NTI suite of programs was used to confirm the previous analysis. To identify plasmids with similar sequences, pChi7122 2 (FR851303) and pChi7122 3 (FR851304) were compared by BLASTn at NCBI. Plasmid sequences of pEG356 (FN594520.1) fromShigella sonnei, pHK01 (HM355591.1) from a urinaryE. coliisolate, pAA (FN554767.1) from EAEC, and pKF3 70 (FJ494913.1) fromK. pneumoniae, and R721 (AP002527.1) a trimethoprim and streptomycin resistant plasmid from anE. coliwere downloaded. Plasmid sequences were aligned and then visualized using ACT and Mauve v2.3.1[85]. Schematic plasmid drawings were constructed using DNAplotter[86].\n\nAmino acid sequence and protein structural based alignments were performed using the CLC Free Workbench software tool (v. 6.1 CLC bio A/S, Aarhus, Denmark) and the web based interface for ESPript v.2.2 (http://espript.ibcp.fr/ESPript/cgi bin/ESPript.cgi)[87], respectively. The 3 D structure of the proteins pChiA, pChiT, pChiO, pChiD, and pChiR were predicted using position specific iterative (PSI)  BLAST alignment and HHpred[38].\n\nOne hundred humanE. colistrains isolated from the main clinical extra intestinal sources (50 UTI and 50 non UTI)[19], eighty APEC strains, and forty five entericE. colistrains (from our collection) were screened by PCR[19]for the presence of theeitA,pilS, andpilVgenes using the primerseitAF:5 AACTGCGGCTATCAGGAGAC 3andeitAR :5 CAGGTCATATCCCACAGCTT 3;pilSF:5 CTTCTCTTTCTGCACACCGT 3andpilSR:5 TGTGATTGTAACGGAGCC 3;pilVF:5 TCTATACAGGCGAGTATTTA 3andpilVR:5 AATTCATACCAGAATACTCA 3. The primers were designed from the sequence of pChi7122 2 (eitA) and pChi7122 3 (pilSandpilV).\n\nThe growth rates of strains were compared in iron sequestered medium using LB containing 100 uM of alpha,alpha dipyridyl alone or supplemented with either Heme (Sigma, 600 ug ml 1), hemoglobin (Sigma, 60 ug ml 1), or FeSO4(Sigma, 20 mM: control). The growth rates were also tested in minimal medium MM9[12], MM9 with thiamin (1 ug ml 1) and 0.1% casamino acid, and supplemented with glucose, lactose, arabinose, mannose, galactose, glucuronic acid, or glucoronic acid (0.2%) as source of carbon at 37 degreesC shaking (180 rpm). The OD600was recorded every hour over 24 hour period.\n\n3 D cultures of human INT 407 cells (ATCC CCL6) were used as model intestinal epithelium and were prepared as previously described[54]. Approximately 106CFU of PBS washed bacteria, grown rotating to an OD6001.0 in LB, were added to each well (multiplicity of infection [MOI], 10). For bacterial association assays, the 24 well plates were incubated at 37 degreesC in 5% CO2for 1 hour, and rinsed three times with PBS. PBS 0.1% (w/v) deoxycholic acid sodium salt was added to each well, and samples were diluted and spread on MacConkey medium plates for enumeration by viable colony counting. For invasion assays, extracellular bacteria were killed following the initial 1 h incubation period by an additional 1 h incubation in medium containing gentamicin (100 ug/ml; Sigma Aldrich). Cells were then washed 3x with PBS and lysed. Bacterial titers in the lysates were determined by serial dilutions and plating on MacConkey agar. The results were expressed as the Log10CFU/ml.\n\nAntibodies specific for O78 LPS (Denken Seiken) and the human tight junction protein ZO 1 (Invitrogen) were used for confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) imaging. Antibodies were of porcine and mouse origins, respectively, and were used at a dilution of 1500 (anti O78 LPS) and 1100 (anti ZO 1). Goat anti porcine and anti mouse secondary antibodies labeled with Alexa Fluor 555 (Invitrogen) were used to detect the bound primary antibodies anti O78 LPS and anti ZO 1 respectively and were diluted 1500 in blocking solution (8% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Triton X100 in DPBS). Cell nuclei and the F actin cytoskeleton were visualized with 4, 6 diamidino 2 phenylindole hydrochloride (DAPI) and phalloidin (Invitrogen), respectively. The fixation and staining of 3 D aggregates was performed as described previously[88]. Optical sections of the 3 D aggregates were obtained using a Zeiss LSM 510 Duo laser scanning microscope equipped with detectors and filter sets for monitoring emissions of the selected fluorophores. Images were acquired using a Plan Neofluar 40x/1.3 oil DIC objective and were analyzed with the Zeiss LSM software package. Axiovision 4.8 software from Carl Zeiss was used to further process collected images.\n\nTo determine the ability of bacteria to survive at sub lethal bile concentration, different strains were grown rotating to an OD6001.0 in LB medium. Five microliters of serial ten fold dilutions of each strain were spotted on both LB agar and LB agar containing 1% (w/v) DOC plates and incubated overnight at 37 degreesC.\n\nFor acid shock assays, bacterial cells were grown at 37 degreesC in LB broth, pH 7, O/N standing. Cultures adjusted to the same OD600of 1.0 were diluted 11,000 in LB, pH 2.5, and incubated at 37 degreesC with gentle shaking (50 rpm). Samples were cultured by direct plating on LB agar after 8 h and 18 h to determine the percent survival following acid stress. As controls, bacteria were also grown in LB, pH 7 in the same conditions to determine if the growth of bacteria was affected.\n\nBiofilm formation assays were performed in 96 well polystyrene microtiter plates (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ)[89]. In brief, strains were grown to stationary phase in LB at 37 degreesC and then diluted 1100 in LB supplemented with 0.1% (w/v) L glucose. Aliquots of 200 uL for each dilution were dispensed per well into a microtiter plate (four wells/strain). Each strain was tested in quadruplicate, wells containing sterile medium were used as negative controls. Plates were sealed with parafilm and cultured standing either at 30 degreesC, 37 degreesC or 42 degreesC for 5 days to mimic the environmental and body temperature of humans and chickens, respectively. The media of the plates were then decanted, and the plates were washed twice with sterile PBS. Microplates were then stained with 200 uL of 1% (w/v) Crystal Violet for 30 min, followed by washing twice with PBS to remove unbound dye. After drying, dye containing adherent cells were resolubilized with 200 uL of 30% (v/v) acetic acid solution. The absorbance was measured at 570 nm in an ELISA reader (SpectraMax M2, Molecular Devices). All tests were carried out at least three times, and the results were averaged.\n\nData were analyzed by one way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Bonferroni's multiple comparison test (GraphPad Prism software, version 5.07). Differences between average values were also tested for significance by performing an unpaired, two sided Studentttest. The levels of significance (Pvalues) are reported and values <=0.05 were taken to be significant.",
    "results": "Genome sequencing has made major contributions to our knowledge of virulence and the evolution of pathogenic bacteria. So far, virulence plasmids associated with ExPEC are ColV, ColBM and Vir plasmids[20]; many of which are already fully sequenced and have been determined as belonging mainly to the IncFIB/FIIA backbone. Although PCR characterization of UPEC and APEC plasmids has revealed the presence of plasmids from other Inc groups[21], studies on their role in ExPEC has been limited. Previously, we examined the role of the three large plasmids of APEC 7122 in pathogenesis in chickens[12]and sequenced the plasmid pChi7122 1[19]. We were able to assign roles for pChi7122 1 in the virulence in systemic infection of bacteria; however the roles of pChi7122 2 and pChi7122 3 in APEC 7122 were equivocal.\n\nIn this study, we present the whole DNA sequences of plasmids pChi7122 2 (FR851303), pChi7122 3 (FR851304) and pChi7122 4 (FR851305). The general sequence features of the three plasmids are listed in theTable 2.\n\nATB, antibiotic; Strr, streptomycin resistant; Sxtr, Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole resistant;  , absent.\n\nPlasmids pChi7122 2, pChi7122 3 and pChi7122 4 consist of 82,676 bp, 56,676 bp and 4,300 bp respectively (Fig. 1,Table 2) and are predicted to encode 115, 86, and 3 coding sequences (CDS) respectively (Table 2,Table S1andS2); these CDSs include the complete sequences for the iron acquisition systemeitABCDon pChi7122 2 and type IV fimbriae on pChi7122 3, which have been previously shown to be present on these plasmids by PCR[12]. Analysis of pChi7122 4 revealed 3 CDSs that were predicted to encode plasmid replication and maintenance functions only (Table 2,Fig. 1); consequently we excluded this plasmid from all further experimental analysis.\n\nThe different rings represent (from outer to inner) CDS which are color coded by functional group (ring 1 and 2), deviation from average G+C content (ring 3), and GC skew [(G C)/(G+C); ring 4]. Colors represent the following: red, virulence associated; green, plasmid transfer; yellow, plasmid replication; grey other functions; brown, hypothetical protein.\n\nWe assessed the presence ofeitAgene of pChi7122 2 and two genes of pChi7122 3 (pilSandpilV) by PCR among 225 pathogenicE. colistrains from different origins, including 100 humanE. colistrains isolated from the main clinical extra intestinal sources (50 UTI and 50 non UTI), 80 APEC, and 45 human enteric pathogenicE. coli. PCR results show thateitAwas present in 10% of non UTI human isolates and 5% of APEC strains, but was absent in other groups. The genespilSandpilVof pChi7122 3 were detected in 8.75% of the APEC group and in 10% of human UTI isolates, respectively. The low prevalence of pChi7122 2 (eitA) and pChi7122 3 (pilSandpilV) genes among other ExPEC of human and avian origin, as determined by PCR, could indicate the recent acquisition of these genes by theseE. colistrains, enabling them to inhabit new niches.\n\nOur past work has determined that plasmids pChi7122 2 and pChi7122 3 are self conjugative[12]. Herein, their sequences analysis has revealed the presence of genes required for their transfer (Fig. 1,Table S1andS2). The transfer region of pChi7122 2 is about 34 kb consisting of 24traand 9trbgenes (Table S1) and is identical to the one of the virulence plasmid pAA (FN554767.1; 99% identity with 92% coverage), whereas thetraregion of pChi7122 3 has the same organization as its equivalent inE. coliconjugative plasmid IncI2 R721 (AP002527.1); it contains 11tra/trbgenes, grouped in two clusters separated by twopilgenes (Fig. 1,Table S2). pChi7122 3 also harbors genesnikB,nikC, andnikAfor relaxome formation involved in plasmid transfer[22],[23](Fig. 1,Table S2).\n\nAmong the three plasmids, only pChi7122 2 carries antibiotic resistance genes (MM2 101, MM2 102 and MM2 103) (Table S1). These genes encode for a dihydropteroate synthase (sul1)[24], a GCN5 related N acetyl transferase[25]and a streptomycin 3 adenylytransferase(SP R) (aadA)[26], respectively. The phenotypic expression of streptomycin and sulfonamide (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) resistance in strains containing pChi7122 2 has been determined by disk diffusion tests. Although streptomycin has only limited current usage in clinical medicine, it remains important for therapy of, and growth promotion in, animals and bacterial disease control in plants[27]. It was suggested that sulphonamide resistance genes can be transferred from commensal bacteria via integrons, transposons or plasmids, into more virulent bacteria in the intestine[28].\n\nComparative analysis of the pChi7122 plasmids with those in the public databases using BLASTn showed that pChi7122 2 shares high homology with plasmids fromShigella sonnei(pEG356), an urinaryE. coliisolate (pHK01), EAEC (pAA), andK. pneumoniae(pKF3 70), respectively (with 100% identity and 70% coverage). The pChi7122 3 genome has shown homology with only one plasmid, theE. coliplasmid R721 (with 99% identity and 90% coverage), which includes the type IV fimbriaepiloperon[29],[30]and shufflon[31],[32]. Mauve alignment of pChi7122 2 and pChi7122 3 with their respective homologous plasmids confirmed these homologies (Fig. S1).\n\nThe plasmid pChi7122 2 and its homologous plasmids have a 4 kb region in common, which encodes for the ABC iron uptake locuseitABCD(Fig. 2A), previously described in two other APEC plasmids, pAPEC O2 ColV[17]and pAPEC O1 ColBM[15]. A DNA comparison of the regions ofeitABCDof the six plasmids has shown that with the exception of pAPEC O2 ColV, this region is located downstream of theparregion of plasmids and is flanked by the transposontnpAgene in pChi7122 2, pHK01, and pEG356 respectively and by an insertion sequenceIS629 in pAPEC O1 ColBM (Fig. 2A) which could explain the dissemination ofeitABCDamong genomes of these bacteria. We were unable to detect the iron uptake phenotype expression ofeitABCDgenes using CAS agar medium[12], even though it was efficient in revealing those of pChi7122 1 and chromosomally encoded systems. Therefore in this study, we extended the analysis by testing the growth of strains, with and without the three plasmids, in iron limited medium alone or supplemented with either FeSO4, heme or hemoglobin. Our results show that only pChi7122 1 increased the growth of strains in iron sequestered environments (Fig. S2). The ability to acquire iron from heme and hemoglobin could be related to the autotransporter Tsh encoded by pChi7122 1[33], which has previously been reported to bind to red blood cells[34]. Future studies are needed to determine conditions of expression ofeitABCD, such as under in vivo conditions.\n\nTheeitABCDregion from pChi7122 2 was compared to its equivalent in pHK01 (HM355591.1), pEG356 (FN594520.1), pAPEC O2 ColV (NC_007675.1), pAA (FN554767.1), and pAPEC O1 ColBM (NC_009837.1) (A); and sugars pathways genome regionpChiA pChiOTDRin pChi7122 2 to its equivalent found in the genomes ofS. Enteritidis (AM933172.1),S. Gallinarum (AM933173.1),S.Weltevreden (FR775220.1) andS. Agona (CP001138.1) respectively (B).\n\nAn important aspect of pathogenesis is the ability of bacteria to adapt their metabolism to the available nutrients by coordinating their metabolism with their life cycle[35]. Recent reports have shown that in the intestine, both commensal and enterohemorrhagicE. coli(EHEC) require multiple carbon metabolic pathways[36],[37].\n\nIn this study, DNA sequence analysis of pChi7122 2 has revealed the presence of two systems of sugar utilization pathways. This system, with two divergent operons, consists of a gene for a starvation sensing protein (pChiA) located in the opposite orientation to four successive genespChiOTDR(Fig. 2B,3). These genes have no significant homology with DNA sequences of otherE. coliavailable on public databases, as determined by MegaBLASTn search analysis, but share 94% homology (with 100% coverage) with the chromosomal DNA sequence of genomes ofSalmonellaEnteritidis (AM933172.1), Gallinarum (AM933173.1), Weltevreden (FR775220.1) and Agona (CP001138.1), respectively (Fig. 2B). The sequence analysis of this region in theseSalmonellaserovars has determined that, with the exception ofS. Agona, in which thepChiA equivalent gene is truncated, the organization of thepChiOTDRhomologous genes in the genome of the four pathogens is the same (Fig. 2B). The identities of the proteins translated by these genes were between 86% 99% (Fig. 2B,Table S3, andFig. S3).\n\nIllustration of the proposed biochemical pathway for putative sugar utilization encoded by the operonpChiOTDR(A), the predicted 3D model and function of each enzyme are presented; and diagrammatic representation of the genetic organization of the putative sugar utilization operonpChiA pChiOTDR(B). The two promoter regions identified are indicated with arrows. Bioinformatic analysis indicated that pChiR may act as a transcriptional regulator ofpChiOTDRgenes. The promoter region contains independent CRP binding boxes indicated in red. The promoter elements forpChiOTDR(Ppchi) located in the positive DNA strand are underlined. The promoter elements forpChiA(PpChiA) in the negative strand are in bold and red without underlining.\n\nThe putative functions and the predicted 3 D structures of thepChiAandpChiOTDRgene products, determined by Blast PSI and HHpred[38], show thatpChiAencodes for a bifunctional dehydratase that utilizes both D mannonate and D altronate as substrates[39]andpChiOTDRencode for a gluconate 5 dehydrogenase, pChiO; an exonate sugar transport, pChiT; an L idonate 5 dehydrogenase, pChiD; and a regulator protein GntR like, pChiR, respectively (Table S3,Fig. 3A). Two promoter regions, PpChiAand PpChi, with independent cAMP receptor protein (CRP) binding boxes[40],[41], were detected in the promoter region ofpChiAandpChiO(Fig. 3B). Bioinformatic analysis indicated that pChiR is a putative transcriptional regulator from GntR family[42]. In the absence of glucose, the preferred carbon source forE. coli, the CRP would activate the pChi7122 2 sugars pathways[40],[41]; whereas pChiR would have an opposite effect. It is known that colonic mucus contains several sugar acids that represent an important source of nutrients and that genes involved in the catabolism of N acetylglucosamine, sialic acid, glucosamine, gluconate, arabinose, and fucose are expressed in both commensalE. coliand EHEC[36]. It has also been reported that UPEC bacteria grown in urine express enzymes for catabolism of sialic acid, gluconate, xylose, and arabinose[43]and genes involved in the transport of gluconate and related hexonates are up regulated inS.Typhimurium in macrophages[44], suggesting that the new pChi7122 2 sugar pathways could also be important either in the pathogenesis of APEC, as well as inSalmonellaserovars Enteritidis, Gallinarum, Weltevreden and Agona or in their persistence in different hosts.\n\nCompared to the chromosomalE. coliK 12 L idonic acid pathway encoded by thegnTIIgenes,idnK idnDOTR[45], the genes of the operonpChiOTDRof pChi7122 2 have no significant homologies at the DNA level and share some sequence identity at the protein level (Table 3); moreover, the position of the gene of L idonate 5 dehydrogenase is different in the two distinct gene clusters. Intriguingly, the gluconate kinase gene,idnK, of GnTII pathway[45]is absent in the pChi7122 2 pathway and is substituted by the gene of the starvation sensing protein,rspA like[46]pChiAwhich is essential for survival of bacteria in limited nutrient conditions. The gene encoding the regulatory protein GntR in the GnTII pathways, exhibits no significant homology at both DNA and protein levels with its counterpart in pChi7122 2 (pChiR) (Table 3). In this study, although we have shown that strains have better growth in media with glucoronic acid than with other sugars tested (Fig. S4), there were no significant differences between strains with and without the plasmid pChi7122 2. The functionality of the sugar utilization pathway genes located on pChi7122 2 would be more apparent ingntII operon deleted strains[45], or by evaluation of their expression under in vivo conditions, such as using the selective capture of transcribed sequences (SCOTS) method[47]. Future studies will be conducted to determine the conditions of their expression and their eventual role in both APEC andSalmonellaserovars.\n\nAA, amino acid;  , absent; NSH, no significant homology.\n\nThe genomic diversity among ExPEC isolates has been described and multiple factors have been linked to their virulence[48],[49]. However, a systematic analysis of ExPEC phenotypic diversity has not been done previously. In this study, the large plasmids associated phenotypes related to fitness of ExPEC bacteria as well the effect of host strain backgrounds were investigated.\n\nIntestines are suspected to be a primary reservoir of ExPEC strains causing diseases in both humans[50]and chickens[5]. To determine if large plasmids would increase the fitness of their carriers in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract environment, we assessed the ability of strains to colonize intestine cells and resist both acid and bile, attributes that allow enteric bacteria to live and persist in the intestine of their host[51].\n\nSome APEC strains are genetically similar to human ExPEC, especially to uropathogenicE. coli(UPEC)[52], and could cause human diseases[53]. Herein, we investigated the ability of APEC derivative strains to associate with, and invade into, human cells of the kind that may be targeted by human ExPEC bacteria during their commensal life cycle in the intestine. The intestine is suspected to be a reservoir of ExPEC that cause infections in humans[50]. Since APEC strains are now considered as potential food borne pathogens that could be transmitted to humans via poultry products[4],[6],[28], we aimed to investigate the interaction of APEC derivative strains with 3 D organotypic models of human intestinal epithelial cells. The 3 D model of intestinal epithelium used in this study has been shown previously to mimic the in vivo parental tissue more closely than monolayer cultures with regard to morphology and function[54]. The highly differentiated character of the 3 D intestinal cells is reflected in the presence of distinct apical and basolateral polarity, increased expression and better organization of tight junctions, extracellular matrix, and brush border proteins, highly localized expression of mucins, and multiple epithelial cell types relevant to those found in vivo[55]. Our data showed that APEC derivative strains were able to associate with, and invade into, human intestinal epithelial cells, and large plasmids did not have significant effect on these characteristics (Fig. 4). Although tight junctions efficiently restrict most microbes from penetrating into deeper tissues and contain the microbiota, some pathogens have developed specific strategies to alter or disrupt these structures as part of their pathogenesis, resulting in either pathogen penetration, or other consequences such as diarrhea. In this study, evaluation of different APEC derivative strains for their interaction with 3 D human intestinal epithelial cells, showed that although these strains attached and invaded into these cells, they did not disturb their tight junctions, based on immunofluorescence evaluation (Fig. 4). These data suggest that invasion of the intestine and dissemination would not occur through intercellular transportation of the bacteria, which could potentially disseminate through transcellular transportation, a mechanism used by meningitis causing bacteria, includingE. coliK1 to invade brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs)[56]. These bacteria could live as commensals in the intestines from where they shed and cause diseases in different hosts or other sites of the same host.\n\nMean of Log CFU/ml and standard deviation of bacteria association and invasion with cells (A) Representative confocal laser scanning micrographs showing association, and invasion of 3 D INT 407 cells with 7122 and derivatives (B). Bacteria are marked in green, while the blue and red colors represent cell nuclei labeled with DAPI and F actin cytoskeleton labeled with phalloidin, respectively; and ZO 1 staining of non infected and infected 3 D INT 407 with plasmid derivative strains (C). Non infected 3 D INT 407 aggregates (a) or 3 D INT 407 aggregates infected for 2 h with wild type (7122) (b), pChi7122 1,2,3 (7368) (c), pChi7122 1 (7394) (d), pChi7122 2 (7392) (e), pChi7122 3 (7367) (f), pChi7122 1,2 (7561) (g), pChi7122 1,3 (7562) (h), and pChi7122 2,3 (7274) (I). The ZO 1 antigen is marked in green, while the blue color represents cell nuclei labeled with DAPI. Images are presented with (indicated as \"2\") and without (indicated as \"1\") DAPI labeling for clarity purposes. Images are based on 400x magnifications. Arrows indicate the bacteria stained in green; Abbreviations used are: pChi7122 1,2,3=pChi7122 1, pChi7122 2, and pChi7122 3; pChi7122 1,2=pChi7122 1 and pChi7122 2; pChi7122 1,3=pChi7122 1 and pChi7122 3; pChi7122 2 3=pChi7122 2 and pChi7122 3.\n\nMechanisms associated with bile resistance in bacteria are LPS synthesis, expression of efflux pump genes and regulatory genes such asmarABandphoPQ[51]. In this study, we have shown that all wild type derived strains tested were resistant to deoxycholate (DOC), one of the most abundant bile salts in humans (data not shown); whereas the group of strains derived fromE. coliK 12 behaved differently (Fig. 5A). Although,E. coliK 12 was sensitive to the bile, its plasmid derivative strains 7346 (pChi7122 1) and 7347 (pChi7122 2) had increased survival in LB agar media with 1% (w/v) DOC as compared to their parent 6092. The strain 7348 (pChi7122 3) was as sensitive to bile as its parent strain 6092 (Fig. 5A). According to our results APEC 7122 strain better tolerates the presence of bile salts in the media thenE. coliK 12 which was sensitive to the detergent (Fig. 5, data of wild type not shown). The mechanism of resistance of APEC could be both LPS and plasmid related. In fact, the detection of plasmid associated resistance inE. coliK 12 background but not in the wild type background strains, could be related to the presence of other factors, including the LPS in these strains that has masked the effect of plasmids on this phenomenon; this statement is supported by the resistance of the rough mutant which is usually hypersensitive to bile[57]. The mechanism of resistance encoded by the plasmid pChi7122 1 could be associated with proteins such as OmpT that was previously associated with bile resistance inVibrio cholerae[58]and ABC transport proteins that are known to play a role in the protection of cells from toxic compounds[59]. Since such factors are not located on pChi7122 2, other factors predicted to be encoded by this plasmid, such as TA modules could be involved in bile tolerance of bacteria; as TA systems are now known to play an important role in bacterial stress physiology[60],[61],[62]. To our knowledge, this is the first time that plasmids have been shown to be associated with the bile resistance ofE. coli.\n\nBile sensitivity assay forE. coliK 12 and derivatives, no plasmids (6092), pChi7122 1 (7346), pChi7122 2 (7347), and pChi7122 3 (7348). Five microliters of serial ten fold dilutions of each strain were spotted on both LB and LB +1% (w/v) DOC agar plates. The approximate numbers of bacteria present in each dilution are indicated on the right side of the plate (A). Percent acid survival of wild type derivative strains in acid shock for 18 hours (B). Abbreviations used are: pChi7122 1,2,3=pChi7122 1, pChi7122 2, and pChi7122 3; pChi7122 1,2=pChi7122 1 and pChi7122 2; pChi7122 1,3=pChi7122 1 and pChi7122 3; pChi7122 2 3=pChi7122 2 and pChi7122 3.\n\nAcid resistance is important for bacterial survival in acidic stomach or in foods with low pH[63]. Our results have shown that plasmids do not have any effect on the growth of the wild type derived strains when grown in acidic medium for a short period (12 hours), as the strains with and without plasmids grew similarly (data not shown). However, at longer incubation times (18 hours), strains behaved differently (Fig. 5B). Similar to the study by Limet al.[64]on the plasmid pO157 inE. coliO157, we have shown that in the absence of its three plasmids, the APEC strain survived better in acidic conditions than in their presence when incubated for 18 h. Moreover, our study showed that although the plasmid pChi7122 1, either alone or in combination with pChi7122 2 or pChi7122 3, decreased the acid tolerance of bacteria, the presence of pChi7122 3 had the opposite effect (Fig. 5B). Since pChi7122 1 and pO157 play a major role in the virulence of APEC[12]andE. coliO157[64]respectively, these findings could indicate that the presence of plasmids exert a cost to bacterial fitness when exposed for a long period (>18 hours) to acidic conditions, whereas bacteria containing other plasmids such as pChi7122 3 in 7122 would have better survivability in these conditions. Elucidation of the mechanism of acid tolerance associated with pChi7122 3 is needed to fully understanding the persistence ofE. coliin acidic conditions.\n\nOur study also confirmed the importance of the full expression of O78 antigen LPS for the acid tolerance ofE. coli[65], and demonstrated that the nature of LPS had a minor effect on this stress response (Fig. 5B).\n\nBacterial biofilm formation is a major concern in both medical and industrial systems. Biofilm formation is associated with many medically important pathogenic bacteria, as an estimated 65 80% of all human infections are thought to be biofilm related[66]. However, elucidating the mechanisms of biofilm formation necessary for establishing strategies for their prevention and treatments is becoming a matter of urgency.\n\nExPEC cells are found in biofilm like communities in both gastrointestinal[67]and urinary tracts[68]indicating the importance of biofilms in the persistence of these bacteria. ExPEC bacteria have to adapt to extreme temperature changes. In this study, our strategy using three large plasmids, either individually or in combination in both an APEC wild type and anE. coliK 12 background, and different O LPS at different temperatures, has revealed new insights into biofilm formation of ExPEC. Altogether, our data distinguished four groups of factor driven biofilms, including plasmidless , plasmid , O LPS , and rough LPS mediated biofilms inE. coliwhich differ in their expression conditions.\n\nIn general, the different strains tested formed more biofilms at 30 degreesC than at 37 degreesC or 42 degreesC (Fig. 6A). Compared to the wild type, the plasmidless strain produced significantly more biofilm at 30 degreesC (P<0.05) (Fig. 6A). In the same conditions, the presence of the three plasmids, either individually or in combinations in the strains, reduced the level of biofilm formation to the level of the wild type strain (Fig. 6A). In contrary, at host temperatures (37 degrees and 42 degrees) (Fig. 6A), the plasmidless strain produced less biofilm than the wild type strain, with the data being statistically significant (P<0.05) at 42 degreesC (Fig. 6A).\n\nBiofilm formation of different strains were compared at different temperatures: 7122 and its plasmid derivatives strains: No plasmids (7368), pChi7122 1 (7394), pChi7122 2 (7392), pChi7122 3 (7367), pChi7122 1,2 (7561), pChi7122 1 3 (7562), and pChi7122 2,3 (7274) (A),E. coliK 12 (6092) and its derivatives: pChi7122 1 (7346), pChi7122 2 (7347), and pChi7122 3 (7348) (B), and 7122 and its LPS derivative strains : rough mutant O78( ) (7145), smooth strains with either O1 LPS (O1) (7193) or O111 LPS (O111) (7167) (C) at either 30 degreesC, 37 degreesC, or 42 degreesC.\n\nThe biofilm formed by the plasmid cured strain, highly produced at 30 degreesC (Fig. 6A), is probably promoted by no plasmidic factors preferentially expressed at 30 degreesC and at early stage of biofilm formation; among them curli required for development of biofilm and adhesion[69]. Expression of biofilm in the environment (30 degreesC) would be beneficial for plasmidless strains; in these conditions, biofilm will allow these bacteria to be in close proximity with other bacterial species and acquire transmissible genetic elements.\n\nIt has been shown that conjugative plasmids promote bacterial biofilm formation by generating F pili mating pairs, which is important for early biofilm formation[70],[71],[72]. In this report, we have shown that plasmid driven biofilms are very complex and this complexity is related to the nature of the plasmids, their combinations, host strain backgrounds, and the temperature to which the strains are exposed. The presence of the three plasmids pChi7122 1, pChi7122 2, and pChi7122 3 in the wild type strain (Fig. 6A) and pChi7122 3 in theE. coliK 12 strain (Fig. 6B), had increased biofilm formation at host temperature conditions, with data being significant at 42 degreesC (P<0.05) (Fig. 6B). The fact that pChi7122 3 driven enhancement of bacterial biofilm was higher than those of pChi7122 2 and pChi7122 1 in both wild type and theE. coliK 12 backgrounds could be related to not only thetragenes expression[70],[71],[72]but also to the type IV fimbriae encoded by pChi7122 3, which was previously associated with the biofilm formation in enteroaggregativeE. coli[73]. Plasmid driven biofilms could be essential in the virulence process by giving bacteria a survival advantage in different niches of the host, which could result in disease.\n\nA controversy exists regarding the role of LPS in bacterial biofilm formation[74],[75]. In this study, we have shown that the three plasmids pChi7122 1, pChi7122 2, and pChi7122 3 in wild type derivative strains with different O LPS backgrounds behaved differently in their biofilm formation (Fig. 6C). In absence of O78 LPS, the rough strain produced significantly (P<0.0001) less biofilm than its smooth wild type strain at 30 degreesC. Even though substitution of O78 LPS with O111 LPS had little effect on biofilm formation, the substitution of O78 LPS with O1 LPS has in contrary greatly enhanced biofilm formation in these bacteria at 30 degreesC. Since the O1 LPS driven enhancement of bacteria biofilm occurs at 30 degreesC condition and is repressed at host temperatures (37 degreesC/42 degreesC), this indicates that its role could be more important in the persistence of bacteria in the environment, and that the temperature of 30 degreesC in early O1 LPS associated biofilm formation is necessary. The fact that O1 LPS driven biofilm is not highly formed at 37 degreesC and 42 degreesC (Fig. 6C), could be related to a change in the LPS O1 bilayer structure at higher temperature[76],[77],[78]leading to the disturbance of the early biofilm formed. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the effect of the nature of LPS on biofilm formation.\n\nA novel putative sugar utilization pathway operon that is not present in otherE. colistrains but found inSalmonellaserovars, an ABC iron transport system and a type IV fimbriaepiloperon were located on pChi7122 2 and pChi7122 3 respectively. Multiple plasmid encoded mechanisms, including toxin antitoxin modules and the novel sugar pathway could be important in the fitness and persistence of APEC 7122.\n\nLarge plasmids were involved in bile resistance (pChi7122 1 and pChi7122 2) when present inE. coliK 12 background and acid tolerance (pChi7122 3) in the wild type background. Four different factor driven biofilms, including plasmidless , plasmid , rough LPS , and O LPS mediated were demonstrated. These multiple factor driven biofilms expressed at different temperatures could have distinct functions. Some of them could be important in the acquisition of genetic material and persistence of bacteria in the environment; others could be involved in virulence. The genotypic and phenotypic analysis of plasmid derivative strains of an ExPEC model strain 7122 (O78K80H9) revealed new insights into the mechanisms of fitness of ExPEC and their diversity.",
    "discussion": "Genome sequencing has made major contributions to our knowledge of virulence and the evolution of pathogenic bacteria. So far, virulence plasmids associated with ExPEC are ColV, ColBM and Vir plasmids [20] ; many of which are already fully sequenced and have been determined as belonging mainly to the IncFIB/FIIA backbone. Although PCR characterization of UPEC and APEC plasmids has revealed the presence of plasmids from other Inc groups [21] , studies on their role in ExPEC has been limited. Previously, we examined the role of the three large plasmids of APEC 7122 in pathogenesis in chickens [12] and sequenced the plasmid pChi7122 1 [19] . We were able to assign roles for pChi7122 1 in the virulence in systemic infection of bacteria; however the roles of pChi7122 2 and pChi7122 3 in APEC 7122 were equivocal.\n\nGeneral sequence features of plasmids pChi7122 2, pChi7122 3, and pChi7122 4 In this study, we present the whole DNA sequences of plasmids pChi7122 2 ( FR851303 ), pChi7122 3 ( FR851304 ) and pChi7122 4 ( FR851305 ). The general sequence features of the three plasmids are listed in the Table 2 . Table 2. Summary of general characteristics of the three sequenced plasmids of APEC 7122.

Plasmids pChi7122 2, pChi7122 3 and pChi7122 4 consist of 82,676 bp, 56,676 bp and 4,300 bp respectively ( Fig. 1 , Table 2 ) and are predicted to encode 115, 86, and 3 coding sequences (CDS) respectively ( Table 2 , Table S1 and S2 ); these CDSs include the complete sequences for the iron acquisition system eitABCD on pChi7122 2 and type IV fimbriae on pChi7122 3, which have been previously shown to be present on these plasmids by PCR [12] . Analysis of pChi7122 4 revealed 3 CDSs that were predicted to encode plasmid replication and maintenance functions only ( Table 2 , Fig. 1 ); consequently we excluded this plasmid from all further experimental analysis. Figure 1. Circular representation of pChi7122 2 (A), pChi7122 3 (B), and pChi7122 4 (C). Open in a new tab The different rings represent (from outer to inner) CDS which are color coded by functional group (ring 1 and 2), deviation from average G+C content (ring 3), and GC skew [(G C)/(G+C); ring 4]. Colors represent the following: red, virulence associated; green, plasmid transfer; yellow, plasmid replication; grey other functions; brown, hypothetical protein. We assessed the presence of eitA gene of pChi7122 2 and two genes of pChi7122 3 ( pilS and pilV ) by PCR among 225 pathogenic E. coli strains from different origins, including 100 human E. coli strains isolated from the main clinical extra intestinal sources (50 UTI and 50 non UTI), 80 APEC, and 45 human enteric pathogenic E. coli . PCR results show that eitA was present in 10% of non UTI human isolates and 5% of APEC strains, but was absent in other groups. The genes pilS and pilV of pChi7122 3 were detected in 8.75% of the APEC group and in 10% of human UTI isolates, respectively. The low prevalence of pChi7122 2 ( eitA ) and pChi7122 3 ( pilS and pilV ) genes among other ExPEC of human and avian origin, as determined by PCR, could indicate the recent acquisition of these genes by these E. coli strains, enabling them to inhabit new niches. Our past work has determined that plasmids pChi7122 2 and pChi7122 3 are self conjugative [12] . Herein, their sequences analysis has revealed the presence of genes required for their transfer ( Fig. 1 , Table S1 and S2 ). The transfer region of pChi7122 2 is about 34 kb consisting of 24 tra and 9 trb genes ( Table S1 ) and is identical to the one of the virulence plasmid pAA ( FN554767.1 ; 99% identity with 92% coverage), whereas the tra region of pChi7122 3 has the same organization as its equivalent in E. coli conjugative plasmid IncI2 R721 ( AP002527.1 ); it contains 11 tra/trb genes, grouped in two clusters separated by two pil genes ( Fig. 1 , Table S2 ). pChi7122 3 also harbors genes nikB , nikC , and nikA for relaxome formation involved in plasmid transfer [22] , [23] ( Fig. 1 , Table S2 ). Among the three plasmids, only pChi7122 2 carries antibiotic resistance genes (MM2 101, MM2 102 and MM2 103) ( Table S1 ). These genes encode for a dihydropteroate synthase ( sul1 ) [24] , a GCN5 related N acetyl transferase [25] and a streptomycin 3  adenylytransferase (SP R) ( aadA ) [26] , respectively. The phenotypic expression of streptomycin and sulfonamide (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) resistance in strains containing pChi7122 2 has been determined by disk diffusion tests. Although streptomycin has only limited current usage in clinical medicine, it remains important for therapy of, and growth promotion in, animals and bacterial disease control in plants [27] . It was suggested that sulphonamide resistance genes can be transferred from commensal bacteria via integrons, transposons or plasmids, into more virulent bacteria in the intestine [28] . Comparative analysis of the pChi7122 plasmids with those in the public databases using BLASTn showed that pChi7122 2 shares high homology with plasmids from Shigella sonnei (pEG356), an urinary E. coli isolate (pHK01), EAEC (pAA), and K. pneumoniae (pKF3 70), respectively (with 100% identity and 70% coverage). The pChi7122 3 genome has shown homology with only one plasmid, the E. coli plasmid R721 (with 99% identity and 90% coverage), which includes the type IV fimbriae pil operon [29] , [30] and shufflon [31] , [32] . Mauve alignment of pChi7122 2 and pChi7122 3 with their respective homologous plasmids confirmed these homologies ( Fig. S1 ). The plasmid pChi7122 2 and its homologous plasmids have a 4 kb region in common, which encodes for the ABC iron uptake locus eitABCD ( Fig. 2A ), previously described in two other APEC plasmids, pAPEC O2 ColV [17] and pAPEC O1 ColBM [15] . A DNA comparison of the regions of eitABCD of the six plasmids has shown that with the exception of pAPEC O2 ColV, this region is located downstream of the par region of plasmids and is flanked by the transposon tnpA gene in pChi7122 2, pHK01, and pEG356 respectively and by an insertion sequence IS 629 in pAPEC O1 ColBM ( Fig. 2A ) which could explain the dissemination of eitABCD among genomes of these bacteria. We were unable to detect the iron uptake phenotype expression of eitABCD genes using CAS agar medium [12] , even though it was efficient in revealing those of pChi7122 1 and chromosomally encoded systems. Therefore in this study, we extended the analysis by testing the growth of strains, with and without the three plasmids, in iron limited medium alone or supplemented with either FeSO 4 , heme or hemoglobin. Our results show that only pChi7122 1 increased the growth of strains in iron sequestered environments ( Fig. S2 ). The ability to acquire iron from heme and hemoglobin could be related to the autotransporter Tsh encoded by pChi7122 1 [33] , which has previously been reported to bind to red blood cells [34] . Future studies are needed to determine conditions of expression of eitABCD , such as under in vivo conditions. Figure 2. Comparison of physical and genetic maps for eitABCD and sugar pathway regions. Open in a new tab The eitABCD region from pChi7122 2 was compared to its equivalent in pHK01 ( HM355591.1 ), pEG356 ( FN594520.1 ), pAPEC O2 ColV ( NC_007675.1 ), pAA ( FN554767.1 ), and pAPEC O1 ColBM ( NC_009837.1 ) ( A ); and sugars pathways genome region pChiA pChiOTDR in pChi7122 2 to its equivalent found in the genomes of S . Enteritidis ( AM933172.1 ), S . Gallinarum ( AM933173.1 ), S. Weltevreden ( FR775220.1 ) and S . Agona ( CP001138.1 ) respectively ( B ).\n\nNew putative sugar utilization pathways identified in pChi7122 2 An important aspect of pathogenesis is the ability of bacteria to adapt their metabolism to the available nutrients by coordinating their metabolism with their life cycle [35] . Recent reports have shown that in the intestine, both commensal and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) require multiple carbon metabolic pathways [36] , [37] . In this study, DNA sequence analysis of pChi7122 2 has revealed the presence of two systems of sugar utilization pathways. This system, with two divergent operons, consists of a gene for a starvation sensing protein ( pChiA ) located in the opposite orientation to four successive genes pChiOTDR ( Fig. 2B , 3 ). These genes have no significant homology with DNA sequences of other E. coli available on public databases, as determined by MegaBLASTn search analysis, but share 94% homology (with 100% coverage) with the chromosomal DNA sequence of genomes of Salmonella Enteritidis ( AM933172.1 ), Gallinarum ( AM933173.1 ), Weltevreden ( FR775220.1 ) and Agona ( CP001138.1 ), respectively ( Fig. 2B ). The sequence analysis of this region in these Salmonella serovars has determined that, with the exception of S . Agona, in which the pChiA  equivalent gene is truncated, the organization of the pChiOTDR homologous genes in the genome of the four pathogens is the same ( Fig. 2B ). The identities of the proteins translated by these genes were between 86% 99% ( Fig. 2B , Table S3 , and Fig. S3 ). Figure 3. Plasmid pChi7122 2 putative sugar utilization pathway. Open in a new tab Illustration of the proposed biochemical pathway for putative sugar utilization encoded by the operon pChiOTDR ( A ), the predicted 3D model and function of each enzyme are presented; and diagrammatic representation of the genetic organization of the putative sugar utilization operon pChiA pChiOTDR ( B ). The two promoter regions identified are indicated with arrows. Bioinformatic analysis indicated that pChiR may act as a transcriptional regulator of pChiOTDR genes. The promoter region contains independent CRP binding boxes indicated in red. The promoter elements for pChiOTDR (P pchi ) located in the positive DNA strand are underlined. The promoter elements for pChiA (P pChiA ) in the negative strand are in bold and red without underlining. The putative functions and the predicted 3 D structures of the pChiA and pChiOTDR gene products, determined by Blast PSI and HHpred [38] , show that pChiA encodes for a bifunctional dehydratase that utilizes both D mannonate and D altronate as substrates [39] and pChiOTDR encode for a gluconate 5 dehydrogenase, pChiO; an exonate sugar transport, pChiT; an L idonate 5 dehydrogenase, pChiD; and a regulator protein GntR like, pChiR, respectively ( Table S3 , Fig. 3A ). Two promoter regions, P pChiA and P pChi , with independent cAMP receptor protein (CRP) binding boxes [40] , [41] , were detected in the promoter region of pChiA and pChiO ( Fig. 3B ). Bioinformatic analysis indicated that pChiR is a putative transcriptional regulator from GntR family [42] . In the absence of glucose, the preferred carbon source for E. coli , the CRP would activate the pChi7122 2 sugars pathways [40] , [41] ; whereas pChiR would have an opposite effect. It is known that colonic mucus contains several sugar acids that represent an important source of nutrients and that genes involved in the catabolism of N acetylglucosamine, sialic acid, glucosamine, gluconate, arabinose, and fucose are expressed in both commensal E. coli and EHEC [36] . It has also been reported that UPEC bacteria grown in urine express enzymes for catabolism of sialic acid, gluconate, xylose, and arabinose [43] and genes involved in the transport of gluconate and related hexonates are up regulated in S. Typhimurium in macrophages [44] , suggesting that the new pChi7122 2 sugar pathways could also be important either in the pathogenesis of APEC, as well as in Salmonella serovars Enteritidis, Gallinarum, Weltevreden and Agona or in their persistence in different hosts. Compared to the chromosomal E. coli K 12 L idonic acid pathway encoded by the gnTII genes, idnK idnDOTR [45] , the genes of the operon pChiOTDR of pChi7122 2 have no significant homologies at the DNA level and share some sequence identity at the protein level ( Table 3 ); moreover, the position of the gene of L idonate 5 dehydrogenase is different in the two distinct gene clusters. Intriguingly, the gluconate kinase gene, idnK , of GnTII pathway [45] is absent in the pChi7122 2 pathway and is substituted by the gene of the starvation sensing protein, rspA like [46] pChiA which is essential for survival of bacteria in limited nutrient conditions. The gene encoding the regulatory protein GntR in the GnTII pathways, exhibits no significant homology at both DNA and protein levels with its counterpart in pChi7122 2 ( pChiR ) ( Table 3 ). In this study, although we have shown that strains have better growth in media with glucoronic acid than with other sugars tested ( Fig. S4 ), there were no significant differences between strains with and without the plasmid pChi7122 2. The functionality of the sugar utilization pathway genes located on pChi7122 2 would be more apparent in gntII  operon deleted strains [45] , or by evaluation of their expression under in vivo conditions, such as using the selective capture of transcribed sequences (SCOTS) method [47] . Future studies will be conducted to determine the conditions of their expression and their eventual role in both APEC and Salmonella serovars. Table 3.

However, a systematic analysis of ExPEC phenotypic diversity has not been done previously. In this study, the large plasmids associated phenotypes related to fitness of ExPEC bacteria as well the effect of host strain backgrounds were investigated. Intestines are suspected to be a primary reservoir of ExPEC strains causing diseases in both humans [50] and chickens [5] . To determine if large plasmids would increase the fitness of their carriers in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract environment, we assessed the ability of strains to colonize intestine cells and resist both acid and bile, attributes that allow enteric bacteria to live and persist in the intestine of their host [51] . APEC strain 7122 associates with and invades into intestinal epithelial cells without affecting the distribution of the tight junction protein ZO 1 Some APEC strains are genetically similar to human ExPEC, especially to uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) [52] , and could cause human diseases [53] . Herein, we investigated the ability of APEC derivative strains to associate with, and invade into, human cells of the kind that may be targeted by human ExPEC bacteria during their commensal life cycle in the intestine. The intestine is suspected to be a reservoir of ExPEC that cause infections in humans [50] . Since APEC strains are now considered as potential food borne pathogens that could be transmitted to humans via poultry products [4] , [6] , [28] , we aimed to investigate the interaction of APEC derivative strains with 3 D organotypic models of human intestinal epithelial cells. The 3 D model of intestinal epithelium used in this study has been shown previously to mimic the in vivo parental tissue more closely than monolayer cultures with regard to morphology and function [54] . The highly differentiated character of the 3 D intestinal cells is reflected in the presence of distinct apical and basolateral polarity, increased expression and better organization of tight junctions, extracellular matrix, and brush border proteins, highly localized expression of mucins, and multiple epithelial cell types relevant to those found in vivo [55] . Our data showed that APEC derivative strains were able to associate with, and invade into, human intestinal epithelial cells, and large plasmids did not have significant effect on these characteristics ( Fig. 4 ). Although tight junctions efficiently restrict most microbes from penetrating into deeper tissues and contain the microbiota, some pathogens have developed specific strategies to alter or disrupt these structures as part of their pathogenesis, resulting in either pathogen penetration, or other consequences such as diarrhea. In this study, evaluation of different APEC derivative strains for their interaction with 3 D human intestinal epithelial cells, showed that although these strains attached and invaded into these cells, they did not disturb their tight junctions, based on immunofluorescence evaluation ( Fig. 4 ). These data suggest that invasion of the intestine and dissemination would not occur through intercellular transportation of the bacteria, which could potentially disseminate through transcellular transportation, a mechanism used by meningitis causing bacteria, including E. coli K1 to invade brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) [56] . These bacteria could live as commensals in the intestines from where they shed and cause diseases in different hosts or other sites of the same host. Figure 4.

Role of plasmids in bile and acid resistance Mechanisms associated with bile resistance in bacteria are LPS synthesis, expression of efflux pump genes and regulatory genes such as marAB and phoPQ [51] . In this study, we have shown that all wild type derived strains tested were resistant to deoxycholate (DOC), one of the most abundant bile salts in humans (data not shown); whereas the group of strains derived from E. coli K 12 behaved differently ( Fig. 5A ). Although, E. coli K 12 was sensitive to the bile, its plasmid derivative strains 7346 (pChi7122 1) and 7347 (pChi7122 2) had increased survival in LB agar media with 1% (w/v) DOC as compared to their parent 6092. The strain 7348 (pChi7122 3) was as sensitive to bile as its parent strain 6092 ( Fig. 5A ). According to our results APEC 7122 strain better tolerates the presence of bile salts in the media then E. coli K 12 which was sensitive to the detergent ( Fig. 5 , data of wild type not shown). The mechanism of resistance of APEC could be both LPS and plasmid related. In fact, the detection of plasmid associated resistance in E. coli K 12 background but not in the wild type background strains, could be related to the presence of other factors, including the LPS in these strains that has masked the effect of plasmids on this phenomenon; this statement is supported by the resistance of the rough mutant which is usually hypersensitive to bile [57] . The mechanism of resistance encoded by the plasmid pChi7122 1 could be associated with proteins such as OmpT that was previously associated with bile resistance in Vibrio cholerae [58] and ABC transport proteins that are known to play a role in the protection of cells from toxic compounds [59] . Since such factors are not located on pChi7122 2, other factors predicted to be encoded by this plasmid, such as TA modules could be involved in bile tolerance of bacteria; as TA systems are now known to play an important role in bacterial stress physiology [60] , [61] , [62] . To our knowledge, this is the first time that plasmids have been shown to be associated with the bile resistance of E. coli . Figure 5. Bile and acid tolerance of strains. Open in a new tab Bile sensitivity assay for E. coli K 12 and derivatives, no plasmids (6092), pChi7122 1 (7346), pChi7122 2 (7347), and pChi7122 3 (7348). Five microliters of serial ten fold dilutions of each strain were spotted on both LB and LB +1% (w/v) DOC agar plates. The approximate numbers of bacteria present in each dilution are indicated on the right side of the plate ( A ). Percent acid survival of wild type derivative strains in acid shock for 18 hours ( B ). Abbreviations used are: pChi7122 1,2,3=pChi7122 1, pChi7122 2, and pChi7122 3; pChi7122 1,2=pChi7122 1 and pChi7122 2; pChi7122 1,3=pChi7122 1 and pChi7122 3; pChi7122 2 3=pChi7122 2 and pChi7122 3. Acid resistance is important for bacterial survival in acidic stomach or in foods with low pH [63] . Our results have shown that plasmids do not have any effect on the growth of the wild type derived strains when grown in acidic medium for a short period (12 hours), as the strains with and without plasmids grew similarly (data not shown). However, at longer incubation times (18 hours), strains behaved differently ( Fig. 5B ). Similar to the study by Lim et al . [64] on the plasmid pO157 in E. coli O157, we have shown that in the absence of its three plasmids, the APEC strain survived better in acidic conditions than in their presence when incubated for 18 h. Moreover, our study showed that although the plasmid pChi7122 1, either alone or in combination with pChi7122 2 or pChi7122 3, decreased the acid tolerance of bacteria, the presence of pChi7122 3 had the opposite effect ( Fig. 5B ). Since pChi7122 1 and pO157 play a major role in the virulence of APEC [12] and E. coli O157 [64] respectively, these findings could indicate that the presence of plasmids exert a cost to bacterial fitness when exposed for a long period (>18 hours) to acidic conditions, whereas bacteria containing other plasmids such as pChi7122 3 in 7122 would have better survivability in these conditions. Elucidation of the mechanism of acid tolerance associated with pChi7122 3 is needed to fully understanding the persistence of E. coli in acidic conditions. Our study also confirmed the importance of the full expression of O78 antigen LPS for the acid tolerance of E. coli [65] , and demonstrated that the nature of LPS had a minor effect on this stress response ( Fig. 5B ). Large plasmids increase biofilm formation at host temperatures Bacterial biofilm formation is a major concern in both medical and industrial systems. Biofilm formation is associated with many medically important pathogenic bacteria, as an estimated 65 80% of all human infections are thought to be biofilm related [66] . However, elucidating the mechanisms of biofilm formation necessary for establishing strategies for their prevention and treatments is becoming a matter of urgency. ExPEC cells are found in biofilm like communities in both gastrointestinal [67] and urinary tracts [68] indicating the importance of biofilms in the persistence of these bacteria. ExPEC bacteria have to adapt to extreme temperature changes. In this study, our strategy using three large plasmids, either individually or in combination in both an APEC wild type and an E. coli K 12 background, and different O LPS at different temperatures, has revealed new insights into biofilm formation of ExPEC. Altogether, our data distinguished four groups of factor driven biofilms, including plasmidless , plasmid , O LPS , and rough LPS mediated biofilms in E. coli which differ in their expression conditions. In general, the different strains tested formed more biofilms at 30 degreesC than at 37 degreesC or 42 degreesC ( Fig. 6A ). Compared to the wild type, the plasmidless strain produced significantly more biofilm at 30 degreesC ( P <0.05) ( Fig. 6A ). In the same conditions, the presence of the three plasmids, either individually or in combinations in the strains, reduced the level of biofilm formation to the level of the wild type strain ( Fig. 6A ). In contrary, at host temperatures (37 degrees and 42 degrees) ( Fig. 6A ), the plasmidless strain produced less biofilm than the wild type strain, with the data being statistically significant ( P <0.05) at 42 degreesC ( Fig. 6A ). Figure 6. Effect of plasmids, O LPS, and temperature on biofilm formation. Open in a new tab Biofilm formation of different strains were compared at different temperatures: 7122 and its plasmid derivatives strains: No plasmids (7368), pChi7122 1 (7394), pChi7122 2 (7392), pChi7122 3 (7367), pChi7122 1,2 (7561), pChi7122 1 3 (7562), and pChi7122 2,3 (7274) ( A ), E. coli K 12 (6092) and its derivatives: pChi7122 1 (7346), pChi7122 2 (7347), and pChi7122 3 (7348) ( B ), and 7122 and its LPS derivative strains : rough mutant O78( ) (7145), smooth strains with either O1 LPS (O1) (7193) or O111 LPS (O111) (7167) ( C ) at either 30 degreesC, 37 degreesC, or 42 degreesC. The biofilm formed by the plasmid cured strain, highly produced at 30 degreesC ( Fig. 6A ), is probably promoted by no plasmidic factors preferentially expressed at 30 degreesC and at early stage of biofilm formation; among them curli required for development of biofilm and adhesion [69] . Expression of biofilm in the environment (30 degreesC) would be beneficial for plasmidless strains; in these conditions, biofilm will allow these bacteria to be in close proximity with other bacterial species and acquire transmissible genetic elements. It has been shown that conjugative plasmids promote bacterial biofilm formation by generating F pili mating pairs, which is important for early biofilm formation [70] , [71] , [72] . In this report, we have shown that plasmid driven biofilms are very complex and this complexity is related to the nature of the plasmids, their combinations, host strain backgrounds, and the temperature to which the strains are exposed. The presence of the three plasmids pChi7122 1, pChi7122 2, and pChi7122 3 in the wild type strain ( Fig. 6A ) and pChi7122 3 in the E. coli K 12 strain ( Fig. 6B ), had increased biofilm formation at host temperature conditions, with data being significant at 42 degreesC ( P <0.05) ( Fig. 6B ). The fact that pChi7122 3 driven enhancement of bacterial biofilm was higher than those of pChi7122 2 and pChi7122 1 in both wild type and the E. coli K 12 backgrounds could be related to not only the tra genes expression [70] , [71] , [72] but also to the type IV fimbriae encoded by pChi7122 3, which was previously associated with the biofilm formation in enteroaggregative E. coli [73] . Plasmid driven biofilms could be essential in the virulence process by giving bacteria a survival advantage in different niches of the host, which could result in disease. A controversy exists regarding the role of LPS in bacterial biofilm formation [74] , [75] . In this study, we have shown that the three plasmids pChi7122 1, pChi7122 2, and pChi7122 3 in wild type derivative strains with different O LPS backgrounds behaved differently in their biofilm formation ( Fig. 6C ). In absence of O78 LPS, the rough strain produced significantly ( P <0.0001) less biofilm than its smooth wild type strain at 30 degreesC. Even though substitution of O78 LPS with O111 LPS had little effect on biofilm formation, the substitution of O78 LPS with O1 LPS has in contrary greatly enhanced biofilm formation in these bacteria at 30 degreesC. Since the O1 LPS driven enhancement of bacteria biofilm occurs at 30 degreesC condition and is repressed at host temperatures (37 degreesC/42 degreesC), this indicates that its role could be more important in the persistence of bacteria in the environment, and that the temperature of 30 degreesC in early O1 LPS associated biofilm formation is necessary. The fact that O1 LPS driven biofilm is not highly formed at 37 degreesC and 42 degreesC ( Fig. 6C ), could be related to a change in the LPS O1 bilayer structure at higher temperature [76] , [77] , [78] leading to the disturbance of the early biofilm formed. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the effect of the nature of LPS on biofilm formation.\n\nConclusion A novel putative sugar utilization pathway operon that is not present in other E. coli strains but found in Salmonella serovars, an ABC iron transport system and a type IV fimbriae pil operon were located on pChi7122 2 and pChi7122 3 respectively. Multiple plasmid encoded mechanisms, including toxin antitoxin modules and the novel sugar pathway could be important in the fitness and persistence of APEC 7122. Large plasmids were involved in bile resistance (pChi7122 1 and pChi7122 2) when present in E. coli K 12 background and acid tolerance (pChi7122 3) in the wild type background. Four different factor driven biofilms, including plasmidless , plasmid , rough LPS , and O LPS mediated were demonstrated. These multiple factor driven biofilms expressed at different temperatures could have distinct functions. Some of them could be important in the acquisition of genetic material and persistence of bacteria in the environment; others could be involved in virulence.
