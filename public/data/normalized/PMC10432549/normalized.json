    "abstract": "The undesirable, yet inevitable, presence of bacterial biofilms in spacecraft poses a risk to the proper functioning of systems and to astronauts' health. To mitigate the risks that arise from them, it is important to understand biofilms' behavior in microgravity. As part of the Space Biofilms project, biofilms ofPseudomonas aeruginosawere grown in spaceflight over material surfaces. Stainless Steel 316 (SS316) and passivated SS316 were tested for their relevance as spaceflight hardware components, while a lubricant impregnated surface (LIS) was tested as potential biofilm control strategy. The morphology and gene expression of biofilms were characterized. Biofilms in microgravity are less robust than on Earth. LIS strongly inhibits biofilm formation compared to SS. Furthermore, this effect is even greater in spaceflight than on Earth, making LIS a promising option for spacecraft use. Transcriptomic profiles for the different conditions are presented, and potential mechanisms of biofilm reduction on LIS are discussed.\n\nSubject terms:Microbiology, Molecular biology, Aerospace engineering",
    "methods": "The reagents and hardware were prepared as described in Flores et al. (2022)18. In brief, the PBS was prepared with PBS pellets (Sigma Aldrich, Cat. P4417) and autoclaved. The 1X LBK medium was LB Lennox (Sigma, Cat. L3022) supplemented with 0.86% potassium nitrate (Sigma, Cat. P8291) and filter sterilized with 0.22um filters (Nalgene, Cat. 566 0020). LBK medium was prepared at 1.18X concentration to load in the hardware to account for dilution during experiment activation. The 11.4% PFA solution was prepared by diluting 16% PFA (Alfa Aesar, Cat. 43368) with PBS. When mixed with the sample it yields a final concentration of 4% PFA. The RNAlater (Invitrogen, Cat. AM7021) was refrigerated prior to loading it in the hardware to induce the formation of RNAlater crystals. These crystals were then pulverized and the RNAlater was loaded cold into the hardware. Preemptive formation and pulverization of the RNAlater crystals avoided the formation of long crystals during launch (4 degreesC) that could cause sample loss, early activation, and leaks by displacing the hardware chambers. After sample incubation, the RNAlater was still efficient at preserving RNA from biofilms18.\n\nBioServe's FPA housed in the Group Activation Pack (GAP) were used as both ground and flight sample hardware. The FPA hardware components were cleaned with 1% Liquinox (Alconox, Cat. 1201 1), coated with sigmacote (Sigma Aldrich, Cat. SL2), and dried at 100 degreesC for 30min to siliconize the glass and facilitate sample assembly.\n\nAll the biofilm experiments were performed usingPseudomonas aeruginosaUCBPP PA14 strain, which was kindly provided by Dr. George O'Toole. This strain was selected for the project to replicate the column and canopy biofilm structure previously observed in microgravity by Kim et al. (2013)31when growing PA14 biofilms over cellulose membrane. The results of the biofilms grown over cellulose membrane are reported in a separate publication20.\n\nThe bacterial inoculum was prepared with 6ml of LBK media inoculated with PA14 and incubated at 37 degreesC for 16h (final OD5950.706). The overnight inoculum was diluted 1:100 with PBS (final OD5950.001) to maintain cells in stasis. The diluted inoculum was used to load the second chamber of FPAs.\n\nBiofilms were grown on 1cm2material coupons of SS316 (MPPR 311 6), pSS316, and LIS. SS316 coupons were cleaned with 1% Liquinox (Alconox Cat. 1201 1). For the pSS316, clean SS316 coupons were passivated with citric acid (Sigma Aldrich, Cat. C 8385). Preparation of LIS coupons (silicon wafer impregnated with silicone oil) has been described in detail previously1,18,19. LIS coupons were not cleaned, to avoid removing the silicone oil, but they were prepared in sterile conditions. LIS's silicone oil layer (0.5 1.5um in thickness) has no bactericidal nor growth boost effect onP. aeruginosaPA1418.\n\nA total of 144 samples were prepared, 72 for flight and 72 for corresponding ground controls. All coupons were prepared in the same fashion. Each gravitational condition tested three material surfaces (SS316, pSS316, and LIS), three biofilm incubation times (1, 2, or 3 days), and two termination reagents (PFA for morphology analysis and RNAlater for transcriptomics) with four replicates per condition. Flight samples were sent to the ISS on the Cygnus NG 12 spacecraft.\n\nDouble sided tape (3M, Cat. 9731) was placed on the backside of the coupons to adhere them onto the inserts. Adhered coupons on inserts were installed in the FPAs and autoclaved. FPAs were loaded with 2.75ml of sterile 1.18X LBK and the first chamber was closed with a second insert. The use of solid inserts prevents gas exchange and forces anaerobic growth ofP. aeruginosa. The first chamber was incubated at 37 degreesC for 24h as a contamination check. Afterward, the second chamber was loaded with 0.5ml of the PA14 inoculum in stasis and closed with a rubber septum. The third and last chamber was filled with 1.75ml of PFA or RNAlater and closed with a rubber septum. Eight FPAs with the three chamber configuration were assembled into each GAP and transferred to 4 degreesC.\n\nSpaceflight samples were launched in stasis (in PBS and at 4 degreesC) to the ISS to avoid bacterial growth before microgravity conditions were achieved. Once in microgravity, astronauts Jessica Meir and Christina Koch activated the spaceflight samples by combining the first and second chambers of the FPAs, which introduced the inoculum into the culture media. Samples were incubated at 37 degreesC inside BioServe's Space Automated Bioproduct Lab (SABL) for the designated incubation times (1, 2, or 3 days) in anaerobic conditions. At the end of incubation, the third chamber was introduced to fix (PFA) or preserve (RNAlater) the samples in microgravity, and samples were transferred to 4 degreesC or  80 degreesC, respectively, until unberthing. Fixed and preserved samples then returned to Earth at 4 degreesC and  20 degreesC, respectively. Once on Earth, samples were stored at 4 degreesC (fixed) and  80 degreesC (preserved) until sample processing.\n\nGround samples were performed asynchronously, activating and terminating two hours later to replicate the order of flight procedures. The temperature profile of spaceflight samples was also reproduced for the ground samples. When spaceflight samples returned to Earth, all coupons (both flight and ground) were recovered from the FPAs and processed for morphology analysis (PFA) or transcriptomic analysis (RNAlater).\n\nDespite biofilms being the focus of our experiment, the planktonic cell culture of the samples was visually inspected with the naked eye for notorious changes between samples. In addition, the liquid cultures' optical density at 600nm (OD600) was measured. Samples were vortexed prior to measuring the OD600to avoid cell clumping. Due to spaceflight constraints and the interest of fixing the samples while in microgravity, it was not possible to measure CFU/mL at experiment's end. However, forP. aeruginosaPA14 in our experimental configuration, the OD600measurements allow correct distinction of the bacterial stages of growth and are correlated to the viable cell density (Supplementary Figures3and4).\n\nTo eliminate the planktonic cells, the coupons fixed in PFA were washed three times with 1mL of PBS which was slowly poured on the walls of the wells to avoid disturbing the biofilm. The samples were stained with PI [15uM] (PromoKine Cat. PK CA707 40017 diluted with water) for 15min and with FilmTracer FM 1 43 Green Biofilm [10ug/ml] (Invitrogen Cat.F10317diluted with DMSO and water as per manufacturer's instructions) for 30min under light protected conditions. After each stain the samples were washed with 1ml of PBS. Immediately after the wash, the PBS was removed and the stained samples were mounted onto glass slides; gorilla glue was used to adhere the coupon to the slide and the biofilm on top was covered with one drop of VectaShield HardSet Antifade Mounting Medium (Vector Laboratories, Cat. H 1400 10) and a coverslip. Mounted samples were stored at 4 degreesC for 20h protected from light prior to imaging, this allowed the mounting medium and glue to harden in order to avoid smearing the biofilm while imaging. Samples were imaged in groups of 4 per session (spaceflight samples with their corresponding ground controls in the same session).\n\nThe Nikon SIM/A1 Laser scanning Confocal Microscope (inverted) of CU Boulder Light Microcopy Core Facility was used to take four 125x125um Z stacks (30 40 slices with step size ranging from 0.1 1.5um, average 0.5um) per coupon, aligning the four fields of view to the center of the coupon. The biofilms were imaged with 100X SR Apo immersion oil objective (NA=1.49 WD=120um), using lasers 488nm (green, emission filter 500 550nm) and 561nm (red, emission filter 575 625nm). All images were acquired with 1.2 pinhole, laser power range (green and red=0.1 to 2.3), offset range (green= 48 to 4, and red= 45 to 6), and PMT HV range (green=3.0 to 86, red=2.0 to 82) using the NIS Elements software. Images were taken with laser powers that avoided photobleaching and HV sensitivity settings that maximized the dynamic range without saturation. Resulting biofilm images were pseudo colored with red (PI, nucleic acids) and green (Green Biofilm, lipids) for display with a linear LUT covering the full range of the data. Raw image files were used for quantitative analysis. First, Image J was used to merge both fluorescent channels and convert files from nd2 to tiff format. Then, the \"Slice Remover\" plugin was used to eliminate the slices with no biofilm signal from each Z stack. The \"Convert to OME Tiff\" macro was used to generate compatible files for analysis with the publicly available COMSTAT2 software90 92. COMSTAT2 calculated biofilm mass (um3/um2), thickness (um), and surface area coverage (%) of the biofilms with automatic thresholding.\n\nSamples preserved in RNAlater were thawed at room temperature and washed 3 times with 1ml PBS to get rid of any planktonic cells. PBS was removed and 1ml of fresh RNAlater was added. The samples were ultrasonicated for 15min at 40kHz, followed by 5min of vortexing to detach biofilm bacterial cells from the surface materials. RNA extraction was performed by University of Colorado Boulder BioFrontiers Sequencing Core and the sequencing by the Anschutz Genomics Shared Resource. The RNAlater with the suspended biofilm cells was centrifuged, and the pellet was used to extract total RNA using the Quick RNA Fungal/Bacterial microprep Kit (Zymo Research Cat. R2010). RIN values were measured for the RNA extracted (Supplementary Table12) RNA sequencing libraries were prepared using SMARTer Stranded Total RNA Seq Kit v3 (Takara Cat. 634485) and paired end sequencing was performed on Illumina NOVASeq 6000 with 40 million reads per sample (Additional Transcriptomic information presented in Supplementary Table13).\n\nTranscriptomic analysis was performed on CU Boulder's RMACC Summit supercomputing cluster. Raw sequencing files were checked for quality control using FastQC (version 0.11.9)93and multiQC (version 1.0.dev0)94. Then Illumina adapter contamination was eliminated using Trimgalore (version 0.6.6) with cutadapt (version 2.6)95, after which quality control was performed again. Trimmed reads were mapped to PA14 rRNA sequences to remove the contamination, the resulting unmapped reads were then mapped to the Ensembl Bacteria reference genome ofPseudomonas aeruginosaUCBPP PA14 (accession number GCA_000014625), both mapping steps were performed using Bowtie2 (version 2.4.4)96. The mapping results were sorted, indexed, and converted from .sam files to .bam files using SAMtools (version 1.11)97. The reads per gene were counted with Feature Counts (Rsubread package version 2.8.2)98, and differential gene expression analyses were done in an R (version 4.1.1)99with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0)100. Pathways enrichment analyses were performed online using ESKAPE Act PLUS101and the whole list of DEG (including <=2 fold change genes) per condition as input.\n\nMorphology data was tested for parametric assumption compliance using Shapiro Wilk and Levene's tests. The data did not comply with all the assumptions, thus non parametric tests were used for all statistical analyses. Biofilm biomass, thickness, and surface area coverage data was compared between groups using two sided Kruskal Wallis and Dunn's (with Bonferroni correction) tests to determine if differences observed were significant. Significant differences have the significance level specified in parenthesis or in the plot (minimum ofp value<0.05), while the non significant values correspond top value>0.05. Differential gene expression analysis was performed with DESeq2 usingp value<0.05 as significance threshold, except for comparison between SS316 and pSS316 which usedp adj<=0.05. Pathways enrichment analysis was performed with ESKAPE Act PLUS using a binomial test (FDR corrected) withalpha=0.05.\n\nFurther information on research design is available in theNature Research Reporting Summarylinked to this article.",
    "results": "The biomass, thickness, and surface area coverage of biofilms formed on SS316 were not statistically different from those of biofilms grown on pSS316 (alpha=0.05) at any incubation day (Supplementary Figure1and raw data in Supplementary Table1). Similarly, no morphological differences were observed between biofilms formed on the two materials (Supplementary Figure2) for either Earth based or microgravity cultures. In addition, there were no differentially expressed genes (DEG) between SS316 and pSS316 biofilms in any conditions tested (alpha=0.05) except for microgravity day 2 where pSS316 had 44 DEG (Supplementary Table2). Based on this, SS316 and pSS316 were pooled into one \"SS\" data set which is hereon compared and contrasted to that of biofilms formed on LIS.\n\nIn 1g, biofilms on SS grew throughout the surface with no marked boundaries, usually creating conglomerates that formed 'mounts' of biofilm with dispersed single cells in between (Fig.2a). Conversely, the few biofilms grown on LIS were restricted to certain areas with sharp edges, had a more compact appearance, and looked thicker (not significant) than those grown on SS (Fig.2b). In addition, the LIS surface showed individual cells or small multiple cell groups attached in random isolated areas and a thin layer of nucleic acids in the areas where there was no biofilm. Bacterial cells attached on LIS were often found growing in the perimeter or inside of a circle (as seen for 1 day old biofilms on 1g) as well as small, connected clusters. Overall, biofilms on LIS seemed to be restricted to grow in smaller areas than on SS.\n\nRepresentative confocal microscopy images of 1 , 2 , and 3 day old biofilms formed over SS and LIS. Nucleic acids were stained with PI (red) and lipids were stained with Green Biofilm (green). First row per material is a bottom slice image with side view panels of a cross section point in the biofilm (specific section marked by the orange lines). Second row per material is a volume view of the complete z stack image. Images correspond to biofilms grown in 1goveraSS andbLIS, or for biofilms grown in microgravity overcSS anddLIS. Negative controls of the material surfaces, stained with both PI and Green Biofilm stains, are presented in panel (e). Scale bars are 20um. Biofilms form without boundaries on SS while on LIS they have sharp edges. Biofilms had significantly reduced surface area coverage on LIS, especially in microgravity where biofilms were minimized and mostly present as small groups of cells. The thin layer of nucleic acids on LIS surface could be DNA, RNA, or both as PI does not differentiate between them.\n\nThe morphology of biofilms formed on SS in space was similar to that of the Earth controls, in that the space samples also exhibited a lack of clear boundaries and biofilm 'mounts' were also observed, albeit with bigger gaps between them (Fig.2c). Biofilms grown on LIS in microgravity did not form as many sharp, compact, and thick biofilms (only a few in smaller size) compared to those formed in 1g(Fig.2d). The thickness of these smaller biofilms decreased in time (p<0.001). Most of the surface of LIS was covered with a thin layer of nucleic acids (red signal from the propidium iodide (PI) stain). The PI did not partition to LIS's silicone oil in the absence of bacteria, nor did the Green Biofilm stain (green signal to label lipids) (Fig.2e) confirming that the signal on the biofilm samples corresponds to adsorbed nucleic acids on LIS's surface.\n\nThe PA14 liquid cultures in which the coupons were submerged became more turbid (turbidity correlation with viable cell count available in Supplementary Figure3) for the microgravity set than for the 1gcontrols (not significant for SS day 1 and SS day 2). Specifically, for the samples cultured for three days, when OD600in microgravity had an increase of 41.3% for SS (p=2.9e 08) and 23.4% for LIS (p=0.0204) (Supplementary Figure4and raw data in Supplementary Table3). In addition, it is worth noting that the color of the liquid culture changed as well. In microgravity, the cultures were light green on day 1, light brown on day 2, and light pink on day 3, while the ground cultures remained clear for days 1 and 2 and then turned light yellow on day 3 (Supplementary Figure5). The increased culture turbidity in microgravity could suggest more bacterial growth in general; however, microgravity biofilms exhibited the opposite trend.\n\nPA14 biofilms formed in microgravity had significantly lower (p<=0.05) biomass (Fig.3), and thickness (Fig.4) than those formed at 1g. This is true for both SS and LIS, the only exception being for the biofilms formed on LIS at one day of incubation, which exhibited no difference between gravitational regimes. In the case of SS, by day 3 biofilms formed in microgravity had only 17.6% and 53.6% of the ground control biomass and thickness, respectively. The same phenomenon was observed on LIS, where biofilms formed in space had 8.7% and 21.3% of the ground control biomass and thickness. Furthermore, biofilms formed in space covered significantly less surface than their 1gcounterparts (31.4% and 33.0% of surface area for SS and LIS, respectively) (Fig.5). The median values for the three parameters assessed are summarized in Table1and the raw data in Supplementary Table4.\n\nBiofilm mass plotted as a function of time (1 , 2 , and 3 day old biofilms) and gravitational condition.

For SS,n=8 biological replicates each imaged in 4 fields of view. For LIS,n=4 biological replicates each imaged in 4 fields of view.\n\nSSstainless steel,LISlubricant impregnated surface.\n\nThe SS and LIS biofilms on 1gappeared to grow in size with time, with the largest growth observed between day 1 and day 2 (Figs.2a,b,3,4,5). This trend also held true for SS in microgravity; although with a lower growth rate (Figs.2c,3,4,5). For biofilms on LIS in microgravity, there was little to no change in mass and surface area coverage as a function of time.\n\nBiofilms grown on SS were significantly different than biofilms grown on LIS in terms of mass and surface area coverage. On both Earth and in microgravity, at day 3, the median of biomass and surface area coverage in LIS was significantly lower (p<=0.001) than in SS biofilms (Table1).\n\nBacteria adapt to their environment through gene expression modulation. The mechanisms used by bacteria to adapt to changes can be observed in their transcriptomic profile. The following paragraphs compare 3 day old biofilms formed in microgravity against matched Earth controls (baseline) for either SS or LIS surfaces. When available, the PAO1 ortholog gene numbers are listed in the brackets at the first mention of the corresponding PA14 gene.\n\nFor SS, biofilms showed five DEG in microgravity with a fold change >=2 (Fig.6a,b, raw data in Supplementary Table5). Three had increased expression (rsmY[PA0527.1],rmf[PA3049],pchB[PA4230]), and the remaining two had decreased expression in microgravity (PA14_63220 [PA4782], PA14_21970 [PA3249]). A KEGG pathways enrichment analysis was performed to understand at a bigger scale the more subtle changes (including the <2 fold changes) caused by microgravity (Supplementary Figure6). No significant enrichments were found with >2 fold, but it showed the \"nitrogen metabolism\" pathway enriched (Supplementary Figure7) in the space samples (1.02 fold). In addition, analyses were focused on genes involved inP. aeruginosavirulence and antimicrobial resistance. DespitepchB(2.2 fold) being the only gene in the virulome differentially expressed >2 fold, the other five genes involved in pyochelin production also had significant increased expression in microgravity for biofilms grown over SS (Fig.6c):pchI(1.4 fold) [PA4222],pchE(1.9 fold) [PA4226],pchD(1.5 fold) [PA4228],pchC(1.9 fold) [PA4229], andfptA(1.8 fold) [PA4221]. There was no significant effect >2 fold in the resistome.\n\nTranscriptomic data from 3 day old biofilms grown on stainless steel coupons in microgravity with respect to 1g.aVolcano plot andbMA plot of differential gene expression.cHeatmap of normalized counts for relevant genes involved inP. aeruginosavirulome, significant differentially expressed genes with fold change >=2 in bold. Sample F16.5 was not considered an outlier because the expression of the rest of the genes was similar to the other samples and no problems were found in the quality control steps.n=7 biological replicates per gravitational condition.\n\nFor LIS, biofilms in microgravity had only one DEG   PA14_08190 ( 6.4 fold, raw data in Supplementary Table6) which codes for a hypothetical protein. This suggests that biofilms on Earth and in space formed over LIS have virtually the same transcriptome. Futures tests in microgravity should confirm if this holds true at the protein level and should consider studying the function of PA14_08190.\n\nThe following paragraphs describe the results of the gene expression analyses performed to compare 3 day old biofilms grown on LIS with respect to 3 day old biofilms grown on SS (baseline). The first paragraph focuses on results under Earth's gravity and the second paragraph for results in microgravity.\n\nOn Earth, biofilms grown on LIS had 310 DEG with a fold change >=2 (Fig.7a,b, raw data in Supplementary Table7) when compared to SS biofilms. The top five DEG were PA14_09380 [PA4218],pchC, PA14_06170 [PA1911], PA14_52500 [PA0909], andpchE; all with increased expression on LIS. Gene PA14_52500 is annotated as coding for a hypothetical protein and had the highest fold change (3.9) of all. Some of the genes that code for alginate production had significantly increased expression on LIS (below 2 fold):mucB(1.2 fold) [PA0764],mucD(1.1 fold) [PA0766],algR(1.5 fold) [PA5261],mucE(1.9 fold) [PA4033],mucP(1.4 fold) [PA3649]. The pathways enrichment analysis (Supplementary Figure8) showed the \"carbon metabolism\" pathway as the most enriched on LIS (1.1 fold) (Supplementary Figure9). On Earth, the virulome presented several genes of Hcp secretion island I (HSI I), type three secretion systems (TTSS), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and pyocyanin with decreased expression in LIS with respect to SS (Fig.7c). Conversely, almost all the genes involved in synthesis of pyochelin had increased expression on LIS (>2.5 fold):pchI(3.1 fold),pchH(2.6 fold) [PA4223],pchG(2.7 fold) [PA4224],pchF(3.1 fold) [PA4225],pchE(3.1 fold),pchD(2.5 fold),pchC(3.1 fold),pchB(3.2 fold),pchA(3.0 fold) [PA4231],fptA(2.6 fold). In the resistome, genenouJ[PA2645] had 2.2 fold increased expression on LIS. In addition, genes involved in apoptosis were differentially expressed on LIS biofilms,rpoS[PA3622] had increased expression (2.4 fold) and the antitoxinshigA[PA4674] and PA14_21720 [PA2489] had decreased expression ( 1.4 and  2.4 fold, respectively).\n\nTranscriptomic data from 3 day old biofilms.aVolcano plot andbMA plot of differential gene expression.cHeatmap of normalized counts for relevant genes involved inP. aeruginosavirulome, significant differentially expressed genes with fold change >=2 in bold. For SS,n=7 biological replicates. For LIS,n=4 biological replicates.\n\nIn microgravity, biofilms grown on LIS had 425 DEG with a fold change >2 (Fig.8a,b, raw data in Supplementary Table8) when compared to SS. The top five DEG were PA14_27520 ( 5.5 fold) [PA2826], PA14_44920 ( 3.1 fold) [PA1509], PA14_20060 (3.7 fold), PA14_51580 ( 4.0 fold), and estA (3.1 fold) [PA5112]. Three of these top five DEG code for hypothetical proteins that have not been characterized. In microgravity, no pathways were significantly enriched or depleted for LIS vs SS. Interestingly, the observations made on the virulome when comparing LIS with SS on Earth, remain true for biofilms on LIS in microgravity: HSI I, TTSS, LPS, and pyocyanin synthesis associated genes had reduced expression while genes associated with pyochelin and rhamnolipids had increased expression (Fig.8c) with respect to SS. There was no increased expression of alginate associated genes on LIS in microgravity, which differs to what was seen on Earth. In microgravity, the resistome of biofilms on LIS had increased expression ofmexT(2.3 fold) [PA2492] andgalU(2.1 fold) [PA2023], and decreased expression ofampD( 3.1) [PA4522]. Finally, when comparing LIS with respect to SS, no significant differences in gene expression ofrpoSorhigAwere observed in microgravity, but one putative toxin (PA14_28120 [PA2781]) presented a 1.4 fold increased expression. Shared DEG in both gravitational regimes of biofilms on LIS with respect to SS at day 3 presented in Supplementary Table9.\n\nTranscriptomic data from 3 day old biofilms.aVolcano plot andbMA plot of differential gene expression.cHeatmap of normalized counts for relevant genes involved inP. aeruginosavirulome, significant differentially expressed genes with fold change >=2 in bold. For SS,n=7 biological replicates. For LIS,n=4 biological replicates.\n\nChanges in the transcriptome between 3  and 1 day old biofilms provide insight into the biofilm formation process. The following paragraphs describe the results of the gene expression analyses performed to compare biofilms grown on SS for 3 days with respect to biofilms grown on SS for 1 day (baseline). The first paragraph focuses on results under Earth's gravity and the second paragraph for results in microgravity.\n\nOn Earth, 3 day old biofilms exhibited 115 DEG with fold change >2 (Supplementary Figure10a,10b, raw data in Supplementary Table10) with respect to 1 day old biofilms. The top five DEG at day three had decreased expression (PA14_40310 [PA1869],trxB2[PA0849], PA14_39700, PA14_10380 [PA4139],nirN[PA0509]). PA14_10380, the most differentially expressed ( 5.2 fold), codes for a hypothetical protein. With respect to day one, day three had increased expression of several genes involved in production of Psl extracellular matrix polysaccharide, in particularpslO(3.1 fold) [PA2245]. The pathways enrichment analysis (Supplementary Figure11) showed several depleted pathways at day three; \"sulfur relay system\" was the most depleted ( 2.0 fold) (Supplementary Figure12), followed by \"nitrogen metabolism\" ( 1.7 fold) (Supplementary Figure13). In the virulome of day three (Supplementary Figure10c) there was a reduction in expression of genes in the Las (lasA 2.2 fold [PA1871],lasB 2.3 fold [PA3724]) and Rhl systems (rhlA 2.3 fold [PA3479],rhlB 2.2 fold [PA3478]), and of genealgP/algR3( 2.1 fold) involved in alginate synthesis. Regarding the resistome on Earth, day three presented decreased expression of genes that code for RND efflux pumps and outer membrane proteins:mexH( 2.1 fold) [PA4206],ompA( 2.6 fold) [PA3692],opmD( 2.3 fold) [PA4208].\n\nIn microgravity, 3 day old biofilms showed 70 DEG with fold change >=2 (Supplementary FigureS14a,S14b, raw data in Supplementary Table11) with respect to 1 day old biofilms. The top five DEG at day three correspond to: PA14_40310 ( 2.6 fold),malQ( 3.1 fold) [PA2163], PA14_36650 ( 3.7 fold) [PA2159], PA14_72370 ( 5.1 fold) [PA5482] andpchF(3.2 fold). Again, the most differentially (under)expressed gene (PA14_72370) codes for a hypothetical protein. There was no systemic increased expression of extracellular matrix polysaccharides on day three in microgravity, but as on the ground, the genetrxB2( 2.3 fold) and the cytochrome c gene cluster (includingnirN 2.1 fold) had decreased expression. The pathways enrichment analysis (Supplementary Figure15) showed three depleted pathways at day three in microgravity; \"Porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism\" is the most depleted ( 2.0 fold) (Supplementary Figure16). In the virulome (Supplementary Figure14c),rhlA( 2.2 fold) was less expressed on day three (as seen on Earth) while all pyochelin associated genes had increased expression (pchI2.1 fold,pchH2.4 fold,pchG3.5 fold,pchF3.2 fold,pchE3.2 fold,pchR1.3 fold [PA4227],pchD2.6 fold,pchC2.8 fold,pchB3.3 fold,pchA3.5 fold,fptA2.5 fold). In the resistome,ompA( 2.4 fold) showed a reduced expression on day three in microgravity, as seen in the ground samples.",
    "discussion": "In this experiment, biofilm shape and general structure appearance was not affected by gravitational regime. Contrary to what has been previously reported for anaerobicP. aeruginosaPA14 biofilm growth in space31, we observed less robust biofilms in terms of biomass, thickness, and surface area coverage in microgravity with respect to 1g. In microgravity, the increased expression ofrmf, in charge of ribosomal hibernation32during stationary phase33, could be indicative of a substrate limited and byproduct abundant extracellular environment for biofilms over SS, as the one theorized to occur in microgravity for non motile planktonic cells34,35. Such an environment could be partially attributed to the increased planktonic cell growth in microgravity, increasing the accumulation of metabolic byproducts and depletion of nutrients, and potentially the cause of reduced biofilm formation. Proteomic analysis and functional analysis are needed to confirm these hypotheses.\n\nStarvation environmental conditions can trigger biofilm dispersal inP. aeruginosa36,37. However, the genes known to be involved in biofilm dispersion38 dipA[PA5017]39,40,rbdA[PA0861]41,nbdA[PA3311]42,43,gcbA[PA4843]44, andbdlA[PA1423]39 were not differentially expressed in microgravity. Thus, biofilm dispersal could be regulated by other gene(s) in microgravity. Potentially, the increased planktonic growth and decreased biofilm formation are not a consequence of biofilm dispersion.\n\nFor SS, the most DEG in microgravity wasrsmY. RsmY (small non coding RNA) controls broad gene expression inP. aeruginosathrough the sequestering of RsmA (gene repressor)45. RsmA targets the mRNAs of genesmvaT[PA4315],pchB,pchC,pchD, andpchE46and, those genes demonstrated increased expression in microgravity. We hypothesize that RsmY could be regulating some of the biggest transcriptional changes observed in biofilms grown over SS in microgravity. It is worth nothing that DEG PA14_63220 and PA14_21970 code for a hypothetical protein and a transcriptional regulator, respectively, that have not yet been characterized and whose functions could shed light to the changes observed in microgravity. Moreover, this could be specific for biofilms growing on SS, only for biofilms past microcolony stages, or both, as biofilms on LIS did not have increased expression ofrsmYin microgravity.\n\nOur results suggest potential increased virulence of PA14 3 day old biofilms on SS in microgravity through increased expression of pyochelin. Pyochelin is secreted to chelate iron for bacterial use47and the outer membrane receptor, FptA, internalizes it. In addition, pyochelin production in biofilms is characteristic of aggressive and chronic infections48,49. Proteomic tests should confirm these results at protein level and on different surfaces.\n\nThe green, brown, and pink colors of the liquid culture in microgravity could be attributed to the production of pigmented virulence factors such as pyoverdine (green brown to green yellow), pyorubin (red), pyocyanin (deep blue), pyomelanin (black)50. It appears thatP. aeruginosahad an increased production of pyoverdine in the first days which then transitioned to an increased production of pyorubin. Interestingly biofilms in microgravity had no increased expression of pyoverdine, so the green brown color in the liquid culture could be attributed to a higher production of this virulence factor by the planktonic cells. On the other hand, the pink color, possibly reflecting the production of pyorubin, could not be assessed as the genes involved in pyorubin production have not been identified in PA14, to our knowledge. These hypotheses need to be confirmed with transcriptomics and proteomics analyses of the planktonic cultures in future experiments. Nevertheless, the potential increased production of pigmented virulence factors ofP. aeruginosaPA14 planktonic cells in microgravity, when grown in nutrient rich medium, may pose a health risk for infections in space.\n\nRemarkably, LIS's biofilm inhibition on Earth, was even greater in microgravity. Not only were biomass and surface area minimized, but these parameters stayed almost constant in time for microgravity biofilms on LIS. Coupled with the significant biofilm thickness reduction in time in microgravity, contrary to the increasing thickness trend on Earth, LIS performance in space makes it suitable to reduce biofilm formation in spacecraft components. Previous studies with different LISs show that this type of surfaces greatly reduce the attachment of both gram positive and gram negative bacteria (includingP. aeruginosa)25,51 55. The liquid like properties of LISs are believed to be the essential for the bacterial attachment inhibition56. Interestingly, biofilm formation on LIS was observed only in areas without the nucleic acid layer. We hypothesize that the thin layer of nucleic acids (DNA, RNA, or both) contributes to attachment inhibition.\n\nNucleic acids have a hydrophilic phosphate backbone (negatively charged), and hydrophobic nitrogen bases57 59. It is possible that the interface between liquid culture and oil layer provided an ideal zone for DNA/RNA interaction, leading to their immobilization on the surface. It is well established that oil/water interfaces can capture protein and nucleic acids60; and in some cases, the surface forces are strong enough to denature proteins60 67. Characterization of the protein adsorption/denaturing process on oil infused textured surfaces, as LIS, remains to be done68,69. Thus, we hypothesize that the oil/water interface forces could be enough to destabilize extracellular DNA (eDNA), inducing conformational changes that result in its unzipping to ssDNA70, and that the DNA associated proteins can be denatured to expose the DNA charges. Such that the hydrophobic portions of DNA/RNA partition into the oil of the LIS, leaving the hydrophilic phosphate backbone facing toward the aqueous culture. The mechanism of nucleic acid adsorption onto LIS surface and the exact composition of this layer remains to be elucidated and more tests are needed to confirm this hypothesis.\n\nPseudomonas aeruginosa(negatively charged due to its LPS) could be repelled by the phosphates of the nucleic acid layer (Fig.9). Recent studies show reduced attachment ofP. aeruginosaon surfaces with covalently attached and adsorbed DNA71, and on surfaces with DNA poly(ethyleneimine) multilayers72.Staphylococcuswas also repelled by multilayer chitosan DNA coatings73. This hypothesis implies that DNA/RNA was released by the planktonic cells and attached to LIS early in the experiment. On LIS, biofilm's reduced expression of LPS related genes (on Earth and in microgravity) and increased expression of alginate (only on Earth) a secreted polyanionic polysaccharide that helps mask LPS's charge could be related to the presence of nucleic acid repulsion forces.\n\nBoth bacteria and nucleic acids possess a negative charge.aWhen the nucleic acids get immobilized on the LIS surface, this creates a layer of negatively charged molecules that can repel bacteria through ionic forces.bBacteria can attach to areas of the LIS where there is a gap in the oil coat, previously destabilized.cBiofilms form in these gap areas but grow with sharp edges due to the repulsive forces on the borders.\n\nIn solid abiotic surfaces, the deposition of eDNA is required for initial microcolony formation inP. aeruginosabiofilms74 77. The eDNA is located in the active migration zone of the biofilm and plays a role in its expansion78. Thus, the nucleic acid layer on LIS could represent a risk of delayed/increased biofilm formation for long term. However, it is possible that the orientation and immobilization of DNA/RNA plays a role in adhesion inhibition. In addition, the physics of bacterial interactions at interfaces (specially oil/water interfaces) is unclear and can differ from usual biofilm formation79. More tests with longer incubation periods are needed to determine the time limit (if any) of the observed biofilm inhibition on LIS.\n\nAlthough LIS is typically stable, it is possible that protein/RNA acted as a surfactant and led to destabilization of the oil80. The biofilm increased expression ofrhlCin microgravity could have resulted in increased rhamnolipid (biosurfactants)81production, contributing to such destabilization. Interestingly,P. aeruginosaplanktonic cells in microgravity have been reported to produce larger amounts of rhamnolipids and this could be the case for biofilms on LIS as well82.\n\nThe gene expression analysis of biofilms formed on LIS with respect to SS suggests several other hypotheses of mechanisms contributing to the reduced biofilm formation: (1) Increased expression of pyochelin genes (on Earth and in microgravity) and of rhamnolipid genes (only on Earth), which are produced in nitrogen limited environments83, could reflect exacerbated nutrient depletion in the extracellular environment of LIS biofilms in comparison with SS. It is possible that the lubricant oil could be self spreading over the biofilms19and thereby limiting nutrient transport. (2) Increased expression of rhamnolipid genes, includingestA, an esterase that promotes rhamnolipid production84. Rhamnolipids sometimes lead to biofilm detachment83. (3) Increased apoptosis as observed in previous spaceflight studies34. Apoptosis of biofilms on LIS could be mediated by the increased expression ofrpoSon Earth (global stress regulator), underexpression of antitoxins on Earth (higA, PA14_21720) or increased expression of toxins in microgravity (PA14_28120) with respect to SS. We acknowledge that transcriptome changes are not direct evidence of protein levels nor cell functions, and that more tests are needed to confirm these hypotheses.\n\nIt is important to consider that growing biofilms over LIS could affect virulence and antimicrobial resistance. However, predicting such an effect is complicated as there is gene expression evidence for increasing and decreasing effects compared to SS. On one side, biofilms on LIS had increased expression of the virulence factors pyochelin and rhamnolipids. On the other side, biofilms on LIS presented a general decreased expression of type 6 secretion systems from the HSI I loci, which could make them less capable of establishing chronic infections85.\n\nLIS seems to prevent the first stage of biofilm formation: cell attachment. Nevertheless, more tests and analysis are needed to fully understand the mechanisms behind this phenomenon. In parallel, elucidating the functions of the uncharacterized genes that were differentially expressed on LIS with respect to SS can provide further insight. Based on the minimized biofilm formation on LIS in microgravity, it presents itself as a good option for use in spacecraft components. In addition, the use of directly immobilized DNA/RNA over surfaces (e.g., using covalent bonding, physical adsorption, or streptavidin biotin immobilization86,87) should also be explored to reduce bacterial attachment and biofilm formation in susceptible spacecraft components.\n\nBiofilms on LIS in microgravity seemed to remain in the microcolony stage for days 2 and 3, which could explain the limited differential gene expression between 1 day old biofilms and 3 day old biofilms. 3 day old SS biofilm gene expression profile suggests a potential decrease in metabolic activity (reduced nitrogen metabolism) and quorum sensing signaling (reduced expression of Las and Rhl systems) with respect to 1 day old biofilms. Further tests are needed to confirm such hypothesis but it agrees with SS biofilm morphology, as expression of these systems decreases as biofilm height increases88.\n\nBacterial growth dynamics can differ in space with respect to behavior observed on Earth89. Hence, it must be noted that comparing bacterial cultures and biofilms from a given moment in time (e.g., \"day 3\") may be doing so at different stages of growth, e.g., in a gravitational condition it may still be at the end of exponential phase while at another it may already be stationary. Acknowledging the limitation of getting data from three instantaneous moments in time in our experiment, we recommend that future studies (i) acquire continuous data as possible, and (ii) also characterize the growth stage and gene expression of the planktonic cell culture. Staining protocols may be improved with the use of a third dye to target polysaccharides. Furthermore, future studies may interrogate our observations further by determining the precise composition of the nucleic acid layer observed on LIS. Future studies, namely those focused on spacecraft water processing assemblies may improve on the fidelity of their study by using Ersatz Wastewater formulation to replicate the wastewater as received on the ISS' system, extend the duration of the experiment to multiples of months as applicable, and the substrate material may be changed to that of the specific component being studied.",
