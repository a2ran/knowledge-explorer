    "abstract": "Mechanical forces including gravity affect endothelial cell (ECs) function, and have been implicated in vascular disease as well as physiologic changes associated with low gravity environments. The goal of this study was to investigate the impact of gravitational mechanical unloading on ECs phenotype as determined by patterns of gene expression. Human umbilical vascular endothelial cells were exposed to 1 gravity environment or mechanical unloading (MU) for 24hours, with or without periods of mechanical loading (ML). MU led to a significant decrease in gene expression of several adhesion molecules and pro inflammatory cytokines. On the contrary, eNOS, Caveolin 1 and  2 expression were significantly increased with MU. There was a decrease in the length and width of the cells with MU. Addition of ML during the MU period was sufficient to reverse the changes triggered by MU. Our results suggest that gravitational loading could dramatically affect vascular endothelial cell function.",
    "methods": "Human Umbilical Vascular Endothelial Cells (HUVECs; HUVECs Clonetics, Lonza) were cultured at 37 degreesC/5% CO2in EBM 2 Endothelial Cell Basal Medium 2 supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.2% (v/v) Gentamicin Sulfate and Amphotericin B, 0.2% (v/v) Heparin, 0.2% (v/v) Hydrocortison, 0.2% (v/v) rhVEGF, 0.2% (v/v) rhEGF, 0.2% (v/v) rIGF1 and 0.4% (v/v) rhFGF beta (Lonza, Walkersville, MD USA). Medium was changed the day after seeding and every other day thereafter. The HUVECs were used up to passage 12.\n\nConfluent HUVECs were trypsinized and seeded at 2million cells per 25cm2cell culture treated flasks with no underlying substrate. Upon reaching confluence, the cells were cultured in EBM 2 Endothelial Cell Basal Medium 2 supplemented with 0.5% FBS and 0.05% (v/v) gentamicin sulfate and amphotericin B, 0.05% (v/v) Heparin, 0.05% (v/v) Hydrocortison, 0.05% (v/v) rhVEGF, 0.05% (v/v) rhEGF, 0.05% (v/v) rIGF1and 0.1% (v/v) rhFGF beta. HEPES buffer was added to the medium at a concentration of 1.2% (v/v) to compensate for the lack of CO2and avoid pH changes. Each group contained five biologically independent samples. The control group was maintained at 37 degreesC in the CO2incubator for 24hours or 48hours. The mechanical unloaded (MU) group was placed in a Random Positioning Machine (RPM, see below) for 24hours or 48hours. The mechanical loaded (ML) group was placed in the RPM for 24hours and was exposed to a 30minutes load period of mechanical stress (hypergravity) with centrifugal forces of 12G at the 4, 8 and 23.5 hour time points. For the control and MU groups cultured for 48hours, the serum concentration was increased at 2% at the 24hours time point, while growth factor additives were at  normal concentration. At 24hours or 48hours, all groups were harvested and stored at  80 degreesC for RNA isolation or fixed for immunofluorescent labeling.\n\nThe nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor L NG Nitroarginine Methyl Ester (L NAME) Hydrochloride (Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI USA) was added to the medium at a concentration of 10mM at the beginning of the 24hours. Nitrite concentration was measured in the cell media collected at the end of the experiment using the Ultrasensitive Colorimetric NOS Assay Kit (Oxford Biomedical Research, Oxford, MI USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol.\n\nIn order to mechanically unload cells, a random positioning machine (RPM) was used to minimize the gravitational gradient mechanically sensed by ECs. A desktop RPM described by Huijser55and manufactured by Fokker Space was used to provide mechanical unloading. The RPM is 30 x 30 x 30cm that was placed into an incubator at 37 degreesC. The RPM has inner and outer frames that are independently controlled by two different motors and is operated in random modes of speed and direction (0.1 2rad/s) via a computer user interface with dedicated control. The cell culture flasks were mounted on the center of the platform located on the inner frame. Under this experimental condition, the cells were exposed to mechanical unloading conditions ranging from 0.02 and 0.05g. For static 1 g controls, cell culture flasks seeded at the same time as the mechanically unloaded flasks were placed into the same incubator as the RPM samples.\n\nA cellular g loading apparatus was used for mechanical hyperloading as already described56. Damon/IEC model UV centrifuge (Needham Heights, MA, USA) was modified to become the cellularg load apparatus. A micro stepping drive system (SmartStep Microstepping Drive; Industrial Devices Corp.) coupled to a spindle and using timing belt and pulleys with a 3.14:1 gear ratio replaced the original centrifuge drive. Vibrations caused by S 23 stepper motor operation were minimized using pads made from sheet rubber mounted on the motor to the aluminum plate. The centrifuge was fitted with a SmartStep 23keypad and control unit (Industrial Devices Corp., Petaluma, CA, USA). Using Ideal Commands (version 1.1; Industrial Devices Corp.), the drive system was programmed to generate the effective centrifugal force (ECF) desired (ECF = 1+ teGs, where teGs = 1.118 x 10 5x cm x rpm2and rotor length is 19.28cm).\n\nThe mouse model of hind limb suspension was used to simulate mechanical unloadingin vivo57,58. The research protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Veterans Affairs Medical Center San Francisco. Three months old FVB/NJ mice were used. Hindlimbs of 8mice were lifted approximately 0.5 1cm off of the floor and beared no weight. The tail was cleaned with alcohol and sprayed with tincture of benzoin to make it sticky. Skin trac pre attached to a plastic bar with a small hook was then applied to the tail length wise. Filament tape was used to wrap the tail to prevent the Skin trac from loosening. The hook on the tail of the animal was finaly attached to a fish swivel and a rolling bar system that permited the animal free movement around its cage and free access to food and water. The animals were hung no more than 30degrees (as calculated by the angle of spine of animal to the floor with forelimbs extended) to minimize discomfort. Eight control animals were kept in identical cages to the experimental animals but without hind limbs suspension. After 14days of hindlimb suspension procedure, the animals were sacrificed, their thoracic aorta dissected, placed in RNA later and stored at  80 degreesC.\n\nRibonucleic Acid (RNA) was isolated using RNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Scrapped cells or minced thoracic aortas were resuspended in buffer RLT and homogenized using QIA shredder homogenizer (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA USA). Oligo d(T) primed cDNA was synthesized from 300ng of total RNA using MultiScribe reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA USA). Quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT PCR) was performed using 2x SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA USA) in a Bio Rad MyiQ Single Color Real Time PCR Detection System (Bio Rad, Hercules, CA USA). Gene expression level were quantified using the primers listed inTable 1and were normalized tocyclophilin (CPHI)internal standard. Five independent biological samples were used.\n\nConfluent HUVECs were trypsinized and plated on Nunc Lab Tek Chamber Slides (Fisher Scientific Pittsburg, PA USA). Immediately after the experiments, the cells were fixed with 3.7% Formaldehyde for 30minutes, then blocked and permeabilized in PBS with 1%BSA and 0.2% Triton X 100 overnight at 4 degreesC. Cells were then incubated with primary antibodies for 1hour at room temperature. Rabbit polyclonal anti human E selectin (20ug/mL, Abcam, Cambridge, MA USA) or Rabbit polyclonal anti human VCAM 1 (dilution 1:500, Abcam, Cambridge, MA USA) or Rabbit polyclonal anti human Caveolin 1 (dilution 1:250, Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO, USA) were used in combination with Hoecht dye (2ug/ml) and Rhodamine Phalloidin (2U/ml) (Invitrogen, Eugene, OR USA). After 3washes in PBS, cells were incubated with secondary antibody Alexa Fuor 488 Anti Rabbit IgG (H+L) (1:1000, Invitrogen Eugene, OR USA) during 1hour at room temperature. After 3washes in PBS, cells were mounted using Permount histological mounting medium (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) and imaged using a Zeiss Axioscope Fluorescent Microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany) camera and a (Hamamatsu Corporation, Bridge water, NJ USA) fluorescent microscope.\n\nUpon completion of the experiments, cells were washed 2times with PBS. Cells were detached from the 25cm2flasks using 5mM EDTA in PBS containing Ca2+/Mg2+, resuspended in ice cold PBS with 2% FBS and filtered with a 40uM cell strainer. Cells were blocked in PBS with 2% FBS containing 10% antibody host serum and 1% lgG/Fc Block (Sigma, St. Louis, MO USA). Cells were washed with PBS 2times and then incubated with monoclonal mouse anti human FITC Conjugated ICAM 1/CD54 (dilution 1:100), Monoclonal mouse Anti human Phycoerythrin Conjugated VCAM 1/CD106 (dilution 1:100, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN USA) and monoclonal mouse anti human PE Cy5 Conjugated E Selectin/CD62E (dilution 1:100, BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA USA). Cells were washed, resuspended in 200uL of PBS with 2% FBS and analyzed using a LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and FlowJo software (Tree Star).",
    "results": "To assess if exposure of endothelial cells to simulated MU has a significant impact on expression of adhesion molecules or inflammatory and angiogenic factors, we used quantitative RT PCR and flow cytometry to measure the levels of gene expression and presence at the cell surface respectively. We found that 24hours of MU leads to a significant decrease in the expression of adhesion molecules ICAM 1, VCAM 1 and E Selectin as well as inflammatory mediators IL 6 and TNF alpha (Figure 1a). This response remained similar after 48hours of exposure to MU (Figure 1a). Reflecting changes in gene expression, the presence on the cell surface of ICAM 1, VCAM 1 and E Selectin were also significantly decreased by MU at 24 and 48hours (Figure 1b).\n\n(a) Quantitative analysis by qRT PCR of gene expression in cultured Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC) placed in Random Positioning Machine (RPM) simulating Mechanical Unloading (MU) vs. ground controls (1G) after 24 or 48hours. (b) Quantitative analysis by flow cytometry of surface molecule expression on HUVECs under 1G or MU conditions for 24 or 48hours. Results are representative of five separate cell donors. Bars represent mean +/  SD. (n = 5, * p <= 0.05; with two tailed Student's t test against control samples).\n\nIn order to investigate a possible pathway involved in the regulation of gene expression of inflammatory and adhesion molecules in ECs, we studied endothelial NOS (eNOS), caveolin 1 and caveolin 2 expression levels. There was an increase in eNOS, Caveolin 1, Caveolin 2gene expression after 24h of MU (Figure 2a). This was also coupled with a significant increase in nitrite concentration in the media (Figure 2b).\n\n(a) Quantitative analysis by qRT PCR of gene expression of cultured Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC) placed in Random Positioning Machine (RPM) simulating Mechanical Unloading (MU) vs. ground controls (1G) after 24hours. (b) Measure of the Nitrite Concentration in the Media of HUVECs under 1G or MU conditions. Results are representative of five separate cell donors. Bars represent mean +/  SD. (n = 5, * p <= 0.05; with two tailed Student's t test against control samples).\n\nTo assess if an increase of NOS activity could underlie the changes in expression levels of adhesion molecules and inflammatory factors triggered by MU, we treated the HUVECs with the selective inhibitor of NO synthesis L NAME. Interestingly, the inhibition of NOS activity did not reverse the changes associated with MU (Figure 3), suggesting that NO production is not responsible for the decrease of adhesion molecules and pro inflammatory gene expression in this model. Compare to MU alone, the addition of L NAME to MU led to a decrease in eNOS and Cav 1 (although not a complete return to the levels seen with control) and an increase in Cav 2.\n\nQuantitative analysis by qRT PCR of gene expression in cultured Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC) subjected to 24hours of ground control conditions (1G) or Mechanical Unloading (MU) or MU with L NG Nitroarginine methyl ester (L N) treatment. (a) Expressions of adhesion molecules (ICAM 1, VCAM 1, E selectin), Cytokines (IL 6 and TNFalpha) decrease significantly when exposed to MU and MU + L N with no difference between MU and MU + L N samples. (b) eNOS, CAV 1 and CAV 2 expression increases significantly upon exposure to MU and MU + L N but the addition of L N decrease significantly the increase of eNOS and CAV 1 gene expression induced by MU alone. Bars represent mean +/  SD (n = 5, * p <= 0.05 with two tailed Student's t test against control samples, NS non significant).\n\nTo further investigate the causes of the molecular changes triggered by MU, we studied the effect of short reloading periods by applying mechanical loading (ML) to the ECs during the period of MU. Strikingly, three short periods of ML during 24hours of MU were sufficient to completely reverse the changes seen in adhesion molecules, inflammatory mediators, eNOS and caveolins (Figure 4).\n\nQuantitative analysis by qRT PCR of gene expression in cultured Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC) subjected to 24hours of ground control conditions (1G) or Mechanical Unloading (MU) or MU with 3periods of 30minutes of Mechanical Loading (MU + ML). (a) Expressions of adhesion molecules (ICAM 1, VCAM 1, E selectin), cytokines (IL 6 and TNFalpha) decrease significantly when exposed to MU but were not significantly decreased by the MU + ML conditions. (b) eNOS, CAV 1 and CAV 2 expression increases significantly upon exposure to MU but this effect was significantly reverted by the addition of ML. Bars represent mean +/  SD (n = 5, * p <= 0.05 with two tailed Student's t test against control samples, NS non significant).\n\nMU significantly affected the morphology of HUVECs. There was a decrease in the length and width of the cells with MU (Figure 5a). There appeared to be disorganization of the F actin network with clustering of the fibers around the nucleus. Addition of L NAME did not return the shape of the cells to baseline. However, paralleling changes in gene expression, addition of ML in the MU environment tended to reverse the shape of the cells towards 1G conditions.\n\nLabeling of cytoskeletal F Actin, nuclei, Caveolin 1, VCAM 1 and E selectin in Human umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC) with Rhodamine Phaloidin, Hoecht dye (HD) stain, anti Caveolin 1, VCAM 1 and E Selectin antibodies. (a) Both cell dimensions width and length significantly decrease under Mechanical Unloading (MU) conditions with and without L Name (L N), more so when cells are both mechanically unloaded and treated with L N. However, cell dimensions seems to be reversed or remains about the same as 1G control upon exposure to MU with 3periods of 30minutes of Mechanical Loading (ML). (b) Caveolin 1 adopt a perinuclear localization upon exposing HUVECs to MU and MU + L N compared to control but the effect seems to be reverted under MU + ML conditions. (c and d) Surface presence of VCAM 1 and E selectin tends to decrease upon exposing HUVECs to MU and MU + L N, more so when cells are both mechanically unloaded and treated with L N. Nonetheless, the effect tends to be reverted under MU + ML conditions. Bars represent mean +/  SD (n = 5, * p <= 0.05, ** p <= 0.01 with two tailed Student's t test against control samples). Scale bars: 50um.\n\nUsing immunofluorescent labeling, we found that caveolin 1 are less associated to the plasma membrane and adopt a perinuclear localization under MU compared to the 1G conditions (Figure 5b). Interestingly, the translocation of Cav 1 from caveolae to the Golgi apparatus has been shown to be responsible for an increase of eNOS activity in vascular ECs33,34. The exact localization of Cav 1 under MU and a direct link with the increase of eNOS activity need to be established. However, the disruption of the actin cytoskeletal organization by MU could impair the translocation of Cav 1 to the caveolae, and together with the increase of eNOS expression, could contribute to the increase of NOS activity. Addition of L NAME during the MU exposure had no effect on Caveolin 1 distribution, which remains perinuclear, however ML seemed to change towards 1G conditions.\n\nThe results of the immunofluorescent labeling of VCAM 1 (Figure 5c) and E selectin (Figure 5d) are consistent with the analysis by qRT PCR and flow cytometry (Figure 1) and show a decrease of their presence at the cell surface under MU condition. Interestingly, the process tended to go back to 1G conditions with the addition of ML.\n\nConsistent with ourin vitrocellular model, simulation of MU by hindlimb suspension led to a significant increase in eNOS and Caveolin 1 and  2 expression in mouse aortas (Figure 6). IL 6 also significantly decreased. Furthermore, there was a significant decrease in E Selectin expression. However, expression of other inflammatory or adhesion molecules did not decrease significantly with hindlimb suspension and ICAM 1 expression was significantly increased.\n\nMice were used as animal model in a hind limb suspension experiment. The tails of the animals were suspended to simulate physical inactivity and mechanical unloading. (a) eNOS, CAV 1, CAV 2 expression increased in aortic endothelial cells of suspended animal (HL) compare to controls (CL) as seen in the mechanically unloaded HUVECs. (b) IL 6 and E Selectin significantly decreased with simulated physical inactivity. Bars represent mean +/  SD. (n = 4, * p <= 0.05; with two tailed Student's t test against control samples).",
    "discussion": "In this study, we demonstrated that MU changes the morphology of cells and leads to a decrease in inflammatory gene expression (i.e. IL 6, TNF alpha), adhesion molecule gene expression and cell surface expression (i.e. ICAM 1, VCAM 1, E Selectin) as well as an increase in eNOS, nitrite concentration and an increase in Caveolin 1 and Caveolin 2 expression. We also demonstrated reversal of the morphology and gene expression towards baseline with three short periods of mechanical loading. Since alterations in gene expression were accompanied by changes in the cytoskeleton and both cell morphology and gene expression returned to baseline with the addition of hypergravity, our findings suggest that ECs gene expression and cytoarchitecture are tightly linked to gravitational mechanical forces, with a possible role for the caveolins35,36.\n\nThe present study demonstrates that microgravity alters the cytoskeleton of ECs. It appears that the actin filaments become disorganized and redistributed within the cells, with as a possible consequence an inability to transport molecules to the outside of the cells, such as the caveolins to the caveolae at the plasma membrane. Cells are known to stabilize their structure and shape by means of interconnected network of cytoskeletal components including microfilaments, microtubules, and intermediate filaments.In vitro, when subjected to shear stress in a flow loading device, net cellular movement happens orienting them in the direction of the shear stress9, a phenomenon accompanied by cytoskeletal reorganization with actin filaments rearranged into bundles of stress fibers and aligned in the direction of the shear stress10,11,12.\n\nIn microgravity, cytoarchitectural alterations of different endothelial cell lines have been reported to occur. Buravkova et al demonstrated changes in the cytoskeleton of HUVECs within 1 2hours of simulated microgravity with actin filament thinning and their redistribution to cell borders (with the central area becoming practically free of actin fibers while there was formation of continuous F actin band at the intercellular contact area)37. Siamwala demonstrated that 2hours of simulated microgravity in EAhy926 ECs lead to actin rearrangements and increase in nitric oxide production38. Versari et al also showed that HUVECs in microgravity for 96hours had disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and a decrease in the total amount of actin30. Infanger et al.39showed that EA.hy926 cells in microgravity had altered cytoskeletal components and the formation of cell aggregates in the monolayer after 12hours. Carlsson et al also demonstrated disorganization of the actin fibers with clustering of the fibers around the nucleus up to 96hr in simulated microgravity, then disappearing after 144hours40. Grimm et al41showed that EA.hy926 cells in microgravity formed tubular structures that actually had an increased amount of actin that covered the entire surface of the tubular structure.\n\nIt appears that expression and localization of key integrins that mediate EC attachment and spreading, such as the vitronectin and fibronectin receptors, could likely be involved in the changes seen in the cytoskeleton. For example, integrins have been shown to be decreased during parabolic flight in HUVECs42. The expression of fibronectin has been found to be increased with simulated microgravity in EA.hy.92643. Tube shaped structures of EA.hy.926 forming after 2weeks of simulated microgravity produced more fibronectin. Although not demonstrated in endothelial cells to our knowledge, Rho GAP expression has been found to be increased two fold with spaceflight in rat osteoblasts, suggesting that microgravity suppress Rho signals regulating actin filament rearrangement44. Since the cytoskeleton plays an important role in shear stress induced NO production and ICAM 1 gene expression by ECs with shear stress15,16, it could then be expected that MU also alters expression of eNOS, inflammatory and adhesion molecules.\n\nWe demonstrated in this study a decrease in IL 6 and TNF alpha expression with MU, which was reversed by hypergravity. This was coupled with a decrease in adhesion molecules ICAM 1, VCAM 1 and E Selectin, also reversed with hypergravity. Investigators have reported different effects of mechanical unloading or microgravity in the literature. For example, IL 6 was found to be increased45, decreased31, and unchanged46in separate studies, which may be related to different conditions. IL 8 was also found to be increased45and unchanged46in separate studies. Buravkova et al found that 12 24hours of simulated microgravity increased ICAM 1 in HUVECs but not VCAM 1 or E Selectin  in fact microgravity had opposite effects on ICAM 1 compared to VCAM 1 and E Selectin47.\n\nIn this study, we found that mechanical unloading led to an increase in Caveolin 1 and  2 gene expression. This correlated with an increase in eNOS expression and nitrite concentration. Our results are overall consistent with the forming body of knowledge on the effects of simulated microgravity on endothelial cells. For example, Spisni et al.48found that caveolin 1 protein expression was increased with 24hours of microgravity. With regards to NO production, two studies showed an increase in eNOS protein levels and increased NO production at 48hours and 72hours respectively30,31. However, Spisni et al.49found no change in eNOS or iNOS protein levels yet an increase in NO production at 24hours. Ulbrich et al.45actually found decreased eNOS gene expression at 24hours. Finally, Wang et al.50found increased iNOS protein levels at 24hours. Recently, Shi et al reported that HUVECs exposed to 24hours of simulated microgravity using a 2 D clinostat had an enhanced eNOS activity and promoted angiogenesis51.\n\nIt is likely that the changes seen in inflammation, adhesion molecules expression, eNOS and caveolins are mediated through a change in the cytoskeleton since the cytoskeleton is altered by MU and returns toward baseline with ML, along with gene expression. This study has important implications for spaceflight. It is well known that astronauts suffer from orthostatic intolerance (OI) upon returning to a gravity environment after spaceflight. It has been suggested that the nitric oxide system may be involved4. Our findings support a role of increased NO production in the pathophysiology of post spaceflight OI but more importantly, suggest that this variable may be improved by the addition of artificial gravity since 3periods of 30minutes of hypergravity in this study reversed the changes seen in microgravity.\n\nIn addition to the implications of our findings to OI, it is interesting to note that the changes seen would be considered \"anti inflammatory\" and possibly protective for early atherogenesis (Figure 7). This opens the way to explore new therapies to treat cardiovascular diseases by manipulation of cell phenotype using gravitational forces. Although the significance of the findings with regards to an overall \"dysregulation\" of the cells compared to a true change towards an anti inflammatory phenotype need to be further assessed, our findings would suggest that microgravity may have a beneficial impact on the health of blood vessels. It has been of important interest to know that astronauts are more at risk of immune dysfunction52,53,54. The changes in the vascular ECs could therefore be involved in the overall changes in the immune system seen with spaceflight. Our findings support the fact that the cells respond to altered gravitational environments, which could have an important impact on organ physiology.\n\nProposed model by which microgravity leads to changes in inflammation, adhesion molecules, caveolins and eNOS. Those changes are thought to be mediated through a change in the cytoskeleton.\n\nIn summary, gravitational mechanical unloading affects inflammatory and adhesion molecules expression in ECs towards an \"anti inflammatory\" phenotype. This is coupled with an increase in eNOS and caveolin gene expression. In view of the changes seen in the cytoskeleton and the reversal of both gene expression and morphology with exposure to ML, it is highly likely that this \"anti inflammatory\" phenotype is mediated through changes in the cytoskeleton. Our findings further support a role for caveolae as gravity sensing elements and demonstrate plasticity of changes with gravitational mechanical forces.",
