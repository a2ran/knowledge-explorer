    "abstract": "Microgravity (modeled by head tilt bedrest and hind limb unloading), experienced during prolonged spaceflight, results in neurological consequences, central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction, and potentially impairment during the performance of critical tasks. Similar pathologies are observed in bedrest, sedentary lifestyle, and muscle disuse on Earth. In our previous study, we saw that head tilt bedrest together with social isolation upregulated the milieu of pro inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus and plasma. These changes were mitigated in a MCAT mouse model overexpressing human catalase in the mitochondria, pointing out the importance of ROS signaling in this stress response. Here, we used a head tilt model in socially housed mice to tease out the effects of head tilt bedrest without isolation. In order to find the underlying molecular mechanisms that provoked the cytokine response, we measured CD68, an indicator of microglial activation in the hippocampus, as well as changes in normal in cage behavior. We hypothesized that hindlimb unloading (HU) will elicit microglial hippocampal activations, which will be mitigated in the MCAT ROS quenching mice model. Indeed, we saw an elevation of the activated microglia CD68 marker following HU in the hippocampus, and this pathology was mitigated in MCAT mice. Additionally, we identified cytokines in the hippocampus, which had significant positive correlations with CD68 and negative correlations with exploratory behaviors, indicating a link between neuroinflammation and behavioral consequences. Unveiling a correlation between molecular and behavioral changes could reveal a biomarker indicative of these responses and could also result in a potential target for the treatment and prevention of cognitive changes following long space missions and/or muscle disuse on Earth.\n\nKeywords:microgravity, CNS, hind limb unloading, microglia, ROS, MCAT",
    "methods": "In this study, a subset of the socially housed (2 per cage) sixteen week old female wild type C57BL/6NJ and MCAT transgenic mice was utilized as described in [20] and [48]. Wild type (WT) and MCAT mice were generated at NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) by crossing male MCAT mice, B6. Cg Tg (CAG OTC/CAT) 4033 Prab/J with female C57BL/6NJ mice (from Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA). Genotyping was performed using the Red'N Amp PCR kit following the manufacturer's protocol (Millipore Sigma, The Woodlands, TX, USA). All animal procedures were performed in compliance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC NAS 16 007 Y2) at NASA Ames Research Center (ARC).\n\nMice were assigned to one of four experimental groups (SeeSupplementary Figure S1; n = 8/group unless otherwise stated) and housed in a custom caging system as previously described [48]. In accordance with our previous work and with most space rodent studies to date, we chose females for this study. Socially housed, normally loaded (NL) controls were maintained in standard vivarium cages. All HU groups were acclimated for three days in HU cages prior to the onset of HU. Room temperature was maintained at a range of 23 24  degreesC with a 12 h light: dark cycle (6 AM:6 PM lights on:off). Food and water were provided ad libitum. Nestlets (Ancare, NY, USA) were provided for enrichment. Animal weights and food consumption were monitored throughout the duration of the experiment. Animals were euthanized 30 days after the start of HU via CO2inhalation followed by cervical dislocation.\n\nThe left brain hemisphere was flash frozen and a tissue biopsy (1.20 mm Harris micro punch) from the hippocampus was performed inside a cryotome chamber set at  20  degreesC to avoid thawing. Hippocampal tissue was then homogenized in a mild lysis buffer (Tris 50 mM, NaCl 150 mM, Igepal 1%, Protease Inhibitors (Millipore Sigma, The Woodlands, TX, USA) [49]. Samples were then centrifuged at 4  degreesC at 1000xgfor 10 min and supernatants were aliquoted and flash frozen at  80  degreesC until analysis.\n\nCytokine protein abundance in hippocampal homogenates was analyzed using a Mouse Cytokine/Chemokine Array 44 Plex MD44 (EVE Technologies, Calgary, AB, Canada) in which concentration standards are run for each cytokine. To verify the Multiplex method, IL 3 cytokine expression was validated by ELISA (Abcam, Cambridge, UK, Cat# ab113345 IL 3). Hippocampal cytokine levels were normalized to total protein content as determined by a BCA assay (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA, Cat# 23225). Blood was collected from the vena cava immediately after euthanasia. Undiluted plasma was analyzed for cytokine protein abundance as described for hippocampal homogenates. The results and raw data of plasma and hippocampal cytokines are shown in Rubinstein et al., 2021 [20], and used here for correlations.\n\nThe right brain hemisphere was embedded in 4% PFA overnight and transferred the next day into 30% sucrose PBS solution for cryoprotection. After sucrose impregnation, brains were embedded in OCT (OCT compound 4583, Sakura, Nagano, Japan) and frozen at  80  degreesC until cryosectioning. The brains were sectioned in a cryostat at 40 microns and stained for CD68. Slide mounted sections were 1x TBS buffered at a pH of 7.3 and washed in H2O2for antigen unmasking. Next, the primary antibody, rat alphamouse CD68 (Abcam ab53444, dilution 1:2000), was introduced in blocking buffered 3% Normal Rabbit Serum After additional TBS washes, the secondary antibody was introduced (biotinylated rabbit alpharat, dilution 1:200 (Vector BA4001) in blocking buffered 3% Normal Rabbit Serum). Amplification and fluorescent staining were performed with a Fluorescein Tyramide System (Perkin Elmer, Boston, MA, USA, NEL701A001KT), as described by the manufacturer. The indiscriminate nuclear staining agent 4,6 diamidino 2 phenylindole (DAPI, Vector Labs, Mowry Ave Newark, CA, USA Vectashield, H 1200 10) was used to identify hippocampal regions, and the Allen Brain Atlas was used for reference (http://mouse.brain map.org/) We chose to analyze 4 brains from each group except NL MCAT group in which 5 brains were analyzed, all with representative sections across the entire hippocampus (CA1/2, CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG)). We used 20X magnification, and 9 15 photos per hippocampus were taken. The unbiased microglia counting in each photo was performed manually counting microglia in each frame, using Image J program (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/).\n\nVideo surveillance: A commercially available surveillance system that allows for both day and night image captures was utilized. The Lorex 4K UHD 8 channel Fusion NVR Security System with 8 \"Smart Deterrence\" 4K Cameras was utilized. This cage system was designed to not disturb ongoing behavior. The camera was placed horizontally to the cage, and it is affixed to a surface at a distance enabling visibility and the capture of full ambulatory motion and all species' typical behaviors.\n\nVideo Sampling: Mice were recorded in their home cage continuously for a 24 h period, and samples of 15 min videos were analyzed using Excel to manually score the duration of various behaviors; time samples were at least 2 h away from the light to dark and dark to light transitions to ensure the acquisition of stable activity levels during each phase of the diurnal cycle.\n\nWe sampled 15 min from the following time points: 8 AM, 11:30 AM, 4 PM, 10 PM, 12 AM, 2 AM, and 4 AM. Each behavior graph represents the percentage of time the animal spent in engaging in a specific category from the total time measured.\n\nVideos images were manually scored in Excel and analyzed for a range of typical mouse behaviors that would indicate normal functioning. To obtain a more general behavioral profile, behaviors were pooled into the following categories: \"exploratory\", \"social interaction\", \"active\", and \"rest/sleep\":\n\nExploratory Behavior: burrowing in bedding, climbing, exploratory sniffing, and exploratory ambulation;\n\nSocial Interaction: chasing, sniffing another mouse, allogrooming, nestlet social engagement, mounting, socializing with another mouse, and pulling another mouse.\n\nActive Behavior: active behavior contains exploratory behavior, eating, drinking, sniffing, nestlet manipulation, self grooming, ambulation, and all social interaction behaviors;\n\nRest/Sleep: rest/Sleep behavior contains sleep and non directed movement.\n\nEating:Mouth is on food. Mouse has visible food in its forepaws and is using its mouth to interact with food piece.Drinking:The animal rears up and licks the nozzle of the drinker.Borrowing:Burrowing in its bedding, which involves the paws and snout and exploring different cage parts.Chasing:Normally loaded animals only. Movement 3 or more steps towards the other mouse, while the other mouse is moving away.Inactive:Stationary in one spot with most of its body not moving.Climbing:Using paws to grip on cage in order to lift body and paws off the ground.Sniffing other mouse:One mouse's nose in near proximity of another mouse.Alogrooming:Grooming that occurs when one mouse is grooming another mouse.Non directed movement (during rest/sleep):Movement that is localized to a few grids (3 grids) and does not use more than three fourths of the animal's body. Sustained for no longer than 2 s.Exploratory ambulation:Movement that includes sniffing and meets the definition of Stanford's four stages of exploration: search, attend, approach, and investigate while moving across multiple grids.Nestlet social engagement(described in Tahimic et al., 2019 [48]): In social HU, when one mouse extends beyond the halfway section of the shared cage and grabs a nestlet.Nestlet manipulation:Mouse directly touching nestlet with mouth and/or forepaws.Mounting:Normally loaded animals only. Mouse climbs on top of another mouse or has another mouse on top of it.Sniffing (exploratory):Moving ahead with the nose held in the air.Ambulation:Moving across multiple grids.Self grooming:Mouse licking its own fur or grooming with paws.With another mouse:Proximity and interaction between mice.Pulling another mouse:While one mouse is climbing, the other pulls it by its mouth.\n\nStatistical analyses were performed using JMP (SAS), Version 14.0.0. Equal variances across groups were evaluated by Levene's test. If variances were equal, a one way ANOVA with Tukey' ort test post hoc was performed. For datasets with unequal variance and/or non normal distributions, a non parametric Wilcoxon all pairs test was performed with statistical significance set atp< 0.05. Correlations were performed in JMP (SAS), Version 14.0.0. via multivariate platform and non parametric Spearman's  test. For all analyses, the threshold for statistical significance was set atp< 0.05.",
    "results": "Increased CD68 levels are indicative of increased microglial activation. Hippocampal sections were stained to visualize and quantify CD68 protein expression (Figure 1A). Wild type HU mice had a significantly greater number of CD68+ cells than normally loaded wild type mice (Figure 1B). Interestingly, MCAT HU mice had a significantly lower CD68 count than wild type HU mice (Figure 1B), indicating that mitochondrial catalase expressions can reduce HU induced microglia activations in the hippocampus.\n\nHippocampus sections were stained, and CD6 expressing microglia were counted to quantify CD68 protein expression.

In total, the expression of eight proteins (IL 1a, IL 3, IL 10, IL 12, IL 13, IL 17, RANTES, and MIP 3a) had a significant positive correlation with hippocampal CD68 counts (Figure 2). Five pro inflammatory cytokines were previously identified to be affected by [20], and three of these cytokines are among the ones shown here to have a significant correlation between CD68 counts and cytokine profiles in the hippocampus (IL 3, IL 12, and IL 17).\n\nCorrelation analysis between hippocampal CD68 count and changes in protein expression of hippocampal cytokines.

All groups showed increased active behavior compared to the light cycle, as expected. Only MCAT HU mice showed increased exploratory behavior during dark cycles compared to light cycles (Figure 3B). For social behavior, only normally loaded mice showed increased behavior during dark cycles compared to light cycles (Figure 4). All groups but normally loaded MCAT mice had decreased rest/sleep behavior during dark cycles compared to light cycles (Figure 5A).\n\nDuring the dark cycle, MCAT HU mice showed higher exploratory behaviors compared to wild type HU mice (Figure 3B) and higher active and exploratory behaviors compared to normally loaded MCAT mice (Figure 3A,B). For social behaviors during the dark cycle, wild type HU mice showed decreased behavior compared to normally loaded wild type mice (Figure 4), while MCAT HU mice also showed decreased behavior compared to normally loaded MCAT mice (Figure 4). For inactive behavior, rest/sleep activities of normally loaded MCAT mice were greater than normally loaded wild type mice, where MCAT HU mice were lower than normally loaded MCAT mice (Figure 5A). Moreover, for non directional movements during rest, wild type HU mice had more activities than normally loaded wild type mice, and MCAT HU mice had more activities than normally loaded MCAT mice (Figure 5B).\n\nNext, we assessed correlations between categorized animal behavior during dark cycles (in which animals perform most activities) and cytokine protein expression in the hippocampus and in plasma (Figure 6) with the aim to identify potential biomarkers of simulated microgravity consequences. In the hippocampus, correlations, either positive or negative, were observed in 12 cytokines. The activity category with the most correlations was explorative behavior, which was correlated positively with G CSF and Mip3a and negatively with INF gamma, IL 4, IL 10, IL 12p40, IL 12p70, M CSF, Mip2, and EPO (Figure 6). Next, social interactions were positively correlated with IL 4, Mip2, and EPO and negatively with G CSF, IL 1beta, IL 6, and Mip3a (Figure 6). Inactive behavior correlated positively with INF gamma (rho  0.03, data not shown). For plasma cytokines, active behavior was positively correlated with G CSF and KC and negatively correlated with Timp1. Inactive behavior was negatively correlated with KC and positively with Timp1 (rho  0.003 and 0.02, respectively, data not shown). Exploration was positively correlated with IL 20 and negatively with Timp1 (Figure 6).\n\nCorrelations between categorized animal behavior during dark cycles (in which animals perform most activity) and cytokine protein expression in the hippocampus and plasma.

    "discussion": "Microgravity experienced during prolonged spaceflight results in neurological consequences, CNS dysfunction, and potentially impairment in performances [51]. Rodent hindlimb unloading head down tilt models have been utilized in ground based studies to elucidate stress responses in numerous tissues, the immune system, and CNS [52]. Further investigations on the mechanisms of these responses are paramount for the identification of potential biomarkers as well as the development of future countermeasures. Previously, we found that isolation also may impact the response to microgravity by masking its effects [20]. Thus, in this current study, we were interested in assessing the effect of simulated microgravity (without isolation with mice socially housed) on a subset of immune responses of the hippocampus and behavioral outcomes.\n\nThe hippocampus is crucial for learning and memory, and any alterations in this region can have detrimental consequences on CNS function. HU in mice led to protein changes in the hippocampus, primarily in structural proteins and proteins involved in metabolism [53]. A previous study reported the upregulation of CD68 in the soleus [54] and increased microglia in spinal cord of male mice [18] that underwent HU. However, there remains a gap with respect to HU induced CD68 responses in the brain. We found, in female mice that underwent HU, increased CD68 in the hippocampus, indicating an HU induced increased activation of microglia. Deep space missions will expose crew members to higher levels of radiation in addition to exposure to altered gravity. The exposure of low doses of high LET radiation can induce inflammatory processes and can change cognition and behaviors [55]. Additionally, sex differences in cortical levels of CD68 and BDNF were observed in radiation exposure [56]. In accordance with our previous work and with most relevant space rodent studies to date [55,57,58], we chose females for this study. The additional reason for using females in our study was that, in studying male behavior, there are a lot of masking effects due to male to male aggression when housed in the same cage, and here, social housing was utilized. With the growing number of female astronauts, identifying these responses in females to space environment stressors is increasingly important. Sex differences are an important factor in the hippocampal stress response; thus, we plan to explore these responses to simulated spaceflight in our future studies and to assess if similar results will be seen in males.\n\nThere are several limitations of the HU model vs. spaceflight. During HU, the forelimbs, head, and upper back remain weightbearing vs. the entire body unloading in space. The HU model does not include the stress of launch and landing, and fluid shifts are not identical. Despite these limitations, this model is widely used and is instrumental in demonstrating physiological changes that occur during unloading [59].\n\nSleep and ROS quenching have a reciprocal relationship; when there is a lack of sleep, the accumulation of ROS might cause adverse effects [60]. Melatonin, a sleep inducing agent, decreased abnormal protein nitration, the accumulation of Abeta polypeptides, and extended the lifespan in mice Alzheimer's model brains [61]. In our study, as expected, mice rest less during the dark cycle; interestingly, in the WT MCAT group, mice were sleeping for the same period of time during the day and night, which could indicate a shift in their circadian rhythm. HU mice present more non directed movements during rest compared to WT, which is probably led by the discomfort of HU, and these differences will be investigated further in our future studies.\n\nChronic stress is a risk factor for various mental and degenerative disorders, both the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis and the sympathetic nervous system are activated and elicit glucocorticoids and noradrenaline, respectively. These stress pathways have both simulating and suppressant effects on microglia depending on the specific environment [62]. Cytokines not only target microglia [8] but are also secreted by them, and their interactions differ in normal (where cytokines work as signaling molecules) vs. pathological states, where these pathways may spin out of control (e.g., cytokine storm) and cause a cycle of chronic neuroinflammation. Acute and chronic stress, a known circumstance of prolonged spaceflight, have also been shown to induce microglia activation resulting in an enhanced release of pro inflammatory cytokines [10]. Mice that undergo HU have increased circulatory levels of corticosterone [20,48], an indicator of stress. We previously observed that HU resulted in changes in the expression of five hippocampal cytokines. Four out of these five cytokines (IL 3, IL 1beta, IL 10, and IL 17) were upregulated in HU versus NL mice, while IL 12 was downregulated. Additionally, HU elevated neutrophils and the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio [63] and IL 20 in plasma [20]. Here, hippocampal CD68 was correlated with eight cytokines and chemokines, primarily those involved with T cell responses, further indicating disruptions in the inflammatory status. Prolonged neuroinflammation is associated with cognitive deficits, mood disorders, and stress related behavior [64]. In this study, twelve hippocampal cytokines and five circulatory cytokines were correlated with changes in exploratory and social behavior during the dark cycle. Additionally, we saw that hippocampal IL 1, IL 13, and Mip3a have positive correlations with both hippocampal microglia activation and negative correlations with social behavior. Similarly, hippocampal IL 10 and IL 12p70, which are positively correlated with activated microglia, have negative correlations with explorative behavior. IL 1 and IL 6 have previously been linked to sick behavior and fatigue, [65] and when neutralized, they ameliorated specific neuropsychiatric symptoms [66]. IL 10 and IL 12 are both produced by macrophages and dendritic cells. IL 12 is strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory neurological diseases, such as multiple sclerosis. Mip 3a is a chemokine recently shown to have an important role in the autoimmune pathogenesis of the central nervous system. IL 13 has been shown to control brain inflammation by enhancing activated microglia death and enhancing neuronal survival [67].\n\nIt has been suggested before that there is an interplay between cytokines in the CNS and behavior, which probably evolved to promote healing and self isolating behavior to protect other individuals from becoming infected. However, when this balance is disturbed in age related cognitive impairments and/or mood disorders, similar immune changes are observed: for example, elevated CCL 11 plasma levels in schizophrenic patients [68]. The negative correlation of the cytokines found here with exploratory behavior, together with the elevated microglial state in the hippocampus, might illuminate similar pathways. It has been shown that IL 10 and IL 12 (P70) levels predict the risk of COVID 19 progression in hypertensive patients [69]; in s similar manner, these cytokines could be used as biomarkers for behavioral and molecular changes driven by neuroinflammation. It is still unclear if cytokines drive stress induced sickness behaviors or are a consequence of it, but since the impact of these changes is crucial to many behavioral pathologies, finding more links between immune and behavior changes is important for developing more specific therapies.\n\nAltered expression levels in the plasma that correlate with inactive behavior (Timp1 and KC) could be useful as biomarkers for astronauts or patients with sedentary lifestyle. The limitation of the correlations found in this study lays in its limited sample number; thus, these results must be verified in larger groups. Previous studies have shown that hindlimb unloading affects the blood brain barrier's integrity [70]; in future studies, it would be also interesting to assess whether peripherally infiltrating microglia such as monocytes are present in the brain of hindlimb unloaded animals.\n\nA prolonged inflammatory state has been linked to an increase in oxidative damage [71,72]. Spaceflight and ground based models have demonstrated oxidative stress affecting the brain and immune response, as reviewed previously [51,71]. Additionally, oxidative stress is associated with physiological and cellular changes in the CNS [71,73]. In an animal chronic social defeat, observed deficits in behavior were attributed to elevated levels of ROS and activated microglia. While activated microglia release pro inflammatory cytokines, microglia are also activated by cytokines released by damaged neurons. HU in mice has been shown to induce oxidative stress in the brain, resulting in lipid peroxidation and the activation of NF b [25], a transcription factor that induces the expression pro inflammatory cytokines. This in turn, induces the formation of ROS, resulting in increased pro inflammatory cytokines and microglia activation further perpetuating the cycle and a chronic inflammatory state. Therefore, we tested whether mitochondrial ROS is a potential mechanism for neuroimmune deficits caused by simulated microgravity. Previously we saw that mitochondrial ROS quenching reduced cytokine protein levels in the hippocampus and mitigated the effects of HU and of social isolation [20]. Here, we observed a reduction in hippocampal CD68 in MCAT mice that underwent HU compared to the WT, indicating an important role of ROS in HU induced microglia activation and that it is a potential target for countermeasures (Figure 7).\n\nA schematic cascade of the neuro consequences of spaceflight adapted from Mhatre et al. [48] with our findings highlighted (in orange oval).\n\nUnveiling a correlation between molecular and behavioral changes could reveal a biomarker indicative of these responses and could also result in a potential target for the treatment/prevention of cognitive changes astronauts experience due to prolonged spaceflight. Microglia activation may be suitable candidates for examining this relationship. Microglia have been implicated in a number of neurological disorders, including multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, strokes, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease [3], and they may be appropriate targets for prevention or treatment. Overall, our study sheds new light on the underlying mechanism of how simulated microgravity causes neuroinflammation, implicating microglial brain activation, and links this process to behavioral consequences. Additionally, we show that microglial activation in the hippocampus caused by simulated microgravity is mitigated by ROS quenching. Hence, in future studies, it would be interesting to investigate antioxidant treatments in both astronauts and patients with sedentary lifestyles.",
