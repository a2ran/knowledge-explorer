    "abstract": "Reduced gravity, or microgravity, can have a pronounced impact on the physiology of animals, but the effects on their associated microbiomes are not well understood. Here, the impact of modeled microgravity on the shedding of Gram negative lipopolysaccharides (LPS) by the symbiotic bacteriumVibrio fischeriwas examined using high aspect ratio vessels. LPS fromV. fischeriis known to induce developmental apoptosis within its symbiotic tissues, which is accelerated under modeled microgravity conditions. In this study, we provide evidence that exposure to modeled microgravity increases the amount of LPS released by the bacterial symbiont in vitro. The higher rates of shedding under modeled microgravity conditions are associated with increased production of outer membrane vesicles (OMV), which has been previously correlated to flagellar motility. Mutants ofV. fischeridefective in the production and rotation of their flagella show significant decreases in LPS shedding in all treatments, but levels of LPS are higher under modeled microgravity despite loss of motility. Modeled microgravity also appears to affect the outer membrane integrity ofV. fischeri, as cells incubated under modeled microgravity conditions are more susceptible to cell membrane disrupting agents. These results suggest that, like their animal hosts, the physiology of symbiotic microbes can be altered under microgravity like conditions, which may have important implications for host health during spaceflight.\n\nSubject terms:Microbiology, Zoology",
    "methods": "The strains ofV. fischeriused in this study include: wild typeV. fischeriES11484; the non motile, flagellated, mutantmotB1::Tn7ermR;and the non flagellated mutantflhA::Tn7ermR45. For all experiments,V. fischeriwas grown in seawater tryptone broth (SWT; 70% filtered ocean water containing 5gL 1tryptone, 3gL 1yeast extract, and 32.5mM glycerol) at 28C with shaking. Where appropriate, media was supplemented with erythromycin to a final concentration of 5 ug per mL. Retention of the transposon insertions in themotB1andflhAmotility mutants was verified for all experiments via soft agar motility assays85. For assessments of growth, the concentration ofV. fischeriwas determined by reading the optical density at 600nm, as an OD600of 1.0 has been previously shown by plate counts to correspond with 3x108cells per mL of culture84,86and was independently confirmed in the HARVs. To ensure that background levels of OMVs did not significantly alter the OD600readings, 1mL ofV. fischericulture was filtered to remove bacteria using a 0.22um syringe filter and measured spectrophotometrically. No significant (p<0.0001) difference in optical density was observed in the spent media from background SWT media.\n\nAll scanning electron micrographs (SEM) and transmission electron micrographs (TEM) were acquired at the University of Hawai'i Biological Electron Microscopy Facility. For SEM,V. fischeriwere grown in SWT media to mid log phase (OD6000.4 0.6) with shaking at 28 degreesC. For TEM, cells were grown under similar conditions in LB salt (LBS) media containing 10gL 1tryptone, 5gL 1yeast extract, 342mM NaCl, and 20mM Tris at pH 7.5.\n\nSamples visualized with SEM were fixed with marine fixative containing 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 2% paraformaldehyde, 350mM sucrose, 100mM sodium cacodylate at pH 7.6 for 1h. The cells were then washed in 100mM sodium cacodylate buffer containing 400mM sucrose and post fixed with 100mM sodium cacodylate containing 1% osmium tetraoxide for 1h. After fixation the cells were collected on a 0.22 um filter, then serially dehydrated in ethanol and dried with a Tousimis Samdri 795 critical point dryer. Filters were mounted on aluminum stubs and sputter coated with a Hummer 6.2 sputter coater, then imaged with a Hitachi S 4800 Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope with accelerating voltage.\n\nTEM was performed as previously described68. Briefly,V. fischericells were fixed, washed, and post fixed similarly to the samples prepared for SEM. FixedV. fischericells were then serially dehydrated in a graded ethanol series, infiltrated with propylene oxide, then embedded and polymerized in LX112 epoxy resin for 2 days. Ultrathin sections were stained with a saturated solution of lead citrate and uranyl acetate and imaged with a Hitachi HT7700 transmission electron microscope coupled to an AMT XR 41B 2k x 2k CCD camera.\n\nTo model the LSMMG environment, bacterial cultures were inoculated to a final concentration of 1x105cells per mL of SWT and then loaded into 50 mL capacity HARVs (Synthecon, Houston, TX), as previously described21,27. HARVs were incubated at 23 degreesC and rotated at 13rpm to mimic spaceflight temperatures and to prevent sedimentation of the cultures. Gravity controls were rotated around a vertical axis to control for HARV specific effects. To assess growth, the OD600of the HARV cultures were measured in triplicate every 2h using a Synergy plate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT). To examine the effects of LSMMG onV. fischerisize, cultures from each HARV were collected at 12h. Cells were stained with 1% crystal violet and analyzed with a Zeiss Axioplan microscope, using PROGRES GRYPHAX Image Capture software for measurements of cell length (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). To monitor motility of the LSMMG  and gravity treated cells, aliquots were also examined with both direct light microscopy video imaging using PROGRES GRYPHAX Image Capture software and soft agar motility assays as previously described85. All experiments were performed at least three times and outliers identified via the 1.5x interquartile range (IQR) method were removed prior to analysis87. A Shapiro Wilk test was used to assess data normality. Significance was determined via non parametric Mann Whitney U test using a cut off ofp<0.05.\n\nFor the quantification ofV. fischeri derived LPS, cells were spun down by centrifugation and the resulting supernatant was sterilized by successive passage through 0.45  and 0.22 um syringe filters. Reactionogenic LPS within the cell free filtrates was then examined using the ToxinSensorTMChromogenic Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) Endotoxin Assay Kit (Genscript, Piscataway, NJ) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For all samples, the absorbance at 545nm was used to calculate the concentration of reactionogenic LPS in endotoxin units (EU) per mL, which was subsequently normalized to the OD600of the culture to account for differences in growth between LSMMG and gravity conditions within the HARVs. For all LAL assays, 0.10, 0.25, 0.50, and 1.0EU per mL standards were run in triplicate.\n\nIn addition, total LPS was quantified using the colorimetric Purpald assay41with a Synergy plate reader (Biotek, Winsooki, VT). The Purpald assay is based on the sequential periodate oxidation of LPS core specific sugar residues and the reaction of formaldehyde with Purpald Reagent (4 amino 3 hydrazino 5 mercapto 1,2,4,triazole) to produce a purple colored end product41. For all samples, the absorbance at 550nm was used to calculate the concentration of total LPS in ug per mL, which was normalized by OD600to account for differences in growth. The test:control ratio comparing total LPS from cultures grown in LSMMG versus normal gravity conditions was then calculated. For all Purpald assays, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, and 500ug per mL LPS standards were run in triplicate. Outliers identified via the 1.5x interquartile range (IQR) method were removed prior to analysis and a Shapiro Wilk test was used to assess data normality. Significance was determined via non parametric Mann Whitney U test using a cut off ofp<0.05.\n\nTo isolate OMVs, 1L ofV. fischericultures were grown under LSMMG and gravity conditions in the HARVs. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation, and the resulting supernatant passed through 0.45 and 0.22 um filters (Millipore Sigma, Burlington, MA) to yield a purified, cell free, filtrate. On those OMV samples exposed to host animals, the vesicles were pelleted by ultra centrifugation (TL 100, Beckman, Brea, CA) at 173,000xgfor 2h at 4 degreesC to concentration the OMV particles. The pellet was then washed and resuspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 0.20M NaCl to yield a crude OMV extract. The OMVs in this extract were further separated from cellular debris by additional ultra centrifugation at 90,000xgfor 15h at 4 degreesC through a discontinuous 25 55% w/v sucrose density gradient. After, the fraction upward of 45% was collected and washed twice with PBS by ultra centrifugation at 173,000xgfor 4h at 4C. The final OMV preparation was filter sterilized through a 0.22 um filter. OMV yield was measured by protein assay using a Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All final OMV preparations were stored at  80 degreesC until use.\n\nThe concentration and size distributions of OMVs produced under LSMMG and gravity conditions were determined by nanoparticle tracking analysis using a NanoSight NS300 instrument equipped with a 488nm laser (NanoSight, Ltd., Salisbury, UK). Cell free filtrates from wild type and motility mutants at 12, 14, and 16h were diluted in PBS to achieve a threshold of 10 100 particles per frame. Prior to analysis, background values were subtracted from all measurements of concentration. All measurements were taken at ambient temperature (22 24 degreesC), with the settings for minimum expected particle size, shortest track length, and blur left at the factory default. For each sample, a minimum of 40 s capture videos was collected in triplicate, with the camera operating at the standard 30 frames per second. Between samples, the NS300 system was flushed thrice with PBS and once with deionized water. Further analyses to determine mean particle size, size distribution, and concentration were performed using the Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis software suite (NTA; version 3.2, NanoSight, Ltd., Salisbury, UK). Background particle concentration was assessed by diluting and analyzing sterile SWT. A Shapiro Wilk test was used to assess the normality of the nanoparticle concentration data. The normality of the OMV size data which contained over 10,000 measurements per condition was determined with a Lillifors test88. Significance was determined via non parametric Mann Whitney U test using a cut off ofp<0.05.\n\nSquid experiments were conducted in triplicate and in accordance with the University of Florida and Kennedy Space Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees. After hatching, juvenile squid was rinsed twice in 0.22um filtered seawater (FSW) and treated with either exogenous LPS fromSalmonella entericaserovar Enteritidis (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) or OMVs isolated from batch cultures of the wild typeV. fischeri. A subset of hatchlings was also rendered symbiotic by inoculation with the wild typeV. fischerito a final concentration of 1x105cells per mL of FSW. After 16h, the animals were anesthetized in a 1:1 solution of FSW and 0.37 MgCl2for 5min, containing 0.001% acridine orange dye. Light organ apoptosis was then examined via epifluorescence microscopy using a Zeiss Axioplan Microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Colonization was verified for all treatments by measuring bacterial luminescence with a photometer (GloMax 20/20 Luminometer, Promega Corp., Madison, WI).\n\nTo examine the effects of LSMMG onV. fischericell wall integrity, growth curves were conducted in triplicate in the presence of polymyxin B and SDS. Samples were collected from each HARV, normalized, and exposed to a solution containing either 1 10ug polymyxin B or 0.1 1.0% SDS per mL of SWT at 23 degreesC without shaking. After 24h of exposure, the samples were resuspended by pipetting and optical density was measured spectrophotometrically (OD600) and significance was determined via non parametric Mann Whitney U test for all readings of optical density. To measure the viability of cells treated with the polymyxin B or SDS a subset of cells was then diluted and plated on SWT media. Significance between treatments of plate counts was assessed using a Welch'st test with a cut off ofp>0.05.\n\nTo further assess the integrity of the symbiont cell membrane under LSMMG conditions, cultures were grown for 12h at 23 degreesC and pelleted in 5mL aliquots. The pellets were washed and resuspended in PBS and then incubated in 0.05% v/v Triton X 100, a non ionic detergent that disrupts membrane lipids48at 23 degreesC for 1min. Immediately after, the absorbance was read at 405nm and the percentage of intact, undisrupted, cells was calculated as the turbidity of the treatment group relative to the control. This value was then subtracted from 100% to obtain the percent lysis. The formula is as follows: Bacteriolysis (%)=(100% ((OD405of treatment/OD405of control)x100)). A Shapiro Wilk test was used to assess data normality whereas significance was determined via non parametric Mann Whitney U test.\n\nFurther information on research design is available in theNature Research Reporting Summarylinked to this article.",
    "results": "To determine the potential impact of modeled microgravity on LPS release during growth, cultures of wild typeV. fischeriES114 were grown in HARV reactors in the LSMMG and gravity positions (Fig.1d) and monitored at 2 4 h intervals. The growth curves were characteristic of several microbes cultivated under LSMMG, includingV. fischeri, exhibiting increased growth rate during exponential phase compared to gravity controls (Supplementary Fig.1)23,27,40. At each growth interval, theV. fischericells were removed from the culture media and the level of exogenous LPS shed by the bacteria was measured and compared using two independent assays. First, the colorimetric ToxinSensor Chromogenic Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) endotoxin assay, which measures the biological reactivity of the lipid A moiety of LPS, was used to measure reactogenic LPS in the cell free medium filtrate. The second method, the Purpald assay, is based on the periodate oxidation of sugars of the core regions of the LPS molecule41, and was used on the same, cell free media filtrate to quantify the total amount of LPS. Although complementary, these two assays target different components of the LPS molecule42.\n\nDuring exponential growth in the HARV reactors,V. fischericells released significantly more LPS under LSMMG conditions than gravity controls even after being normalized by optical density, an indicator of cell mass (Fig.2a). Levels of reactogenic LPS in the surrounding media, as determined by the LAL endotoxin assay, showed a pronounced increase beginning 10h post inoculation (Fig.2a). The significantly higher levels of LPS released from the LSMMG grown cells continued until ~18 20h, after which no differences in LPS levels were observed between the two growth conditions. Measurement of total LPS by the Purpald assay showed a similar increase, with the concentrations of total LPS shedding in LSMMG cultivars compared to gravity controls higher at all tested time points between 8 and 24h post inoculation (Fig.2b).\n\naReactogenic LPS as measured by the limulus amebocyte lysate endotoxin assay under gravity (light gray) and LSMMG (dark gray) conditions.bTotal LPS levels as measured by the Purpald assay between LSMMG and gravity (G) conditions. Error bars indicate the standard error of the mean. Asterisks indicate significant differences between the data sets (p<0.05; Mann Whitney U test).\n\nPrevious work has shown that most of the LPS released byV. fischeriis embedded in OMVs that are derived from rotation of the outer membrane sheathed, polar flagella35,36,43. This result led us to determine whether LSMMG stimulates bacterial motility, which would ostensibly increase vesiculation and, as a corollary, the shedding of LPS. Interestingly, the motility of wild type cells grown under either LSMMG or gravity conditions showed no statistical differences when examined using direct microscopic video analysis or soft agar motility assays (Supplementary Fig.2). In addition, we also compared the amount of LPS shedding by two motility deficientV. fischerimutants,motB1andflhA, grown under gravity and LSMMG conditions. Mutants defective inmotB1, which encodes for a flagellar motor protein, do form flagella but are unable to rotate them, whereasflhAmutants are defective in the synthesis of flagella44,45.\n\nThe motility mutants shed significantly less LPS than the wild typeV. fischeriES114 under both LSMMG and gravity conditions when normalized by optical density (Fig.3). In wild type cells, concentrations of reactionogenic LPS ranged between 5x104and 2.5x105EU per mL of media (Fig.2a). In the motility mutants, however, the levels of reactogenic LPS were ~10 fold lower at each time point tested compared to the parent strain (Fig.3a). By 14h, however, there was a significant difference between the level of LPS measured in the LSMMG and gravity conditions in the motility mutants. Like the wild type, LSMMG treated mutant cells exhibited significantly higher levels of LPS in both motility mutants compared to gravity controls (Fig.3a). In addition, themotB1mutants shed significantly higher levels of LPS in the LSMMG conditions compared to theflhAmutant at 14, 16, and 20h post inoculation (Fig.3a). These differences were also independently confirmed with the Purpald assay (Fig.3b) and suggest potential differences between the relative abundances between the components of the LPS molecule that are shed under LSMMG conditions.\n\naReactionogenic LPS as measured by the limulus amebocyte lysate endotoxin assay under gravity (light gray) and LSMMG (dark gray) conditions.bTotal LPS levels as measured by the Purpald assay between LSMMG and gravity (G) conditions. Error bars indicate the standard error of the mean. Asterisks indicate significant differences between the data sets (p<0.05; Mann Whitney U test).\n\nThe motility mutants displayed more modest growth increases compared to the parent strain, ES114 (Supplementary Fig.1a c) and to determine whether there were differences in cell size between the strains, cells collected from 12 h HARV cultures of wild type,motB1, andflhAmutants were stained with 1% crystal violet compare cell size under LSMMG and gravity treatments and observed with microscopy. Analyses of cell size revealed no significant difference between conditions or strains, suggesting optical density readings were directly comparable between LSMMG and gravity treatments for all strains (Supplementary Fig.1d).\n\nTo more fully understand the mechanics of increased LPS release under LSMMG conditions, the production of OMVs was examined under modeled microgravity. Almost all of the LPS released fromV. fischericells has been shown to be associated with OMVs, which are produced largely due to flagellar rotation35,36. Therefore, we also examined whether OMV number and size were altered under the modeled microgravity conditions. Cultures of the wild type,motB1, andflhAstrains were grown in LSMMG or gravity conditions and cell free filtrates were evaluated at 12, 14, and 16h post inoculation using nanoparticle tracking analysis. These times were chosen as they represent growth points with the largest discrepancies in LPS content between treatments observed across all three strains.\n\nNanoparticle analysis revealed a positive association between symbiont OMV vesiculation and modeled microgravity conditions. Specifically, the LSMMG filtrates of wild type,flhA, andmotB1were found to contain significantly more OMV particles per mL than the gravity controls (Fig.4a). Under both conditions, OMV concentration was observed to increase over time, with bothmotB1andflhAgenerating diminished vesicular yields relative to wild type cells (Fig.4a). In addition, by 14h OMVs derived from LSMMG cultures were found to be significantly larger than gravity controls (Fig.4b; Supplementary Table1; Supplementary Dataset1). At 16h, the average size of OMVs for the modeled microgravity cultures was 40.72+/ 0.092nm, whereas nanoparticle size averaged only 37.10+/ 0.092nm for gravity controls (Supplementary Table1). Similarly, in themotB1andflhAmotility mutants the means of OMVs from LSMMG treated cultures were 45.35+/ 0.068 and 43.05+/ 0.065nm, respectively, whereas the mean size of gravity treated OMVs was 40.72+/ 0.052 (motB1) and 38.16+/ 0.056nm (flhA). Differences were also observed in the abundance of certain sized particles. Gravity samples tended to contain a higher proportion of smaller OMVs (diameter<40nm), whereas those cultivated in LSMMG exhibited a more even distribution (Supplementary Fig.3). All isolated OMVs, whether they were derived from gravity or LSMMG conditions, exhibited a comparable ability to induce apoptosis and matched previously published levels of LPS and OMV induced cell death (Supplementary Fig.4)21,35.\n\naConcentrations of OMVs inV. fischeriwild type (ES114) and motility mutants (motB1andflhA)under gravity (light gray) and low shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG, dark gray) conditions.bAverage diameter of OMVs at 12, 14, and 16h of incubation under gravity (light gray) and LSMMG (dark gray) conditions. Error bars indicate the standard error of the mean. Asterisks indicate significant differences between the data sets (p<0.05; Mann Whitney U test).\n\nAlthough motility dependent vesiculation is characteristic of species with sheathed flagella, such asV. fischeri36, all Gram negative bacteria invariably produce OMVs by outer membrane blebbing. OMV blebbing is modulated by both external envelope stress and structural deficiencies in the bacterial cell wall46. Accordingly, the discovery that flagellar function does not, in fact, fully explain the model microgravity associated differences observed in LPS shedding or OMV release led us to hypothesize that LSMMG conditions may impact the integrity of the Gram negative outer membrane. To investigate this, the susceptibility ofV. fischeritoward a variety of cell membrane affecting agents was compared in cells grown under LSMMG and gravity conditions, for the wild type and motility mutants at 12, 14, and 16h. Three specific agents were used to disrupt different components of the Gram negative cell envelope. First, the cationic antibiotic polymyxin B was used, which binds to Gram negative LPS and weakens the packing of lipid A molecules in the outer membrane47. Second, cells were exposed to the anionic detergent sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), which disrupts ionic interactions and causes bacterial cytoplasmic membrane lysis at high concentrations48. Last, cells were also exposed to a dilute solution of Triton X 100 for 1min, which is a non ionic detergent that disrupts lipid lipid interactions49. After exposure, cell growth was assessed with optical density (Fig.5; Supplementary Figs.5and6) and plated to assess cell viability (Fig.6).\n\nCultures of wild typeV. fischeriES114 and motility mutants (motB1andflhA) were grown for 12h under gravity (light gray) and low shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) conditions.

Error bars indicate the standard error of the mean. Asterisks indicate significant differences between the data sets (p<0.05; Welch'st test).\n\nDose response curves with 1 10ug per mL polymyxin B and 0.1 1.0% v/v SDS revealed a concentration dependent effect on bacterial growth in both LSMMG and gravity conditions. This effect was more pronounced in the LSMMG treated strains at all time points tested (Fig.5, Supplementary Figs.5and6); LSMMG treatedV. fischerigenerally showed increased sensitivity to membrane disrupting agents. Despite showing different baseline sensitivities, the mutant strains also appeared more susceptible to the polymyxin B and SDS agents under LSMMG conditions compared to wild type cells at all time points tested, with the polymyxin B treatment producing the most damaging effects to the motility mutants (Fig.5, Supplementary Figs.5and6). Plating of cells treated with polymyxin B  and SDS treated cells revealed comparable results (Fig.6) indicating that, regardless of strain, the viability of those cells exposed to polymyxin B were more negatively impacted when grown under LSMMG conditions.\n\nSimilar results were also observed when cells were treated with Triton X 100. Cells of LSMMG cultivatedV. fischeri, regardless of strain, were also found to be more susceptible to the bactericidal effects of 0.05% Triton X 100, exhibiting more lysis than the gravity controls after 1min of exposure (Fig.7). To confirm that the results observed during these HARV experiments were not the product of changes to the background pH of the SWT media under LSMMG or gravity conditions, the pH was regularly monitored, and no significant changes to the pH were observed (Supplementary Fig.7).\n\nThe wild typeV. fischeriES114 and motility mutantsmotBandflhAgrown under gravity (light gray) and low shear modeled microgravity conditions (LSMMG) for 12h in response to 1min of 0.05% v/v Triton X 100 exposure and then plated.

    "discussion": "Over the coming decade, human led exploration of space will likely move beyond low Earth orbit into deeper space50. Maintaining astronaut fitness during these long duration space operations will require a detailed understanding of the microbiome under non terrestrial conditions. To address this emerging issue in space biology, we used the HARV platform to model the effects of microgravity onV. fischeri, a beneficial microbe known to form symbiotic associations along animal epithelia. Results from this study indicated that (i) LSMMG conditions increased the shedding of bacterial LPS and associated OMVs into the surrounding media; (ii) the size of the OMV particles released during LSMMG were larger than gravity controls; (iii) flagellar motility inV. fischeriaccounted for most of the overall OMV production, but was not necessary for increases in LPS shedding under LSMMG conditions; and (iv) the cell membranes ofV. fischericells were more susceptible to disruption when cultivated under model microgravity conditions.\n\nIn Gram negative bacteria, LPS is localized to the outer membrane and consists of a hydrophobic lipid A moiety, a core polysaccharide, and an O antigen, or outward projecting sugar chain of variable length51,52. LPS represents one of several MAMPs used by bacteria to either evade or communicate with their eukaryotic counterparts53. There has been an intense effort in recent years to understand how LPS is recognized by the host immune system through pattern recognition receptors54, and how this immune response is altered under microgravity conditions55,56.\n\nThe finding that symbioticV. fischerisheds more LPS under LSMMG conditions closely parallels previous studies that reported that microgravity analogs increases endotoxin load derived from the intestinal microbiota in rodents55,56. For example, in previous studies using the hindlimb unloading rodent model, a well established method to simulate musculoskeletal disuse observed in spaceflight57,58, results indicated that both LPS and the associated host derived lipopolysaccharide binding protein were elevated in rodent serum under hindlimb unloading56. Levels of circulating LPS were further increased with concurrent exposure to proton or gamma radiation, another environmental hazard of spaceflight55. Although the increased levels in the serum were thought to be the result of breakdown of the gut epithelial barrier during hindlimb unloading, the root cause of the overall increased levels of LPS shedding by the microbiota into the host serum was not assessed55,56.\n\nInterestingly, the results observed inV. fischeridiffer from other host associated taxa, such asSalmonella entericaserovar Typhimurium17. In previous studies, HARV cultivatedSalmonellaexhibited significantly diminished levels of LPS O antigen in LSMMG lysates, accompanied by a down regulation of therfbP,rfbM, andrfbIgenes involved in O antigen biosynthesis and ligation17. However,V. fischerilacks homologs to these O antigen synthesis genes59. InV. fischerithe O antigen is comprised of a single pentasaccharide comprised of a two yersiniose, one 8 epi legionaminic acid, and two n acetyl L fucosamine residues60. The two quantitative techniques used in this study, LAL and Purpald assays do not directly measure the O antigen so the differences between the two studies could reflect the methods used to quantify the LPS molecule as well as the different architectures of the LPS molecules. Alternatively, the differences in LPS release between the taxa under LSMMG conditions may simply reflect the fact thatSalmonelladoes not have sheathed flagella, whereasV. fischerihas a membranous sheath that requires more torque to rotate, thereby releasing more LPS61,62.\n\nIn this study, the increased shedding of LPS from the bacteriumV. fischeriunder LSMMG conditions coincided with the exponential growth of the cultures (Fig.2). In many taxa, includingV. fischeri, higher cell densities and growth rates are observed under modeled microgravity conditions (Supplementary Fig.1a, e)63,64. It has been proposed that the quiescent environment of LSMMG and continuous reorientation of the cell are altering the extracellular mass transfer of nutrients and waste, thereby impacting the cell's growth rate37,65. AlthoughV. fischeriis motile and there could be some mixing and disruption to the low shear environment,V. fischerimay be accustomed to microgravity like conditions as the symbionts regularly encounter low shear environments when interfacing with the epithelial brush border of the host squid light organ tissues. Therefore, the observed increased growth rate may simply reflect the natural growth response for these symbiotic bacteria under low shear stress environments.\n\nThe increase in LPS shedding under modeled microgravity conditions was also correlated to increases in the production of OMVs. The release of OMVs is an important mechanism by which bacteria interact with their environment66. OMVs derived from Gram negative bacteria are produced in all stages of growth, and are frequently enriched with a range of bioreactive molecules, including LPS, outer membrane proteins, and peptidoglycan derivatives46,67,68. These discrete, enclosed structures are known mediators of host microbe communication in both pathogenic and mutualistic associations69. In the squid vibrio symbiosis,V. fischeriOMVs have previously been shown to induce hemocyte trafficking and apoptosis in the host symbiotic light organ, and are important mediators of bacteria induced development in the host animal43,68. Both exogenous LPS and symbiont derived OMVs can induce significant apoptosis in the light organ of uncolonized, aposymbiotic hatchlings, even at low concentrations (Supplementary Fig.4). Thus, even small fluctuations in the amount of OMVs released in LSMMG could feasibly shift the timeline of symbiotic development.\n\nThe observed increase in the release of LPS containing OMVs during LSMMG conditions compared to gravity controls may suggest that the cells experience increased physiological stress in the modeled microgravity conditions, in particular, during exponential growth. Environmental stresses, such as temperature and osmotic stresses, can increase vesiculation in numerous Gram negative bacteria70. The hypervesiculation of OMVs has been shown to relieve the cell envelope from waste products and the build up of damaged, or misfolded, proteins, which accumulate during stress and normal growth70,71. Interestingly, the increased in OMV production under modeled microgravity conditions may also provide a possible mechanism for the increase resistance to environmental stresses and antibiotics observed in some microbes grown under both natural and microgravity conditions37,72,73. The ability of OMVs to quickly remove toxic material as well as absorb and bind antimicrobial agents may also serve as an important survival mechanism for microbes under stressful conditions, such as spaceflight.\n\nOne of the major mechanisms by whichV. fischerireleases the OMVs is through flagellar rotation36. Certain members of the genusVibrio, along with several other microbiome associated taxa, such asHelicobacter,Brucella, andCampylobacter, produce flagella covered with a membrane derived sheath74 79. These sheathed flagella have long been postulated to be a mechanism of communication between microbes and host tissues43,69,80. During rotation of the flagella, OMVs can then be released from both the tip and shaft of the flagella81,82. Mutants defective in flagella production, or in the rotation of the flagella, shed significantly fewer OMVs in comparison to wild type strains36. This result is consistent with theV. fischeristrains grown in the HARV reactors, suggesting flagellar rotation is likely the primary, but not the only, mechanism by which OMVs are being released in both LSMMG and gravity conditions (Fig.4). Interestingly, previous work found that flagella driven increases in OMV release corresponded to smaller OMV size, whereas our results found that LSMMG associated increases in OMV release corresponded with larger OMV sizes36. This result suggests that LSMMG presents a novel stress that stimulates a unique nonmotility  associated mechanism for OMV production changes inV. fischeri. In this vein, LSMMG stimulates increased production of OMVs across a range of bacteria with distinct lifestyles. Hypervesiculation has been reported in gentamycin challenged spaceflight cultures ofE. coli, a bacterium with unsheathed flagella, which unlike sheathed flagella, do not mediate LPS release40.\n\nOur findings indicate the increased release of OMVs under modeled microgravity conditions may reflect changes in membrane integrity. Bacteria have previously been found to have altered cells membranes in both spaceflight and modeled microgravity conditions. For example, irregularities in cell volume, envelope integrity, and membrane polarization have been reported forE. coliandStaphylococcus aureuscultured in both natural and modeled microgravity conditions63,83. The increased susceptibility ofV. fischeristrains to membrane disruption agents (Figs.5 7; Supplementary Figs.5 6) further support the hypothesis that the cell membrane ofV. fischeriis weakened by exposure to modeled microgravity conditions. In addition, previous analysis of the transcriptome ofV. fischericells showed no differential expression of genes associated with LPS production during either exponential or stationary phase when grown under LSMMG27. Therefore, the results suggest that increases in the amount of LPS shed byV. fischerioccur primarily through mechanical means, and not through changes in LPS biosynthesis. Additional research is needed, however, to explore whether increased OMV shedding in LSMMG causes, or is caused by, LSMMG related changes in cell membrane integrity.\n\nTogether, these results show that symbiotic microbes display significant physiological changes under modeled microgravity conditions, leading to a change in release of MAMPs known to affect host biology, which may have implications on host microbe interactions. For example, in symbiotic bobtail squid exposed to modeled microgravity conditions the onset and peak ofV. fischeri induced apoptosis of the light organ's superficial epithelium occurs significantly earlier than under gravity controls, which could be explained by increased OMV shedding21. Interestingly though, under LSMMG conditions there is also a delay in the trafficking of host immune cells within the superficial epithelium21, which is also typically triggered by MAMPs and is dependent on the presence of the outer membrane protein OmpU in the OMVs43,68. This dissociated response in the host animal under LSMMG suggests microgravity may alter the content of the OMVs, or that the host may be responding differently to these bacterial derived signals under microgravity, despite the lack of differences observed in the extent of LPS induced cell death between LSMMG and gravity controls (Supplementary Fig.4).\n\nAs many of the mechanisms thatV. fischeriuse to communicate with its host are shared amongst both pathogenic and beneficial microbes alike, our work provides important insight into how microgravity like conditions may alter host microbe relationships at the physiological level in general. Maintaining homeostasis of the microbiome during spaceflight is critical for the long term host health, and these findings help build a critical framework to begin to explore the specific interactions and responses that occur between animals and their associated microbes.",
