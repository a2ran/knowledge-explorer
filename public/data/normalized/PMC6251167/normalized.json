    "abstract": "The antimicrobial resistance (AMR) phenotypic properties, multiple drug resistance (MDR) gene profiles, and genes related to potential virulence and pathogenic properties of fiveEnterobacter bugandensisstrains isolated from the International Space Station (ISS) were carried out and compared with genomes of three clinical strains. Whole genome sequences of ISS strains were characterized using the hybrid de novo assembly of Nanopore and Illumina reads. In addition to traditional microbial taxonomic approaches, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis was performed to classify the phylogenetic lineage. Agar diffusion discs assay was performed to test antibiotics susceptibility. The draft genomes after assembly and scaffolding were annotated with the Rapid Annotations using Subsystems Technology and RNAmmer servers for downstream analysis.\n\nMolecular phylogeny and whole genome analysis of the ISS strains with all publicly availableEnterobactergenomes revealed that ISS strains wereE. bugandensisand similar to the type strain EB 247Tand two clinical isolates (153_ECLO and MBRL 1077). Comparative genomic analyses of all eightE. bungandensisstrains showed, a total of 4733 genes were associated with carbohydrate metabolism (635 genes), amino acid and derivatives (496 genes), protein metabolism (291 genes), cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups, pigments (275 genes), membrane transport (247 genes), and RNA metabolism (239 genes). In addition, 112 genes identified in the ISS strains were involved in virulence, disease, and defense. Genes associated with resistance to antibiotics and toxic compounds, including the MDR tripartite system were also identified in the ISS strains. A multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) locus or MAR operon encoding MarA, MarB, MarC, and MarR, which regulate more than 60 genes, including upregulation of drug efflux systems that have been reported inEscherichia coliK12, was also observed in the ISS strains.\n\nGiven the MDR results for these ISSEnterobactergenomes and increased chance of pathogenicity (PathogenFinder algorithm with >79% probability), these species pose important health considerations for future missions. Thorough genomic characterization of the strains isolated from ISS can help to understand the pathogenic potential, and inform future missions, but analyzing them in in vivo systems is required to discern the influence of microgravity on their pathogenicity.\n\nThe online version of this article (10.1186/s12866 018 1325 2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\nKeywords:Enterobacter, International Space Station, Phylogenomic analyses",
    "methods": "Sample collection from ISS environmental surfaces, processing, cultivation of bacteria were already reported [9]. When 105 bacterial strains isolated from various ISS locations were analyzed for their phylogenetic affiliations, five isolates were identified asEnterobacter bugandensis. The fiveEnterobacterisolates characterized during this study were isolated from two different locations of the ISS flight in March 2015. Four isolates were isolated from the waste and hygiene compartment (WHC), and one strain from the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED) foot platform of ISS.\n\nThe isolates were biochemically identified using Vitek2 Compact gram negative (GN) cards (bioMerieux, Inc., Hazelwood, MO) [16] and BioLog (Hayward, CA) carbon substrate utilization profile characterization [17]. Sample preparation for MALDI TOF MS protein analysis was carried out as previously established [18]. MALDI TOF mass spectra were obtained from an Ultraflex III instrument (Bruker Daltonik, Billerica, MA) operated in linear positive mode under Flex Control 3.1 software. Mass spectra were processed using Flex Analysis (version 3.1; Bruker Daltonik) and BioTyper software (version 3.1; Bruker Daltonik).\n\nGenomic DNA extraction was performed as described previously [9]. WGS was performed on the Oxford Nanopore MinION (Oxford, United Kingdom) and Illumina MiSeq sequencing platform (San Diego, CA). A hybrid approach was utilized for genome assembly using reads from both platforms. Nanopore reads were processed using Poretools [19] toolkit for the purposes of quality control and downstream analysis. Error corrected Nanopore and MiSeq reads were assembled using SPAdes [20]. Scaffolding of the assembled contigs was done using SSpace [21] and gap filling was executed using GapFiller [22]. The draft genomes after assembly and scaffolding were annotated with the help of the Rapid Annotations using Subsystems Technology (RAST) [23] and RNAmmer servers [24] for downstream analysis [25,26] ISS strains assembly characteristics are given in Additionalfile1: Table S1. The 16S rRNA,gyrB,andrpoBgene sequences were retrieved from the WGS and analyzed for their phylogenetic affiliations. The neighbor joining phylogenetic analysis was performed using the MEGA7 software package [27]. MLST analysis was carried out as described previously [28]. The MLST scheme employed here uses seven house keeping genes:dnaA(DNA replication initiator),fusA(codes Elongation factor G),gyrB(DNA replication and repair),leuS(Leucine tRNA ligase),pyrG(CTP synthase),rplB(50S ribosomal protein), andrpoB(beta subunit of bacterial RNA polymerase) [29]. The retrieved sequences were compared with the sequence types deposited atE. cloacaeMLST database [30], concatenated according to the MLST scheme. The genes were analyzed independently, or as a single concatenate using neighbor joining algorithms.\n\nThe SNP based phylogenetic tree was generated using CSIPhylogeny [28] version 1.4. Using genome sequences of multiple isolates CSIPhylogeny calls SNP, filters the SNPs, performs site validation, and infers a phylogeny based on the concatenated alignment of high quality SNPs. The analysis includedEnterobacterreference whole genome sequences which were downloaded from the NCBI GenBank database. This genome wide SNP analysis allows for higher resolution phylogenetic analysis compared to other methods, which is necessary for comparing highly similar genomes. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. A total of 3832 positions in the dataset were used to confer the final tree.\n\nHybrid genome assembly (ONT and Illumina data) of strain IF3SW P2 was nominated as reference genome of the 5 strains sequenced. The IF3SW P2 genome was used to realign the Illumina MiSeq reads with reads of other 4 strains using bwa mem (http://bio bwa.sourceforge.net/). Postprocessing of the BAM files was performed using SAMtools [31] and picard (https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard). GATK HaplotypeCaller (https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/) was used for SNP and indels identification.\n\nPairwise average nucleotide index (ANI) was calculated using the algorithm from Goris et al. 2007 [32] and GC content was determined using EzTaxon e [33]. Digital DNA DNA hybridization (dDDH) was performed using the Genome to Genome Distance Calculator 2.0 (GGDC 2.0) [34]. Briefly, the genome sequences in FASTA format were submitted to GGDC 2.0 along with the sequences in FASTA format for theEnterobacterreference genome that were available:E. aerogenesKCTC 2190,E. asburiaeATCC 35953,E. bugandensisEB 247T,E. cancerogenusATCC 35316,E. cloacaeATCC 13047,E. hormaecheiATCC 49162,E. kobeiDSM 13645,E. lignolyticusSCF1,E. ludwigiiEN119,E. massiliensisJC163,E. moriLMG25706,E. muelleriJM 458T,E. xiangfangensisLMG 27195, andE. soliATCC BAA 2102.The results were obtained by comparing query genomes (ISS isolates) with each of the reference genomes to calculate dDDH and intergenomic distances. Global comparison of ISS isolates with other species was done using local BLAST [35]. Genome sequence assemblies were aligned using BLASTN and the diagrammatic view was created using BLAST Ring Image Generator (BRIG) software [36].\n\nThe WGS data submitted to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank and NASA GenLab databases were downloaded and characterized during this study. The complete genome sequences of all ISS strains were deposited in NCBI under Bioproject PRJNA319366 as well as at the NASA GeneLab system (GLDS 67;https://genelab data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS 67/#). The GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession numbers for the 16S rRNA gene sequence of isolated strains are: IF2SW B1 (KY218809), IF2SW B5 (KY218813), IF2SW P2T(KY218815), IF2SW P3 (KY218816), and IF3SW P2 (KY218819).",
    "results": "The ISS strains showed aerobic, motile, rod shape, Gram stain negative characteristics; colonies were pale yellow in color, formed within 24 36h at 35 degreesC on R2A, TSA, and blood agar. Growth was observed at 1 8% NaCl and in pH range 5 7. The Vitek and BioLog systems as well as MALDI TOF profiles identified the ISS strains asE. ludwigii.The MALDI TOF profile scores for the tested strains were 2.16(E. ludwigii) and 2.10 (E. asburiae).In general, no noticeable phenotypic differences were observed among theEnterobacterspecies tested includingE. bugandensisEB 247T, whose genome is closer to ISS strains. As reported earlier, all these five ISSEnterobacterisolates were resistant to cefazolin, cefoxitin, oxacillin, penicillin and rifampin, while for ciprofloxacin and erythromycin, strains were either resistant or intermediate resistant. For gentamycin and tobramycin some strains were resistant, some intermediate resistant, and some susceptible [9].\n\nThe 16S rRNA gene sequencing of all five isolates placed them within theEnterobactergroup and showed maximum similarity (99.6%) withE. bugandensisEB 247T,E. cancerogenusLMG 2693,E. ludwigiiEN 119, andE. moriR18 2 (99 to 100%). Since 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis is insufficient to differentiateEnterobacterspecies, polygenic and whole genome based analyses were further attempted. All ISS strains were phylogenetically characterized by thegyrBlocus (~1.9kb) and showed that the ISS isolates form a close group withE. bugandensisEB 247Tand 153_ECLO strains (>99%) while MBRL 1077 isolate was exhibiting 97% similarity with high bootstrap value.\n\nThe genomic contigs of the ISS isolates were searched for gene sequences ofdnaA, fusA, gyrB. leuS, pyrG, rplB, and rpoB, which are standardized for the use of MLST analysis and reported forE. cloacaespecies [29]. The good congruence between the single gene reconstructions and the concatenate reinforced the stability of the genealogy were observed. The reconstruction was based on the RAxML algorithm [37] and the resulting MLST tree (Fig.1) shows that the ISS isolates are phlylogenetically related toE. bugandensisclinical strains (EB 247, strain 153_ECLO, and isolate MBRL 1077).\n\nMultiple locus sequence types (MLST) analysis of ISS strains and related species of theEnterobacter. The obtained genomic contigs of the ISS isolates (in bold) were searched for gene sequences ofdnaA,fusA, gyrB,leuS,pyrG,rplB, andrpoB, which are standardized for the use in MLST analysis and reported forE. cloacaespecies [29]. The retrieved sequences were compared with the sequence types deposited at theEnterobacterMLST database, concatenated according to the MLST scheme. The reconstruction was based on the RAxML algorithm [4], and the bootstrap values were calculated using 1000 replicates. The bar indicates 2% sequence divergence\n\nEven though MLST analysis was clearly able to genomically resolve the ISS isolates to species level and distinguish them from other members of the genusEnterobacter, whole genome SNP analysis, SNP tree analysis excluding plasmid sequences, was carried out to validate these results. The snpTree does not ignore any nucleotide positions and is able to consider 100% of the chromosomal genome. All the available WGS of theEnterobactergenus reference genomes from GenBank were used for SNP analysis with snpTree. Of the 22 total nucleotide sequences; 58,121 positions were found in all analyzed genomes and 3832 positions in the dataset were used to confer the final tree (Fig.2). The snpTree analyses confirmed and gave a strong validation to the MLST/gyrBdata, confirming that all ISS isolates areE. bugandensisbut strain MBRL 1077 grouped differently from the members of theE. bugandensisgroup.\n\nSingle nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) based phylogenetic tree, showing the relationship between the ISS isolates (in bold) and members of theEnterobactergenus. The tree was generated using CSI Phylogeny [28] version 1.4\n\nSNP identification within ISS strains was carried out using GATK HaplotypeCaller. Filtered SNP calls and indels (after removal of false positives) are given in the Additional file1: Table S1. Post filtration analyses showed that there were 9, 12, 15, 13, and 0 SNPs seen in IF2SWB1, IF2SWB5, IF2SWP2, IS2WP3 and IS3SWP2, respectively. Further 6, 0, 4, 6, and 0 indels were seen in IF2SWB1, IF2SWB5, IF2SWP2, IS2WP3 and IS3SWP2, respectively (Additional file1: Table S1). A maximum of 15 SNPs was observed among ISS isolates, probably being clonal in origin, with a very recent common ancestor. However, it should be noted that 4 strains were isolated from location #2 (space toilet) and one strain from the exercise platform (ARED).\n\nThe ANI values for the ISS strains were maximum againstE. bugandensisEB 247, 153_ECLO, and MBRL 1077 strains (>95%) as were those of MLST analyses, and the ANI values of rest of theEnterobactergenomes tested were<91% (Table1). The digital DNA DNA hybridization (dDDH) results of the ISS strain showed high similarity withE. bugandensisEB 247 (89.2%), 153_ECLO (89.4%), and MBRL 1077 (64%) strains whereas dDDH value was <44.6% to all the other availableEnterobacterreference genomes (Table1). Based on various molecular analyses attempted during this study all five ISSEnterobacterstrains were phenotypically and genotypically identified asE. bugandensis.\n\nDigital DDH and ANI values of ISS strains and comparison with variousEnterobacterspecies\n\ndDDHdigital DNA DNA hybridization,ANIAverage Nucleotide Identity,WHCWaste and Hygiene Compartment,AREDAdvanced resistive exercise device (ARED) foot platform\n\nA detailed genome analysis of all five ISS strains and 3 clinical isolates were carried out to understand its genetic makeup. A total of 4733 genes were classified as carbohydrate metabolism (635 genes), amino acid and derivatives (496 genes), protein metabolism (291 genes), cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups, pigments (275 genes), membrane transport (247 genes), and RNA metabolism (239 genes) (Fig.3). To test antimicrobial resistance at genomic level, the ISS strains were further compared with nosocomial isolates (1291 genomes) having more than 95% ANI identity with the ISS strains, which taxonomically identified them as same species. Genomes of the clinical strains ofE. bugandensis247, 153_ECLO, and MBRL 1077, whose ANI values were>95%, were used for the genetic comparison to further broaden the picture.\n\nMetabolic functional profiles and subsystem categories distribution of strain IF3SW P2. 4733 genes were identified that dominated by carbohydrate metabolism followed by amino acid and derivatives\n\nFeatures playing a broad role and implemented by the same domain such as Spectinomycin 9 O adenylyltransferase and Streptomycin 3 O adenylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.47) were only present inE. bugandensis247 due to the probable lack of selective pressure that might have been encountered by the ISS isolates (Table2). The predicted arsenic resistance (arsenic resistance protein, ArsH) noticed inE. bugandensis247 but not in other strains should be phenotypically tested to confirm the resistance properties conferred in strainE. bugandensis247 and cross checked with the ISS strains for their inability to degrade arsenic. Trace metals detected in ISS potable water samples, but typically below potability requirements, included arsenic, barium, chromium, copper, iron, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, lead, selenium, and zinc. No mercury or cadmium was detected and the arsenic levels varied from nondetectable in water samples to a maximum of 3.8ug/L [38].\n\nComparative analyses of antimicrobial gene profiles ofE. bungandensisisolated from ISS and clinical sources\n\nA visualization program was reported to be invaluable [36] in determining the genotypic differences between closely related prokaryotes. Visualizing a prokaryote genome as a circular image has become a powerful means of displaying informative comparisons of one genome to a number of others. Using BRIG, a global visual comparison of ISS isolates with otherEnterobacterWGS from the GenBank Microbial Genomes Resource was carried out. The resulting output of the BRIG analysis [36], a visualization image, showed draft genome assembly information, read coverage, assembly breakpoints, and collapsed repeats. The mapping of unassembled sequencing reads of the ISS genomes against fully annotatedE. cloacaecentral reference sequences is depicted in Fig.4.\n\nGlobal comparison of ISSE. bugandensiswith otherEnterobacterWGS from NCBI Microbial Genomes Resource was done using BRIG. Genome sequence assemblies were aligned using BLASTN and the diagrammatic view was created using BRIG software. The innermost ring indicates the genomic position of the reference genome (E. bugandensis 247T), next ring indicates GC content, and the third ring indicates GC skewness. The remaining 21 rings indicate the presence or absence of BLASTN hits at that position. Each ring represents WGS of singleEnterobacterspecies, each shown in different color. Positions covered by BLASTN alignments are indicated in solid colors and gaps (white spaces) represent genomic regions not covered by BLASTN alignments. Order of genome from inner ring to outer is as follow:E. aerogenesKCTC 2190,E. asburiaeATCC 35953T,E. bugandensisEB 247T,E. cancerogenusATCC 35316,E. bugandensis153_ECLO,E. cloacaeATCC 13047T,E. bugandensisMBRL1077,E. hormaecheiATCC 49162T,E. kobeiDSM 13645T,E. lignolyticusSCF1,E. ludwigiiEN 119T,E. massiliensisJC163T,E. moriLMG 25706T,E. muelleriJM 458T,Enterobacter soliATCC BAA 2102T,Enterobacter xiangfangensisLMG 27195T,E. bugandensisIF2SW B1,E. bugandensisIF2SW B5,E. bugandensisIF2SW P2,E. bugandensisIF2SW P3,E. bugandensisIF3SW P2,Xenorhabdus nematophilaATCC 19061T",
    "discussion": "In summary, a comparative phenotypic and genotypic analyses of ISS isolates identified asE. bugandensiswere carried out.Additional genomic analyses revealed a close genetic relatedness between ISS isolates and nosocomial earth isolates. MLST and whole genome SNP tree placed ISS and nosocomial isolates to a separate clade when phylogenetically aligned with other member of genusEnterobacter. A detailed functional and antimicrobial resistance analysis reveals that the ISS isolates have a 79% probability of being a human pathogen and share similar antimicrobial resistance pattern withE. bugandensisEB 247,MBRL 1077 and 153_ECLO strains, making them relevant for future missions and crew health considerations.\n\nA total of 112 identified genes of the ISS strains were involved in virulence, disease, and defense. Genes associated with resistance to antibiotics and toxic compounds, including the multidrug resistance tripartite system (also known as 3 protein systems) as shown in a polychlorinated biphenyl degrader,Burkholderia xenovoransLB400 [39], was noticed in the ISS strain. This protein forms the basic structure and plays a crucial role in, the functioning of an efflux pump rendering a microbe drug resistant [40,41]. A multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) locus or MAR operon was observed in ISS strains, which codes for protein MarA, MarB, MarC, and MarR, and regulate more than 60 genes, including upregulation of drug efflux systems that have been reported inEscherichia coliK12 [42 44]. Aminoglycoside adenylyltransferases, whose role is spectinomycin 9 O adenylyltransferases, which confers microbial resistance to the aminoglycosides inSalmonella enterica,was also seen in ISS strains [45]. Similarly, resistance to fluoroquinolones due to a mutation ingyrAgene inS. enterica[46], and fosfomycin resistance due to the presence of FosA protein coding gene, which catalyzes the addition of glutathione to C1 of the oxirane inSerratia marcescens[47], were observed in ISS strains. Multiple copies of multi drug resistance (MDR) genes highly homologous toS. marcescens, a pathogen, were identified in the ISSEnterobactergenomes, which gives an indication that these strains may be a potential human pathogen. When tested with PathogenFinder [48] algorithm, strain IF2SW P2Thad >77% probability to be a human pathogen. When compared withE. cloacaeATCC 13047, which is a well described human pathogen [49], all five ISS strains showed a>79% probability score.\n\nAstronauts have been taking beta lactam based medical drugs for approximately two decades, and  lactamase (superfamily I [metal dependent hydrolases] and E.C.3.5.2.6) was present in all strains under study, while penicillin binding proteins (PPB4B) were only present in MBRL 1077. Fluoroquinolone resistance due to gyrase and topoisomerase mutation was present in all the strains. Metal dependent hydrolases, cation efflux system protein CusA, cobalt zinc cadmium resistance protein, cobalt zinc cadmium resistance protein CzcA, DNA binding heavy metal response regulator, Co/Zn/Cd efflux system membrane fusion protein, zinc transporter ZitB were found in both ISS isolate and nosocomial organism understudy. These genes principally help in detoxification of periplasm by exporting toxic metal cation outside the cell. Determinants of the metal resistance are usually located on the plasmid and readily acquired from the environment and also complement antibiotic resistance [50,51]. The plasmid encoded putative transcriptional regulators containing the CopG/Arc/MetJ DNA binding domain and a metal binding domain were present in the ISS strains (Additionalfile2: Table S2). Further studies are required for phenotypic characterization to confirm this trait. Presence of active beta lactamase gene, efflux pump, and RND (resistance, nodulation and cell division protein family) protein family renders broad spectrum resistance to ISS isolates from drugs and natural inhibitors.\n\nWe have recently observed that competency of bacteria to acquire foreign genetic material increases in microgravity (in preparation) and similar mechanism for metal resistance of ISS strain was also predicted. Antimicrobial and metal resistance is also conferred by RND genes [52], which were present in all the strains under study. Genomic analysis reveals the presence of genes associated with MDR efflux pump, belonging to RND, which are reported to be the major contributors of resistance to antibiotic and other toxic compounds to the bacteria [41]. RND efflux system, inner membrane transporter CmeB, membrane fusion protein CmeA, outer membrane lipoprotein CmeC, outer membrane lipoprotein NodT family were found in all strains. These become important for the future space studies, as MDR has been reported to play role in the physiological function and confer resistance to the substances like bile, hormone and host defense molecule [53], which can make bacteria a dominant persistor and lead to pathogenicity in humans.",
    "conclusion": "The genomic characterizations showed that the ISSEnterobacterstrains might potentially exhibit pathogenicity to human. However, the pathogenicity of the ISS strains compared to clinical strains isolated from patients should be explored in vivo experiments before making any assumption about whether these potential AMR gene markers are due to spaceflight changes or not. Moreover, the transit time and route for the organisms from the ISS may have some small impact on the response or physiological traits of the bacteria. WGS is still an important tool to monitor transmission routes of opportunistic pathogen bacteria [25,26]. To avoid this, future missions could utilize Nanopore sequencing directly in microgravity as well as additional function and taxonomic classification methods [26,54], and then leverage the above detailed analytic steps to gauge relevance for crew health and safety."
