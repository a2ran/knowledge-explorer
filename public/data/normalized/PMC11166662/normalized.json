    "abstract": "The SpaceX Inspiration4 mission provided a unique opportunity to study the impact of spaceflight on the human body. Biospecimen samples were collected from four crew members longitudinally before (Launch: L 92, L 44, L 3 days), during (Flight Day: FD1, FD2, FD3), and after (Return: R+1, R+45, R+82, R+194 days) spaceflight, spanning a total of 289 days across 2021 2022. The collection process included venous whole blood, capillary dried blood spot cards, saliva, urine, stool, body swabs, capsule swabs, SpaceX Dragon capsule HEPA filter, and skin biopsies. Venous whole blood was further processed to obtain aliquots of serum, plasma, extracellular vesicles and particles, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In total, 2,911 sample aliquots were shipped to our central lab at Weill Cornell Medicine for downstream assays and biobanking. This paper provides an overview of the extensive biospecimen collection and highlights their processing procedures and long term biobanking techniques, facilitating future molecular tests and evaluations.As such, this study details a robust framework for obtaining and preserving high quality human, microbial, and environmental samples for aerospace medicine in the Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA) initiative, which can aid future human spaceflight and space biology experiments.\n\nSubject terms:Molecular biology, Genetics, Biomarkers",
    "methods": "Venipuncture was performed on each subject using a BD Vacutainer Safety Lok blood collection set (BD Biosciences, #367281) and a Vacutainer one use holder (BD Biosciences, 364815). The puncture site was located near the cubital fossa and was sterilized with a BZK antiseptic towelette (Dynarex, Reorder No. 1303). Blood was collected into 1 serum separator tube (SST, BD Biosciences: #367987, Lot: #1158449, #1034773), 2 cell processing tubes (CPT, BD Biosciences: #362753, Lot: #1133477, #1012161), 1 blood RNA tube (bRNA, PAXgene: #762165, Lot: #1021333), 1 cell free DNA BCT (cfDNA BCT, Streck: #230470, Lot: #11530331), and 4 K2 EDTA blood collection tubes (BD Biosciences, #367844, Lot: #0345756) per crew member per time point. For samples collected in Hawthorne, blood was drawn at SpaceX headquarters, then immediately transported to USC for processing. Samples collected at Cape Canaveral were processed on site.\n\nFor processing, serum separator tubes (SST) were centrifuged at 1300xgfor 10minutes. 500uL aliquots of serum were aliquoted into 1mL Matrix 2D Screw Tubes (ThermoFisher, 3741 WP1D BR) and stored at  80 degreesC. SST tubes were recapped and stored at  20 degreesC to preserve the red blood cell pellet.\n\nCell processing tubes were centrifuged at 1800xg for 30minutes. Plasma was aliquoted into 1mL Matrix 2D Screw Tubes and stored at  80 degreesC. 5mL of 2% FBS (ThermoFisher, #26140079) in PBS (ThermoFisher, #10010023) was added to the CPT tube to resuspend PBMCs. PBMC suspension was transferred to a clean 15mL conical tube. The total volume was brought to 15mL with 2% FBS in PBS. The tube was centrifuged for 15minutes at 300xg. Supernatant was discarded. PBMCs were resuspended 6mL of 10% DMSO (Millipore Sigma, #D4540 500mL) in FBS. 1mL of PBMCs were moved to 6 cryogenic vials (Corning, #8672). Cryovials were placed in a Mr. FrostyTM(ThermoFisher, #5100 0001) and stored at  80 degreesC. CPTs were recapped and stored at  20 degreesC to preserve the red blood cell pellet. There was one outlier to this sample collection, the R+194 timepoint, where CPT sodium citrate tubes were used (BD Biosciences, Cat no. 362760).\n\ncfDNA BCTs were centrifuged at 300xg for 20minutes. Plasma was transferred to a 15mL conical tube. Plasma was centrifuged 5000xg for 10minutes. 500uL aliquots of plasma were aliquoted into 1mL Matrix 2D Screw Tubes and stored at  80 degreesC. cfDNA BCTs were recapped and stored at  20 degreesC to preserve the red blood cell pellet.\n\nPAXgene blood RNA tubes were processed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, tubes were left upright for a minimum of 2hours before freezing at  20 degreesC. For RNA extraction, tubes were thawed and processed with the PAXgene blood RNA kit (Qiagen, #762164).\n\nOne 4mL K2 EDTA tube was shipped on ice overnight to WCM for processing. Blood was centrifuged at 500xgfor 10minutes, then plasma was transferred to a new tube and centrifuged at 3000 x g for 20minutes, and the supernatant was collected and stored at  80 degreesC for EVP isolation. Plasma volumes ranged between 0.6   1.7ml. Plasma was later thawed for downstream processing, when concentrations were measured. Plasma samples were thawed on ice, and EVPs were isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation (Hoshino et al., 2020). Samples were centrifuged at 12,000xgfor 20minutes to remove microvesicles, then EVPs were collected by ultracentrifugation in a Beckman Coulter Optima XE or XPE ultracentrifuge at 100,000xgfor 70minutes. EVPs were then washed in PBS and pelleted again by ultracentrifugation at 100,000xgfor 70minutes. The final EVP pellet was resuspended in PBS.\n\nCrew members warmed their hands and massaged their finger towards the fingertip to enrich blood flow toward the puncture site. The puncture site was sterilized using a BZK antiseptic towelette (Dynarex, Reorder No. 1303). Skin was punctured using a contact activated lancet (BD Biosciences, #366593) or a 21 gauge needle (BD Biosciences, #305167), depending on crew member preference. Capillary blood was collected onto the Whatman 903 Protein Saver DBS cards (Cytiva, #10534612). Blood was transferred by touching only the blood droplet to the surface of the DBS card. DBS cards were stored at room temperature with a desiccant pack (Cytiva, #10548239).\n\nTo collect crude saliva, crew members uncapped and spit into a sterile, PCR clean, 5mL screw cap tube (Eppendorf, 30122330). Crew spit repeatedly until at least 1mL was collected. Saliva was transported to a sterile flow hood and separated into 500uL aliquots. Aliquots were frozen at  80 degreesC. To collect preserved saliva, crew members used the OMNIgene ORAL kit (OME 505). Crew members spit into the kit's tube until they reached the fill line. The tube was re capped, which released the preservative liquid. Tubes were inverted to mix the saliva and preservative before being placed at  20 degreesC for storage. After all timepoints were collected, DNA, RNA, and protein were extracted using the AllPrep DNA/RNA/Protein kit (Qiagen, #47054). Sample concentrations were measured with Qubit high sensitivity dsDNA and RNA platform. Proteins were quantified with the Pierce Rapid Gold BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific, #A53225) on Promega GloMax Plate Reader.\n\nCrew members urinated into sterile specimen containers (Thermo Scientific, #13 711 56). The container was stored at 4C until it was prepared for long term storage. To prepare urine samples for long term storage, urine was aliquoted into 1mL, 15mL, and 50mL tubes. Half of the urine was immediately placed at  80 degreesC. The other half had urine conditioning buffer (Zymo, #D3061 1 140) added to the sample before placing in the  80 degreesC freezer.\n\nCrew members isolated a stool sample using a paper toilet accessory (DNA Genotek, OM AC1). Stool was transferred into and OMNIgeneGUT tube (DNAgenotek, OMR 200) and an OMNImetGUT tube (DNA Genotek, ME 200). Tubes were placed at  80 degreesC for long term storage. For nucleic acid extraction, 200uL of each tube was allocated for DNA extraction with the QIAGEN PowerFecal Pro kit and 200uL was allocated to RNA extraction with the QIAGEN PowerViral kit. The remaining sample was split into 500uL aliquots and re stored at  80 degreesC.\n\nCrew members put on gloves and remove a sterile DNA/RNA swab (Isohelix, SK 4S) from its packaging. For collection of the postauricular, axillary vault, volar forearm, occiput, umbilicus, gluteal crease, glabella, toe web space, and capsule environment regions, swabs were dipped in nuclease free water (this step was skipped for oral and nasal swabs) for ground collections. For in flight collections, HFactor hydrogen infused water was used in place of nuclease free water. Each body location was swabbed for 30seconds, using both sides of the swab. Swabs were then placed in 1mL Matrix 2D Screw Tubes containing 400uL of DNA/RNA Shield (Zymo). The tip of the swab was broken off so that only the swab tip was stored in the Matrix 2D Screw Tube. Tubes were stored at 4C.\n\nSkin biopsies were performed on the deltoid region of the arm. Each site was prepared by application of ChloraPrep and anesthesia was induced with administration of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine. A trephine punch was used to remove a 3  or 4 mm diameter piece of skin. The resected piece was cut into approximately1/3and2/3sections. The smaller piece was added to a formalin filled specimen jar. The larger piece was placed in a cryovial and stored at  80 degreesC. Surgical defects were closed with 1 or 2 5 0 or 4 0 nylon sutures.\n\nHEPA Filter was taken apart and sectioned under a chemical hood to avoid contamination. The filter contained two parts, an activated carbon component and a HEPA filter. The activated carbon component was discarded and the filter was sectioned using a sterile blade. Sections were placed in individual specimen containers and stored at  20 degreesC.\n\nAll subjects were consented and samples were collected and processed under the approval of the IRB at Weill Cornell Medicine, under Protocol 21 05023569.\n\nFigures1c,2c,3,5a,8were created with BioRender.com released under a 'Creative Commons Attribution NonCommercial NoDerivs 4.0 International license'.

    "results": "We formulated and executed a sampling plan that spans a wide range of biospecimen samples: venous blood, capillary dried blood spots (DBSs), saliva, urine, stool, skin swabs, skin biopsies, and environmental swabs (Fig.1a). The collection of various types of samples covered the scope of previous assays on astronaut samples (Supplementary Table1), but also enabled newer omics technologies, such as spatially resolved, single molecule, and single cell assays.\n\naList of biospecimen samples collected over the course of the study.bTimepoints for each biospecimen sample collection. \"L \" denotes the number of days prior to launch. \"R+\" denotes the number of days after return to Earth. \"FD\" denotes which day of the flight a sample was collected.cLocation of each collection timepoint.\n\nFor the I4 mission, sample collection spanned three time points pre launch (L 92, L 44, L 3 days), three time points during flight (Flight Day 1 (FD1), FD2, FD3), and four time points post return (R+1, R+45, R+82, R+194 days). Venous blood, urine, stool, and skin biopsies were collected during ground timepoints only, while capillary DBSs, saliva, and skin swabs were collected both on the ground and during flight (Fig.1b). Environmental swabs of the Dragon capsule were collected pre flight in the crew training capsule and during flight in the spacecraft launched from Cape Canaveral (Fig.1b).\n\nSamples were collected across a variety of locations based on the crew's training and travel schedule. L 92 and L 44 were collected in Hawthorne, CA at SpaceX Headquarters, L 3 and R+1 were collected at Cape Canaveral, FL at a facility near the launch site. FD1, FD2, and FD3 were collected inside the Dragon capsule while in orbit. R+45 was collected at the crew members' individual locations (which spanned the US States NY, NJ, TN, and WA), R+82 was collected at Weill Cornell Medicine, NY and R+194 was collected at Baylor College of Medicine, TX (Fig.1c). All samples from ground timepoints were processed within 16hours of collection. All samples from the flight were processed immediately after retrieval from the flight.\n\nSamples were stored at  80 degreesC at each site immediately after processing and aliquoting (processing steps are outlined below). All samples were shipped via FedEx using Overnight Shipping to Weill Cornell Medicine for storage in the Cornell Aerospace Medicine Biobank (CAMbank) within 1 week of collection on dry ice in styrofoam boxes and spent <2 days in transit. No samples were shipped on a Thursday or Friday to avoid weekend shipping delays. All samples arrived at Weill Cornell Medicine with dry ice still in the packaging and samples frozen. Samples were immediately transferred to  80 degreesC for long term storage and biobanking. Any exceptions to this process will be noted below. In total, we collected 2,911 sample aliquots, which were then processed in our central lab at Weill Cornell Medicine for downstream assays (Supplementary Table2). Some samples were processed immediately at field laboratory facilities (Supplementary Data Fig.1). DNA and RNA yields are also reported below from collection kits (saliva and stool) after arrival at WCM.\n\nBlood was collected using a combination of venipuncture tubes to collect venous blood and contact activated lancets to collect capillary blood from the fingertip. Each crew member provided blood samples, collected into one BD PAXgene blood RNA tube (bRNA), four BD Vacutainer K2 EDTA tubes, two BD Vacutainer cell preparation tubes (CPTs), one Streck cell free DNA tube (cfDNA BCT), one BD Vacutainer serum separator tube (SST), and one DBS card per time point. Tubes were transported from the collection site to the field laboratory at room temperature. From these tubes, whole blood, plasma, PBMCs, serum, and cell pellet samples were collected (Supplementary Table3). Sample yields are reported below. Samples were aliquoted for long term storage and biobanking (Supplementary Table4).\n\nbRNA tubes were collected in order to isolate total RNA using the PAXgene blood RNA kit (Fig.2a). Yield ranged from 3.04 to 14.04ug/tube of total RNA across all samples, and the RNA integrity number (RIN) ranged from 3.2 to 8.5 (mean: 6.95) (Fig.2b). RNA was stored at  80 degreesC after extraction. The collection of total RNA enables a variety of downstream RNA profiling methods. It will allow comparative studies to prior RNA sequencing performed on astronauts, particularly snoRNA & lncRNA biomarkers analyzed from Space Shuttle era blood25,26, mRNA & miRNA measured during the NASA Twin Study17,18, and whole blood RNA arrays from the ISS27,28. Additionally, RNA yields are more than sufficient to perform direct RNA sequencing using Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) platforms, which require 500ng of total RNA per library (Manufacturer's protocol, ONT kit SQK RNA002). This enables the study of RNA modification changes during spaceflight to create epitranscriptomic profiles for the first time in astronauts.\n\naOne 2.5mL bRNA tube was collected per crew member at each ground timepoint.bbRNA tube total RNA yields per sample (ug) and RINs.cFour K2 EDTA tubes were collected per member at each ground timepoint. One tube was used for a CBC, one tube was used to isolate EVPs, and two tubes were used for isolation of PBMCs.dPlasma and EVP yields from the \"[2] EVPS\" tube on Fig.2c.ePBMC yields per mL from the \"[3] PBMCs\" tubes on Fig.2c.\n\nFour K2 EDTA tubes were drawn at each timepoint from each crew member (Fig.2c). One K2 EDTA tube was submitted to Quest Diagnostics to perform a complete blood count (CBC, Quest Test Code: 6399). One tube was used to isolate extracellular vesicles and particles (EVPs) for proteomic quantification (Fig.3a). Total EVP quantities varied from 2.71 28.27 ug (Fig.2d). Two K2 EDTA tubes were used to isolate PBMCs for single cell sequencing (10X Chromium Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression and Chromium Single Cell Immune Profiling workflows). After collection, a Ficoll separation was performed to isolate PBMCs, which ranged from 340,000 975,000 cells per mL of blood (Fig.2e). One prior single cell gene expression experiment, NASA Twin study, was performed on astronauts, which found immune cell population specific gene expression changes and a correlation with microRNA signatures11,18.\n\nCentrifuge (brown circles) and aliquoting (white and green boxes and circles) protocols foraK2 EDTA tubes designated for EVP isolationbCPTsccfDNA BCTs ans.ddSST.\n\nAdditional PBMCs, plasma, and serum were collected from CPTs (Fig.4a), cfDNA BCTs (Fig.4d), SSTs (Fig.4c), as well as red blood cell pellets. CPTs were spun and aliquoted according to the manufacturer's instructions (Fig.3b). Plasma volume per tube ranged from 3000 14,000 uL per tube (Fig.4d). Because of technical issues in the sample processing procedure, three instances occurred where plasma retrieval from the CPT tubes was not possible. Plasma can be used to validate or refute previous studies, including cytokine panel10,29, exosomal RNA seq25,26, extracellular vesicle microRNA30, and proteomic20,31 33results. PBMCs were also collected, aliquoted into 6 cryovials per CPT, and stored in liquid nitrogen after slowly cooled in a Mr. Frosty to  80 degreesC. These can be used to follow up on previous studies on adaptive immunity, cell function, and immune dysregulation8,34 39. The remaining red blood cell pellet mixtures from below the gel plug in each CPT Tube were stored at  20 degreesC.\n\naA spun CPT yields plasma, PBMCs, and a red blood cell pellet. PBMC from each tube were divided into 6 cryovials and viably frozen. Plasma was aliquoted and the pellet was frozen at  20C.bA spun cfDNA BCT yields plasma and a red blood cell pellet. Plasma was purified with an additional spin (see Fig.4a) then aliquoted. The pellet was frozen at  20C.cA spun SST yields serum and a red blood cell pellet. Serum was aliquoted and the pellet was frozen at  20C.dCPT plasma volumes per timepoint are reported.ecfDNA (Streck) BCT plasma volumes per timepoint.fSST serum volumes per timepoint. An extra tube was drawn for C004 at R+45, resulting in a higher serum yield.\n\ncfDNA BCT (Streck) tubes were collected to isolate high quality cfDNA from plasma. cfDNA BCTs were spun and aliquoted according to the manufacturer's instructions (Fig.3c). The remaining cell pellet mixture was frozen at  20 degreesC. Plasma volume per timepoint ranged from 1500 5000 uL (Fig.4e). 500 uL aliquots were frozen at  80 degreesC. cfDNA extracted from these tubes can be analyzed for fragment length, mitochondrial or nuclear origin, and cell type or tissue of origin40 42.\n\nThe SST was spun and aliquoted according to the manufacturer's instructions (Fig.3d). Serum volume ranged from 2000 8000 uL per timepoint (Fig.4f). Similar to plasma, serum can be allocated for cytokine analysis and can also be used to perform comprehensive metabolic panels, including one we used at Quest (CMP, Quest Test Code: 10231) for metrics on alkaline phosphatase, calcium, glucose, potassium, and sodium, among other metabolic markers. The remaining cell pellet mixture from each SST tube was stored at  20 degreesC.\n\nIn addition to venous blood, capillary blood was collected onto a DBS card using a contact activated lancet pressed against the fingertip (Fig.5a). Capillary blood was collected onto a Whatman 903 Protein Saver DBS card to preserve nucleic acids and proteins. Each of the five spots on the DBS card hold 75 80uL of capillary blood, however, the amount of capillary blood collected across timepoints varied (Fig.5b,c) according to how much blood could be collected before the lancet puncture closed.\n\naDBS cards were collected preflight, during flight, and postflight. There were five spots for blood collection per card.bBlood collections varied in saturation level across blood spots and timepoints. These were classified as \"full\", \"partial\", and occasionally \"empty\".cDBS card yields per blood spot, per timepoint, and per crew member.\n\nSaliva was collected at the L 92, L 44, L 3, FD1, FD2, FD3, R+1, R+45, and R+82 timepoints using two methods. First, saliva was collected using the OMNIgene Oral Kit (OME 505), which preserves nucleic acids (Fig.6a) during the ground timepoints. From these samples, DNA, RNA, and protein were extracted. DNA yield ranged from 28.1 to 3187.8ng, RNA yield from 396.0 to 3544.2ng (less the two samples had concentrations too low for measurement), and protein concentration from 92.97 to 93.15ng.\n\naDNA, RNA, and protein yields from the OMNIgene Oral kits.bVolume of crude saliva collected per timepoint.\n\nSecond, crude saliva (i.e., saliva with no preservative added) was collected into a 5mL DNase/RNase free screw top tube during the ground and flight timepoints. Saliva volume varied from 150 to 4000 uL per tube (Fig.6b). Crude saliva was also collected during flight (FD2 and FD3), in addition to the ground timepoints.\n\nSaliva collections have been conducted throughout spaceflight studies for assessing the immune state of crews, particularly in the context of viral reactivation. Previously identified viruses that reactivate during spaceflight include Epstein Barr, varicella zoster, and cytomegalovirus43. Responses to reactivation of these viruses can be asymptomatic, debilitating, or even life threatening, thus assessing these adaptations is beneficial in understanding viral spaceflight activity as well as crew health. In addition to viral nucleic acid quantification, numerous biochemical assays can also be performed, including measurements of C reactive protein (CRP), cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and cytokines, among others10,43 46.\n\nUrine was collected in sterile specimen cups at the L 92, L 44, L 3, R+1, R+45, and R+82 timepoints. Specimen cups were collected 1 2 times per day. For preservation, urine was aliquoted and stored at  80 degreesC. Half the urine had Zymo Urine Conditioning Buffer (UCB) added before freezing, to preserve nucleic acids. Samples yielded 23 155.5mL of crude urine and 21   112mL of UCB urine per specimen cup (Fig.7a). Urine was split into 1mL   15mL aliquots before freezing at  80 degreesC.\n\naUrine volumes per timepoint. Volumes are reported for both crude urine and urine preserved with Zymo urine conditioning buffer (UCB).bTimepoints that stool tubes were collected. \"Gut\" tubes are OMNIgeneGUT tubes for microbiome preservation. \"Met\" tubes are OMNImetGUT tubes for metabolome preservation.cStool \"Gut\" tube DNA and RNA extraction quantities.\n\nA wide variety of assays can be performed on urine samples. Previous studies have included viral reactivation43,46,47, urinary cortisol48,49, iron and magnesium measurements50 53, bone status54 56, kidney stones54,55, proteomics11, telomere measurements57, and various biomarkers and metabolites17,49,58 61.\n\nStool was collected at the L 92, L 44, R+1, R+45, and R+82 timepoints. Stool samples were stored into two collection containers at each timepoint, one DNA Genotek OMNIgene Gut (OMR 200) kit with a preservative for metagenomics and another (ME 200) with a preservative for metabolomics (Fig.7b). Stool was the least consistent sample collected due to the limited windows available for sampling during collection timeframes. DNA and RNA were extracted from aliquots of the OMNIgene Gut (OMR 200) tubes for downstream microbiome analysis. DNA yield ranged from 358.5 to 16,660ng, RNA from 690 to 2010 ng (Fig.7c). Large variations in yield are attributable to variable stool mass collected between kits.\n\nStool samples enable various biochemical, immune, and microbiome changes studies. Previous metagenomic assays have found that shannon alpha diversity and richness during long duration missions to the ISS62.\n\nBody swabs were collected at all timepoints. Samples were collected by swabbing the body region of interest for 30seconds, then placing the swab in a sterile 2D matrix tube (Thermo Scientific #3710) with Zymo DNA/RNA shield preservative. For the first two swab locations, the oral and nasal cavity, the swab was placed directly on the body after removal from its sterile packaging (dry swab method; Fig.8a). For the remaining body locations, the swab was briefly dipped in nuclease free, DNA/RNA free water before proceeding (wet swab method). Eight distinct sites were swabbed with the wet swab method: post auricular, axillary vault, volar forearm, occiput, umbilicus, gluteal crease, glabella, and the toe web space (Fig.8b). The astronaut microbiome has previously been studied in the forehead, forearm, nasal, armpit, navel, postauricular, and tongue body locations, and changes have been documented during flight. Changes in alpha diversity and beta diversity were documented, as well as shifts in microbial genera62. However, the impact of these changes on skin health and immunological health are not well understood.\n\naDry swabs were collected from two body locations.bWet swabs were collected from eight body locations.cSwabs were collected from the deltoid region. Immediately after, 3  or 4 mm skin biopsies were collected from the same area and divided for histology and spatially resolved transcriptomics.\n\nAcquiring extensive swab samples from the crew skin allows for characterization of the habitat environment, crew skin microbiome adaptations, and interactions with potential human health adaptations resulting from spaceflight exposure. This is very relevant for crew health, considering astronauts become more susceptible to infections during spaceflight missions63, with the relationship between microbe host interactions from spaceflight exposure, which may be a causative factor of astronauts immune dysfunction, which is still not well understood.\n\nA skin biopsy on the deltoid was obtained from the L 44 and R+1 timepoint. Biopsies were also collected in advance of a flight to ensure the biopsy site is fully healed before the flight so there is no risk of complication. The wet swab method was used to collect the skin microbiome before the skin biopsy. The skin biopsies were 3 4 millimeters in diameter and were collected for histology and spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) (Fig.8c). One third of the sample was stored in formalin and kept at room temperature to perform histology. The remaining two thirds of the sample was stored in a cryovial and placed at  80 degreesC for SRT (Fig.8c). This is the first sample collected from astronauts for spatially resolved transcriptomics. The skin is of high interest due to the inflammation related cytokine markers such as IL 12p40, IL 10, IL 17A, and IL 1810,17and skin rash's status as the most frequent clinical symptom reported during spaceflight64.\n\nEnvironmental swabs were collected in flight during the F1 and F2 timepoint. Additionally, environmental swabs were collected from the flight simulation capsule at SpaceX headquarters after days of crew training during the L 92 and L 44 timepoints. Environmental swabs were collected using the wet swab method. Ten environmental swabs were collected per time point at the following locations in the capsule: an ambient air/control swab, the execute button, the viewing dome, the side hatch mobility aid, the lid of the waste locker, the head section of one of the seats, the commode panel, the right and left sides of the control screen, and the g meter button (Fig.9a d). Additionally, the spacecraft's high efficiency particulate absorbing (HEPA) filter was acquired post flight. This filter was cut into 127 rectangular pieces (1.2\" x 1.6\" x 4\") and stored at  20 degreesC.\n\naSwab locations, descriptions, and label IDs.bInterior view of the SpaceX Dragon capsule.cView of the control panel located above the middle seats in the Dragon capsule.dView of the cupola (viewing dome) region from the outside. The rim of the dome was swabbed from the inside (ID 10).\n\nPrevious microbial profiling of spacecraft environments has revealed that equipment sterilized on the ground becomes coated in microbial life in space due to interactions with crew and the introduction of equipment that has not undergone sterilization65. Subsequent microbial monitoring assays performed on the ISS have detected novel, spaceflight specific species on the ISS66. Once in space, surface microbes are subject to the unique microgravity and radiation environment of flight, which will influence evolutionary trajectory. The potential impact of this influence on pathogenesis is a concern for long duration space missions, especially given that changes in host pathogen interactions may also be affected during spaceflight67.",
    "discussion": "We report here on biospecimen samples collected from the SpaceX I4 Mission, the most comprehensive human biological specimen collection effort performed on an astronaut cohort to date. The extensive archive of biospecimens included venous blood, dried blood spot cards, saliva, urine, stool, microbiome body swabs, skin biopsies, and environmental capsule swabs. The study objective was to establish a foundational set of methods for biospecimen collection and banking on commercial spaceflight missions suitable for multi omic and molecular analysis. Biospecimens were collected to enable comprehensive, multi omic profiles, which can then be used to develop molecular catalogs with higher resolution of human responses to spaceflight. Select, targeted measures in clinical labs (CLIA) were also performed immediately after sample collection (CBC, CMP), and samples and viable cells were preserved in a long term Cornell Aerospace Medicine Biobank, such that additional assays and measures can be conducted in the future.\n\nGreat care was put into the standardization of sample processing between field laboratories in Hawthorne, Cape Canaveral, and Houston. Despite our best efforts to control for all preanalytical variables68, there are some inconsistencies in sample processing that were unavoidable during this mission. Of note, there was no access to cold stowage during flight, causing all samples to be stowed at room temperature until they arrived back on Earth. Of the three sample types collected during flight, two were stable at room temperature (skin/capsule swabs stored in DNA/RNA shield and capillary blood collected on dried blood spot cards). The third (saliva samples), were not stored in a preservative and, for this reason, will have a distinct profile compared to other timepoints. This limits the context in which these samples will be useful, but will still provide biological insights in more targeted biological studies. We can imagine situations in the future where there will be tradeoffs between standardization of sample collection with previous missions and mission specific constraints influencing the selection of biospecimen collection methods.\n\nHowever, there are several reasons why rigorous biospecimen collection methods for commercial and private spaceflight missions must be developed, which are scalable and translational across populations, missions, and mission parameters. First, little is known about the biological and clinical responses that occur in civilians during and after space travel. While professional astronauts are generally young, healthy, and extensively trained, civilian astronauts have been, and likely will be, far more heterogeneous. They will possess a variety of phenotypes, including older ages, different health backgrounds, and greater medication use, and may experience different medical conditions, risks, and comorbidities. Careful molecular characterization will be beneficial for the development of appropriate baseline metrics and countermeasures and, therefore, beneficial for the individual spaceflight experience. In the future, such analyses may enable precision medicine applications aimed at optimizing countermeasures for each individual astronaut who enters and returns safely from space69,70.\n\nSecond, multi omic studies inherently present a large number of measurements within a small set of subjects. These high dimensional datasets present numerous potential challenges with regard to the amplification of noise, risk of overfitting, and false discoveries71. At all times, scientists engaged in multi omic analyses must take special care that true biological variance is what has been measured. The introduction of experimental variance through the progression from sample collection, transport, and storage, to sequencing and analysis can introduce artifacts of variance that render the detection of true biological variance and interpretation of results more difficult. For this reason, tight adherence to experimental controls or annotation at every step of the experimental condition is crucial. Careful annotation allows for the assignment of class variables in post hoc analysis. Among such applications are the attempt to detect batch effects or determine the impact of variations in temperature (collection, storage, or transport)72.\n\nThe necessary means to address experimental variance are longitudinal sampling and specimen aliquoting. Longitudinal sampling (i.e. collecting numerous serial samples from each test condition) from pre flight, in flight, and post flight allows for greater statistical power when assessing changes attributable to spaceflight. In addition, each sample collected should be divided upon collection into multiple aliquots. This better assures that freeze thaw cycles can be avoided in the analysis stage, as freeze thaw events can introduce considerable experimental variance depending on the molecular class being measured. Maintaining all samples at their optimal storage temperature at all times, typically  80 degreesC or lower (e.g. liquid nitrogen for cells), is crucial73. Special attention must be given to how the collection and storage methods in flight vary in relation to the conditions on Earth. Spaceflight presents considerable differences in the operating environment, where ground conditions are far easier to control than flight. In practice, this may limit the types of samples that can be collected during flight.\n\nThird, rigorous methods must be developed and followed to pursue comparisons across missions with varying design parameters. In this consideration, there is an argument for the development of specimen collection, transport, storage, processing, analysis, and reporting standards. At the same time, this must be balanced with the flexibility required for innovation since standards can sometimes limit advancement in methodology. In the present study, common methods were used for the I4 and the Polaris Dawn and Axiom 2 missions. However, selected methods may require optimization for Polaris Dawn like missions, to increase the yields during sample processing and adapt to unique parameters imposed by the anticipated spacewalk (extravehicular activity; EVA). Moreover, within standards or best practices, unique research for each mission may require alteration of previously successful methods. With these considerations in mind, we must balance methodology standardization with advances in methodology options and mission specific objectives.\n\nAs the commercial spaceflight sector gains momentum and more astronauts with different health profiles and backgrounds have access to space, comprehensive data on the biological impact of short duration spaceflight is of paramount importance. Such data will further expand our understanding and knowledge of how spaceflight affects human physiology, microbial adaptations, and environmental biology. The use of integrative omics technologies for civilian astronauts has revealed novel responses across genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, microbiome, and transcriptomics measures74 83. Creating multi omic datasets from spaceflight studies on astronaut cohorts will further advance our understanding, inform future mission planning, and help discover what appropriate countermeasures can be developed to minimize future risk and enhance performance.\n\nValidating sample collection methodologies initially in short duration commercial spaceflight is a key step for future human health research in long duration and exploration class missions to the Moon and beyond. To help meet these challenges, we have established the SOMA protocols, which detail standard multi omic measures of astronaut health and protocols for sample collection from astronaut cohorts. Although the all civilian I4 crew pioneered the first use of the SOMA protocols, the methodology outlined here is robust and generalizable, making it applicable to future astronaut crews from any commercial mission provider (e.g., SpaceX, Axiom Space, Sierra Space, Blue Origin) or space agencies (NASA, ESA, JAXA, ROSCOSMOS). Furthermore, the SOMA banking, sequencing, and processing methods are a springboard for continuing biospecimen analysis and expanding our knowledge of multi omic dynamics before, during, and after human spaceflight missions, providing a molecular roadmap for crew health, medical biometrics, and possible countermeasures.",
