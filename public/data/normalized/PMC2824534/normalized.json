    "abstract": "Three dimensionally woven poly( caprolactone)(PCL) scaffolds were combined with adult human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) to engineer mechanically functional cartilage constructsin vitro. The specific objectives were to: (i) produce PCL scaffolds with cartilage like mechanical properties, (ii) demonstrate that hMSCs formed cartilage after 21 days of culture on PCL scaffolds, and (iii) study effects of scaffold structure (loosely vs. tightly woven), culture vessel (static dish vs. oscillating bioreactor), and medium composition (chondrogenic additives with or without serum). Aggregate moduli of 21 day constructs approached normal articular cartilage for tightly woven PCL cultured in bioreactors, were lower for tightly woven PCL cultured statically, and lowest for loosely woven PCL cultured statically (p<0.05). Construct DNA, total collagen, and glyocosaminoglycans (GAG) increased in a manner dependent on time, culture vessel, and medium composition. Chondrogenesis was verified histologically by rounded cells within a hyaline like matrix that immunostained for collagen type II but not type I. Bioreactors yielded constructs with higher collagen content (p<0.05) and more homogenous matrix than static controls. Chondrogenic additives yielded constructs with higher GAG (p<0.05) and earlier expression of collagen II mRNA if serum was not present in medium. These results show feasibility of functional cartilage tissue engineering from hMSC and 3D woven PCL scaffolds.\n\nKeywords:Cartilage repair, stem cell, bioreactor, biomechanics, growth factors",
    "methods": "All tissue culture reagents were from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA) unless otherwise specified.\n\nA custom built loom[19] was used to weave PCL multi filament yarns (24 um diameter per filament; 44 filaments/yarn, Grilon KE 60, EMS/Griltech, Domat, Switzerland) in three orthogonal directions (x warp, y weft, and a vertical z direction) (Figure 1A). A loosely woven scaffold was made with widely spaced warp yarns (8 yarns/cm), closely spaced weft yarns (20 yarns/cm) and two z layers between each warp yarn (Figure 1B). A tightly woven scaffold was made with closely spaced warp and weft yarns (24 and 20 yarns/cm, respectively) and one z layer between each warp yarn. (Figure 1C). These weaving parameters, in conjunction with fiber size and the density of PCL (1.145 g/cm3)[41], determined scaffold porosity and pore dimensions. The loosely woven scaffold had porosity of 68 +/  0.3%, approximate pore dimensions of 850 um x1100 um x 100 um, and approximate thickness of 0.9 mm. The tightly woven scaffold had porosity of 61 +/  0.2 %, approximate pore dimensions of 330 um x 260 um x 100 um and approximate thickness of 1.3 mm. Prior to cell culture, scaffolds were immersed in 4N NaOH for 18 h, thoroughly rinsed in de ionized water, dried, ethylene oxide sterilized, and punched into 7 mm diameter discs using dermal punches (Acuderm Inc., Ft. Lauderdale, FL).\n\nThe 3D woven PCL scaffold. (A) schematic; (B C) scanning electron micrographs of (B) loosely and (C) tightly woven scaffolds. Scale bars: 1 mm.\n\nThe hMSCs were derived from bone marrow aspirates obtained from a healthy middle aged adult male at the Hematopoietic Stem Cell Core Facility at Case Western Reserve University. Informed consent was obtained, and an Institutional Review Board approved aspiration procedure was used[42]. Briefly, the bone marrow sample was washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM LG, Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) from a selected lot[9]. The sample was centrifuged at 460xgon a pre formed Percoll density gradient (1.073 g/mL) to isolate the mononucleated cells. These cells were resuspended in serum supplemented medium and seeded at a density of 1.8x105cells/cm2in 10 cm diameter plates. Non adherent cells were removed after four days by changing the medium. For the remainder of the cell expansion phase, the medium was additionally supplemented with 10 ng/mL of recombinant human fibroblast growth factor basic (rhFGF 2, Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ)[43], and was replaced twice per week. The primary culture was trypsinized after approximately two weeks, and then cryopreserved using Gibco Freezing medium.\n\nThe hMSC were thawed and expanded by approximately 10 fold during a single passage in which cells were plated at 5,500 cells/cm2and cultured in DMEM LG supplemented with 10% FBS, 10 ng/mL of rhFGF 2, and 1% penicillin streptomycin fungizone. Medium was completely replaced every 2 3 days for 7 days. Multi potentiality was verified for the expanded hMSC by inducing differentiation into the chondrogenic lineage in pellet cultures of passage 2 (P2) cells[44], and into adipogenic and osteogenic lineages in monolayer culture[45]. The PCL scaffolds (a total of n= 15 20 per group, in three independent studies) were seeded with P2 hMSC by mixing cells in growth factor reduced Matrigel(B&D Biosciences) while working at 4 degreesC, and pipetting the cell gel mixture evenly onto both surfaces of the PCL scaffold. Each 7 mm diameter, 0.9 mm thick loosely woven scaffold was seeded with a cell pellet (1 million cells in 10 uL) mixed with 25 uL of Matrigel, whereas each 7 mm diameter, 1.3 mm thick tightly woven scaffold was seeded with a similar cell pellet mixed with 35 uL of Matrigel. Freshly seeded constructs were placed in 24 well plates (one construct per well), placed in a 37 degreesC in a humidified, 5% CO2/room air incubator for 30 min to allow Matrigelgelation, and then 1 mL of medium was added to each well.\n\nAfter 24 h, constructs were transferred either into 6 well plates (one construct per well containing 9 mL of medium) and cultured statically, or into bioreactor chambers as previously described[27]. Briefly, each construct allocated to the bioreactor group was placed in a custom built poly(dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS) chamber that was connected to a loop of gas permeable silicone rubber tubing (1/32 inch wall thickness, Cole Parmer, Vernon Hills, IL). Each loop was then mounted on a supporting disc, and medium (9 mL) was added, such that the construct was submerged in medium in the lower portion of the loop and a gas bubble was present in the upper portion of the loop[27]. Multiple loops were mounted on an incubator compatible base that slowly oscillated the chamber about an arc of ~160 degrees. Importantly, bioreactor oscillation directly applied bi directional medium percolation and mechanical stimulation to their upper and lower surfaces of the discoid constructs.\n\nThree different medium compositions (DM1, DM2 and CM) were studied. Differentiation medium 1 (DM1) was DMEM HG supplemented with 10% FBS, 10 ng/mL hTGFbeta 3 (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ), 1% ITS+ Premix (B&D Biosciences), 10 7M dexamethasone (Sigma), 50 mg/L ascorbic acid, 0.4 mM proline, 0.1 mM non essential amino acids, 10 mM HEPES, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 U/mL streptomycin, and 0.25 ug/mL of fungizone. Differentiation medium 2 (DM2) was identical to DM1 except without FBS. Control medium (CM) was identical to DM1 except without chondrogenic additives (TGFbeta 3, ITS+ Premix, and dexamethasone). Media were replaced at a rate of 50% every 3 4 days, and constructs were harvested after 1, 7, 14, and 21 days.\n\nConfined compression tests[46] were performed on 3 mm diameter cylindrical test specimens cored from the centers of 21 day constructs or acellular (initial) scaffolds using an ELF 3200 materials testing system (Bose Enduratec, Framingham, MA). Specimens (n = 5 6 per group) placed in a 3 mm diameter confining chamber within a bath of phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and compressive loads were applied using a solid piston against a rigid porous platen (porosity of 50%, pore size of 50 100 um). Following equilibration of a 10 gf tare load, a step compressive load of 30 gf was applied to the sample and allowed to equilibrate for 2000s. Aggregate modulus (HA) and hydraulic permeability (k) were determined numerically by matching the solution for axial strain (z) to the experimental data for all creep tests using a two parameter, nonlinear least squares regression procedure[47,48]. Unconfined compression tests were done by applying strains, , of 0.04, 0.08, 0.12, and 0.16 to the specimens (n = 5 6 per group) in a PBS bath after equilibration of a 2% tare strain. Strain steps were held constant for 900s which allowed the specimens to relax to an equilibrium level. Young's modulus was determined by linear regression on the resulting equilibrium stress strain plot.\n\nHistological analyses were performed after specimens (n = 2 constructs per time point per group) were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 24 h at 4 degreesC, post fixed in 70% ethanol, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned bothen faceand in cross section. Sections 5 um thick were stained with safranin O/fast green for proteoglycans. For immunohistochemical analysis, 20 um thick sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated. To efficiently expose epitopes, the sections were incubated with 700 U/mL bovine testicular hyaluronidase (Sigma) and 2 U/mL pronase XIV (Sigma) for 1 h at 37 degreesC. Double immunostaining for collagen type I (mouse monoclonal antibody, ab6308; Abcam Inc. Cambridge, MA) and collagen type II (mouse monoclonal anitibody, CII/CI; Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa) was performed using an Avidin/Biotin kit (Vector lab, Burlingame, CA). Control sections were incubated with PBS/1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) without primary antibody.\n\nStandard assays for DNA, ortho hydroxyproline (OHP, an index of total collagen content), and GAG (an index of proteoglycan content) were performed (n = 3 4 bisected constructs per time point per group). Values obtained for all 1 day constructs produced from tightly woven PCL scaffolds in DM1, DM2, and CM groups were pooled, averaged, and used as a basis for comparison for subsequent (7, 14, and 21 day) constructs produced from tightly woven scaffolds. After measuring wet weight, constructs were diced and digested in papain for 12 h at 60 degreesC. DNA was measured using the Quant iT PicoGreendsDNA assay (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). GAG was measured using the Blyscan sulphated GAG assay (Biocolor, Carrickfergus, Northern Ireland). To measure total collagen, papain digests were hydrolyzed in HCl at 110 degreesC overnight, dried in a desiccating chamber, reconstituted in acetate citrate buffer, filtered through activated charcoal, and OHP was quantified by Ehrlich's reaction[49]. Briefly, hydrolysates were oxidized with chloramine T, treated with dimethylaminobenzaldehyde, read at 540 nm against a trans 4 hydroxy L proline standard curve, and total collagen was calculated by using a ratio of 10 ug of collagen per 1 ug of 4 hydroxyproline. The conversion factor of 10 was selected since immunohistochemical staining showed that type II collagen represented virtually all of the collagen present in the constructs[50,51].\n\nThe presence of two cartilage biomarkers were tested: Sox 9, one of the earliest markers for MSC differentiation towards the chondrocytic lineage, preceding the activation of collagen II[52], and collagen type II, a chondrocyte related gene. Collagen type I provided a marker for undifferentiated MSCs, and GAPDH provided an intrinsic control[53]. Total RNA was isolated from hMSCs prior to and after culture on PCL scaffolds (n = 3 4 bisected constructs per group per time point) using a Qiagen RNeasy mini kit. DNase treated RNA was used to make first stranded cDNA with the SuperScript III First Strand Synthesis for RT PCR. The cDNA was amplified in a iCycler Thermal Cycler 582BR (Bio Rad, Hercules, CA) using primer sequences given inTable 1. The cycling conditions were as follows: 2 min at 94 degreesC; 30 cycles of (30 s at 94 degreesC, 45s at 58 degreesC, 1min at 72 degreesC), and 5 min at 72 degreesC. The PCR products were analyzed by means of 2% agarose gel electrophoresis containing ethidium bromide (E Gel2%, Invitrogen).\n\nThe sequences of PCR primers (sense and antisense, 5' to 3'):\n\nData were calculated as mean +/  standard error and analyzed using multi way analysis of variance (ANOVA) in conjunction with Tukey'spost hoctest using Statistica (v. 7, Tulsa, OK, USA). Values ofp <0.05were considered statistically significant.",
    "results": "Scaffold structure did not have any significant effect on the amounts of DNA, total collagen, or GAG in constructs cultured statically for 21 days in DM1 (Table 2, Group Avs.B). In contrast, scaffold structure significantly impacted aggregate modulus (HA) and Young's modulus (E) of initial (acellular) scaffolds and cultured constructs (Figure 2). Acellular loosely woven scaffolds exhibited lower(p<0.05)mechanical properties (HAof 0.18 +/  0.011 MPa and E of 0.042 +/  0.004 MPa) than acellular tightly woven scaffolds (HAof 0.46 +/  0.049 MPa and E of 0.27 +/  0.017 MPa). Likewise, 21 day constructs based on loosely woven scaffolds exhibited lower(p<0.05)mechanical properties (HAof 0.16 +/  0.006 MPa and E of 0.064 +/  0.004 MPa) than constructs based on tightly woven scaffolds (HAof 0.37 +/  0.030 MPa and E of 0.41 +/  0.023 MPa) (Figure 2). As compared to acellular scaffolds, the 21 day constructs exhibited similar aggregate modulus and higher (p<0.05) Young's modulus.\n\nMechanical and biochemical properties of hMSC PCL constructs after short term culture\n\nStatic = culture in petri dish; Bioreactor = culture in gas permeable loop with slow, bi directional oscillation; DM1 = differentiation medium #1; DM2 = differentiaiton medium #2; CM = control medium n= number of samples tested; NM=not measured.\n\nmulti way ANOVA for Groups A C for the culture time of 21 days showed significant effects of scaffold structure and culture vessel\n\nmulti way ANOVA for Groups A D for culture times of 1 to 21 days showed significant effects of time, culture vessel, and culture medium composition\n\nSignificant effect due to scaffold structure\n\nSignificant effect due to culture vessel\n\nSignificant effect due to presence of FBS in culture medium\n\nSignificant effect due to presence of chondrogenic additives in culture medium\n\n(A) Aggregate and (B) Young's moduli of 21 day constructs based on hMSC and either loosely or tightly woven PCL scaffolds, and cultured either statically or in bioreactors. *Significant difference due to scaffold structure; **Significant difference due to culture vessel.\n\nAggregate modulus of 21 day constructs based on tightly woven PCL and cultured in bioreactors was higher (p<0.05) than that measured for otherwise similar constructs cultured statically (Figure 2,Table 2). Construct amounts of DNA, total collagen, and GAG increased in a manner dependent on time, culture vessel and medium composition. DNA and GAG contents were similar in 21 day constructs cultured in bioreactors and statically (Figures 3A and 3C). Total collagen content was 1.5 fold higher (p< 0.05) in bioreactor compared to static cultures (Figure 3B;Table 2, Group Bvs.C). Bioreactors yielded more homogeneous tissue development than static cultures based on qualitative histological appearance of cross sections (Figure 4, row I). Chondrogenesis was demonstrated histologically by rounded cells within a hyaline like matrix that immunostained strongly and homogeneously positive for collagen type II. Bioreactors yielded constructs in which Coll II immunostaining was more pronounced than static cultures (Figure 4, row IV). Immunostaining for Col I was minimal under all conditions tested. The RT PCR analysis showed type of culture vessel did not affect the temporal expression of mRNAs for collagen type II (Figure 5A), Sox 9 (Figure 5B), collagen type I (not shown) and GAPDH (not shown).\n\nAmounts of (A) DNA, (B) total collagen, and (C) glycosaminoglycans (GAG) in constructs produced from tightly woven scaffolds and hMSC cultured for up to 21 days, statically or in bioreactors in DM1, statically in DM2, and statically in CM.aSignificant difference due to type of culture vessel,bSignificant difference due to serum,cSignificant difference due to chondrogenic additives.\n\nHistological appearance of constructs produced from tightly woven scaffolds and hMSC cultured for 21 days statically in DM1 (column 1), in bioreactors in DM1 (column 2), statically in DM2 (column 3) or statically in CM (column 4).

Also, total collagen content was 1.8 fold higher (p<0.05) in 21 day constructs cultured in DM1 compared to DM2 (Figure 3B). Conversely, GAG content was lower (42% as high,p<0.05) in 21 day constructs cultured in DM1 compared to DM2 (Figure 3C). Likewise, the GAG/DNA ratio was lower (30% as high,p<0.05) in 21 day constructs cultured in DM1 compared to DM2 (Table 2). Culture in DM2 yielded more chondrogenic differentiation of hMSC than DM1, based on histological appearance of cells and ECM (more rounded chondrocytes; more homogeneously positive matrix staining for GAG and Coll II,Figure 4, rows III and IV). Culture in DM2 yielded earlier expression of collagen type II mRNA (Figure 5A) such that this biomarker was present by day 7 in contrast to DM1. Constructs cultured in CM contained substantially lower amounts collagen and GAG compared to DM1 (Table 2, Group B vs. E). Chondrogenic differentiation was virtually absent in constructs cultured in CM with respect to rounded cell shape, matrix staining for GAG and collagen type II, and measured GAG and collagen contents (Figure 3andFigure 4).",
    "discussion": "The findings of this study demonstrate the ability to produce functional tissue engineered cartilage starting from hMSC and a tightly woven PCL scaffold within 21 daysin vitro. Importantly, aggregate and Young's moduli of hMSC PCL constructs cultured statically and in bioreactors (Table 2, Groups B and C), approached the values reported for normal articular cartilage (HAof 0.1 to 2.0 MPa; E of 0.4 to 0.8 MPa)[54 56]. Young's modulus was higher for 21 day constructs than initial acellular scaffolds, which may be due to accumulation of cell derived cartilaginous extracellular matrix within the 3D woven scaffold and associated increase in shear modulus. These effects would be expected to reduce relative PCL yarn movement and cross sectional shape distortion during compressive testing and have a more pronounced effect during mechanical testing in the unconfined configuration (i.e., where scaffolds are not laterally constrained) than the confined configuration, thereby affecting E more than HA. Although short term maintenance of mechanical properties of constructs and scaffolds was demonstrated, further studies of constructs and acellular scaffolds are warranted to assess mechanical properties over longer time periods. Long term maintenance can be reasonably expected due to the slow biodegradation of PCL[23,24] in concert with continued accumulation of cell derived cartilaginous matrix.\n\nEfficient hMSC seeding and cartilaginous matrix deposition were observed for loosely and tightly woven PCL scaffolds, and can be attributed to the combination of Matrigel enhanced cell entrapment[25] and large, homogenously distributed pores in the scaffold (i.e.in plane pores of 250 to 1000 um,Figure 1). Consistently, scaffolds with 250 to 500um pores were found to enhance GAG secretion as compared to smaller pores[57], and 380 to 405 um pores were found suitable for chondrocyte proliferation[58]. Culture in an oscillating bioreactor yielded constructs with higher aggregate modulus, higher total collagen content, and more homogeneous tissue development, especially at the upper and lower surfaces than otherwise identical static cultures (Figure 2 Figure 4). Constructs from the oscillating bioreactor exhibited strongly positive immunostaining for Coll II and virtually negative staining for Coll I, although collagen type II as a fraction of the total collagen was not explicitly measured. We previously showed that constructs from rotating bioreactors contained more total and type II collagen than statically cultured controls[12], and in these constructs Coll II represented 92 to 99 % of the total collagen[51,59]. Consistently, others showed hydrodynamic shear increased total collagen, type II collagen, and tensile modulus of multi layered chondrocyte sheets[60], and bi directional perfusion yielded more homogeneous tissue engineered cartilage than uni directional perfusion[35,36].\n\nCulture medium composition significantly impacted construct amounts of DNA and GAG, intensity of safranin O staining and Coll II immunostaining, and the temporal profile of chondrogenic differentiation by hMSC. Specifically, chondrogenic additives without serum (DM2) yielded constructs with higher GAG, higher GAG/DNA ratio, earlier expression of collagen II mRNA, and more homogenous immunostaining for Coll II as compared to chondrogenic additives with serum (DM1) (Figure 3 Figure 5). Consistently, serum was recently reported to inhibit chondrogenic differentiation of synoviocytes[38,39], and this finding was attributed to an enhanced proliferation of the cells that hindered their differentiation capacity. Interestingly, the GAG/DNA ratio measured in the present study at culture day 21 exceeded the GAG/DNA ratios previously reported after prolongedin vitrocultivation[17,39,61].",
    "conclusion": "In this work, a 3D woven PCL scaffold combined with adult human stem cells yielded mechanically functional tissue engineered cartilage constructs within only 21 daysin vitro. Scaffold structure significantly impacted construct aggregate and Young's moduli (i.e., tightly woven scaffolds yielded constructs with higher moduli than more loosely woven scaffolds). Importantly, compressive moduli of 21 day constructs based on tightly woven scaffolds approached values reported for normal articular cartilage. Production of constructs with robust mechanical properties was accelerated by culture in oscillating bioreactors as compared to static dishes (i.e., the bioreactor yielded constructs with higher HA, higher total collagen content, more immunostaining for collagen type II, and more spatially homogenous tissue development). Chondrogenic differentiation of hMSC was observed only if culture medium was supplemented with chondrogenic additives (TGFbeta, ITS+ Premix), and was accelerated if this medium did not contain serum (i.e., lack of serum yielded constructs with higher GAG content, higher GAG/DNA ratio, earlier expression of collagen type II mRNA, and more pronounced matrix staining for GAG and collagen type II)."
