    "abstract": "Introduction:Space is a unique environment characterized by isolation from community life and exposure to circadian misalignment, microgravity, and space radiation. These multiple differences from those experienced on the earth may cause systemic and local tissue stress. Autonomic nerves, including sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves, regulate functions in multiple organs. Saliva is secreted from the salivary gland, which is regulated by autonomic nerves, and plays several important roles in the oral cavity and digestive processes. The balance of the autonomic nervous system in the seromucous glands, such as the submandibular glands, precisely controls serous and mucous saliva. Psychological stress, radiation damage, and other triggers can cause an imbalance in salivary secretion systems. A previous study reported that amylase is a stress marker in behavioral medicine and space flight crews; however, the detailed mechanisms underlying amylase regulation in the space environment are still unknown.\n\nMethods:In this study, we aimed to elucidate how lunar gravity (1/6g) changes mRNA expression patterns in the salivary gland. Using a multiple artificial gravity research system during space flight in the International Space Station, we studied the effects of two different gravitational levels, lunar and Earth gravity, on the submandibular glands of mice. All mice survived, returned to Earth from space, and their submandibular glands were collected 2days after landing.\n\nResults:We found that lunar gravity induced the expression of the salivary amylase geneAmy1; however, no increase inAqp5andAno1, which regulate water secretion, was observed. In addition, genes involved in the exocrine system, such as vesicle associated membrane protein 8 (Vamp8) and small G proteins, includingRap1andRabfamilies, were upregulated under lunar gravity.\n\nConclusion:These results imply that lunar gravity upregulates salivary amylase secretion viaRap/Rabsignaling and exocytosis viaVamp8. Our study highlightsAmy1as a potential candidate marker for stress regulation in salivary glands in the lunar gravity environment.\n\nKeywords:lunar gravity, salivary gland, small G protein, amy1, microarray",
    "methods": "C57BL/6J male mice (Stock #000664) obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME, United States) and Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA, United States) were used for the MHU 4 and  5 missions. All experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) (Protocol Number: No. 018 011D for MHU 4 and No. 018 036D for MHU 5), Explora Biolabs (Study Number: No. EB19 003 for MHU 4 and No. SP19 003 for MHU 5), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) (Protocol Number: No. FLT 18 118 for MHU 4 and No. JAXA MHU 5/FLT 19 121 for MHU 5). All experiments were conducted in accordance with the guidelines and applicable laws of Japan and the United States.\n\nThe ground control group (GC) comprised of six age matched (9 week old) male C57BL/6J mice per mission, maintained on Earth under the same conditions as those aboard the International Space Station (ISS). A detailed description of the space flight experiments has been previously reported (Hayashi et al., 2023).\n\nIn the MHU 4 mission, six 9 week old male C57BL/6J mice in a transportation cage unit were launched aboard SpX 17 on 7 May 2019, from the NASA Kennedy Space Center and were then transported to the ISS. The MHU 4 partial gravity (PG) group was maintained in an artificial gravity environment of 1/6gon the bottom floor of the habitat cage unit by centrifugation at 31rpm in MARS using a short radius (15cm) centrifuge (MARS S).\n\nIn the MHU 5 mission, six 9 week old male C57BL/6J mice in a transportation cage unit were launched aboard SpX 20 on 10 March 2020, from the NASA Kennedy Space Center and were then transported to the ISS. The MHU 5_PG group was maintained in an artificial gravity environment of 1/6gon the bottom floor of the habitat cage unit by centrifugation at 21rpm in MARS using a long radius (35cm) centrifuge (MARS L).\n\nThe lighting in the mouse habitat cage considered the circadian rhythm and used a 12 h cycle according to the ISS and GMT (standard) time, with a light period of 7:00 to 19:00 and a dark period from 19:00 to 7:00 the next day.\n\nCage unit was equipped with a water dispenser and a feeder that can automatically supply water and food. The crew only needed to periodically refill the water and replenish the food, reducing the workload of the crew. The water dispenser was based on a balloon for injecting medicines, and drinking water was supplied by pressurizing the water using the elasticity of the balloon. The amount of water in the balloon was able to be detected by a sensor when it was full and when a certain amount of water had been consumed from full. For feeding, a spring was used to push out integrally molded food to the feeding surface. Food needed to be replenished once a week, but the food in this device was in cartridge form, making it easy for the crew to replace the cartridges.\n\nAll the mice from each mission were sacrificed on the second day after returning to the Earth.\n\nSubmandibular glands were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Wako, Osaka, Japan) for 1 2d at 4 degreesC before replacing the paraformaldehyde with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The MHU 4 mission samples were processed in the United States in June 2019, and the MHU 5 mission samples were processed in the United States in April 2020. After approximately 40 d, the samples were treated with different concentrations of methanol, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%, for 30min each and then maintained in 100% methanol. The MHU 4 mission samples were processed in Japan in July 2019, and the MHU 5 mission samples were processed in Japan in May 2020.\n\nSamples from the ground control experiments were treated using the same method as those from the space experiments. The MHU 4 mission, samples were processed in December 2019; and the MHU 5 samples were processed in October 2020.\n\nTotal RNA from whole submandibular gland in each group (the MHU 4 GC, the MHU 4 PG, the MHU 5 GC, the MHU 5 PG); n = 1 for each was isolated from the cells using the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Germany), according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA samples were quantified using a Nanodrop ND 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States), and their quality was confirmed using a 2,200 TapeStation (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, United States).\n\nThe total RNA from whole submandibular gland in each group was amplified using GeneChipWT Pico Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and hybridized to the Clariom S Assay, mouse (Thermo Fisher Scientific), according to the manufacturer's instructions. All hybridized microarrays were scanned using an Affymetrix scanner (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Relative hybridization intensities and background hybridization values were calculated using Affymetrix Expression Console. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was conducted according to methods previously described (Mootha et al., 2003;Subramanian et al., 2005).\n\nThe raw signal intensities of all samples were normalized by a quantile algorithm using AffymetrixPower Tools version 1.15.0 software. To identify up  or downregulated genes, we calculated Z scores [Z] and ratios (non log scaled fold change) from the normalized signal intensities of each probe for comparison between the control and experimental samples. The criteria for upregulated genes was Z score >=2.0 and ratio >=1.5 fold and for downregulated genes was Z score <=  2.0 and ratio <=0.66. Since there were no replicate samples in this analysis, it was impossible to evaluate the data usingp values. We used intensity based Z scores and fold changes to extract differentially expressed mRNAs. This is expected to reduce noise compared to extracting variable mRNAs based only on fold change values (Quackenbush, 2002).\n\nWe conducted immunofluorescence staining by using the whole submandibular gland in each group (the MHU 4 GC, the MHU 4 PG, the MHU 5 GC, the MHU 5 PG); n = 1 for each. The fixed submandibular glands were embedded in paraffin, and 2um sections were prepared using a microtome (Leica Biosystems, Wetzlar, Germany). The sections were deparaffinized by immersing in xylene (Wako) for 10min three times. The sections were then rehydrated using sequential immersion in 100%, 95%, and 70% ethanol for 10min. After ethanol treatment, the sections were washed three times with PBS. For immunofluorescence analysis, the samples were permeabilized with Triton X 100 (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States) for 5min before incubating with blocking buffer (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) at room temperature for 15min. To evaluate the protein expression patterns, the samples were then incubated overnight at 4 degreesC with the following primary antibodies: mouse monoclonal anti Amylase (sc 46657; 1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Dallas, TX, United States), rabbit polyclonal anti Aquaporin5 (ab53212; 1:200; Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom), mouse monoclonal anti Rap1 (sc 398755; 1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), mouse monoclonal anti Rab2a (67501 1 Ig; 1:200; Proteintech, Rosemont, IL, United States), rabbit polyclonal anti Rab10 (11808 1 AP; 1:200; Proteintech), rabbit polyclonal anti Rab27b (13412 1 AP; 1:200; Proteintech), and rabbit polyclonal anti Vamp8 (15546 1 AP; 1:200; Proteintech).\n\nAfter washing with PBS, the following secondary antibodies were then incubated for 1h at room temperature: Alexa Fluor568 donkey anti mouse (#A10037; Thermo Fisher Scientific), Alexa Fluor488 donkey anti rabbit (#A21206, Thermo Fisher Scientific). After washing with PBS, the stained samples were mounted in a mounting reagent with 4,6 diamidino 2 phenylindole (ab104139; Abcam) and analyzed using a fluorescence microscope (X710, X800; Keyence, Osaka, Japan).",
    "results": "Microarray analysis to examine the changes in mRNA expression of the 22,206 genes found no correlation (correlation coefficient: 0.077052) between the submandibular gland samples obtained from the MHU 4 and  5 missions, even though both missions were conducted under the same lunar surface gravity environments (Figure 1). This may be due to differences in the centrifugal gradient caused by the radius of each MARS and circadian fluctuation between the time points for collecting samples in two missions.\n\nNo correlation of salivary gene expression was observed between the MHU 4 and  5 missions. Microarray analysis revealed no correlation between changes in the mRNA expression of 22,206 genes (correlation coefficient: 0.077052) between the MHU 4 and  5 missions.\n\nWe then investigated the cells comprising the submandibular glands and surrounding cell populations, based on specific marker, to identify which cell components showed specific mRNA expression changes in the lunar gravity environment in MHU 4 and  5. The heat map inFigure 2Ashows signal intensity ratio of mRNA expression in samples at 1gand 1/6genvironment in both MHU 4 and MHU 5 missions. Red indicates upregulated genes at 1/6gand green indicates downregulated genes at 1/6gcompared to the 1ggroup. Microarray analysis of whole submandibular glands samples from both MHU 4 and  5 revealed that the overall variation in mRNA expression was more pronounced in the MHU 4 mission than in the MHU 5 mission. Expression of mRNA relating the acinar cells, characterized byAmy1,Bhlha15,Sox10were more pronounced than those from other cell populations (Figure 2A). The expression of mRNA related to proliferation and apoptosis did not significantly increase at 1/6gcompared to the 1ggroup (Figure 2B). Therefore, we focused on mature acinar cells that have physiological functions such as protein and water secretion.\n\nIncreases of gene expression in acinar cells in lunar gravity environment.(A)Heat map shows representative mRNAs, encoding marker protein for the cells comprising submandibular gland. The map represents the ratio calculated from the signal intensity of 1/6g 1g.Microarray analysis revealed that the expression increases with significance were more seen in acinar cells. Gene expression increases were more observed in MHU 4 compared with those in MHU 5.(B)Genes relating to cell proliferation and apoptosis showed no upregulation. Red in heat map indicates upregulated mRNA at 1/6gand green in heat map indicates downregulated mRNA at 1/6gcompared to the 1ggroup.\n\nAmy1encodes salivary amylase secreted by acinar cells, which is an organic component involved in serous saliva.Amy1showed significant upregulation in the samples in the 1/6genvironment during both MHU missions (Figure 3A). In contrast,Aqp5, which is involved in water secretion in acinar cells, was highly expressed (data not shown), but no significant changes in the mRNA expression were observed between lunar gravity and ground controls in either mission (Figure 3A). Immunofluorescence staining showed that the amylase protein was expressed at a higher level in lunar gravity than in the ground control, which was consistent with the microarray results. Aqp5 protein expression was also consistent with the microarray data (Figure 3B).\n\nUpregulation of salivaryAmy1in 1/6glunar gravity environment in both MHU 4 and MHU 5 missions.(A)Heat map showing the ratio calculated from the signal intensity of 1/6g 1g.Microarray analysis revealed that salivary protein geneAmy1was upregulated in 1/6glunar gravity in both MHU 4 and  5 missions. No significant increases ofAqp5were observed. Red in heat map indicates upregulated mRNA at 1/6gand green in heat map indicates downregulated mRNA at 1/6gcompared to the 1ggroup.(B)Immunofluorescence staining confirmed the increased expression of amylase in 1/6glunar gravity in both MHU 4 and  5 but no increase of Aqp5 even though the salivary cells were highly immunopositive for Aqp5. Scale bar: 50um.\n\nWe further examined signal intensity ratio of mRNA for membrane proteins with cytosolic coiled coil domains, termed SNAREs, which are found in vesicles (v SNAREs) and organelles (t SNAREs) in whole submandibular glands. Vesicle associated membrane protein 8 (Vamp8) is a v SNARE gene involved in protein vesicle secretion mainly by acinar cells and was highly expressed under lunar gravity in both MHU missions; however, there was no increase in t SNARE (Figure 4A). Based on these results, it was assumed that amylase secretion was promoted through Vamp8 in the 1/6glunar gravity environment compared to 1g. In samples from the both MHU 4 and MHU 5 missions, immunostaining revealed that amylase and Vamp8 protein expression was co localized within acinar cells. We also observed strong expression of Vamp8 protein at apical side of cell membrane in acinar cells at 1/6genvironment, implying enhancement of vesicle membrane docking to secrete salivary proteins (Figure 4B).\n\nUpregulation ofVamp8in the lunar gravity group in both MHU 4 and MHU 5.(A)Heat map showing the ratio calculated from the signal intensity of 1/6g 1g.Microarray analysis revealed changes in expression of the v SNARE gene,Vamp8.Other v SNARE genes such asVamp2,5, and7were upregulated at 1/6gcompared to the 1gin MHU 4. Upregulation of the t SNARE gene in lunar gravity was not observed. Red in heat map indicates upregulated mRNA at 1/6gand green in heat map indicates downregulated mRNA at 1/6gcompared to the 1ggroup.(B)Immunofluorescence staining confirmed the co localization of amylase and Vamp8 in acinar cells. Co localized expression of amylase and Vamp8 was higher in lunar gravity compared with ground control for MHU 4 and MHU 5 missions. Insets (white dotted rectangles) were enlarged from the yellow dotted rectangles. Arrowheads indicate strong expression of Vamp8 protein and amylase at apical side of cell membrane in acinar cells. Scale bar: 20um.\n\nMicroarray analysis showed an increase in the mRNA expression ofRap1b, a subfamily of theRasfamily in the 1/6glunar gravity of both MHU 4 and  5 groups (Figure 5A). The immunofluorescence staining results showed the upregulation of Rap1 protein, which were similar with the microarray data (Figure 5B). Increases of mRNA expression in samples from PG in both MHU 4 and MHU 5 missions were also observed forRab1,Rab2a,Rab10, andRab27, which are members of theRabfamily (Figure 6A). Immunofluorescence staining showed upregulation of Rab2a, Rab10, and Rab27 protein which were similar with the microarray data (Figure 6B). Upregulation of some mRNAs from theRho(Figure 7A),Sar/Arf(Figure 7B), andRan(Figure 7C) families was observed at 1/6gsamples but did not show common expression patterns between MHU 4 and  5 missions, except for GEF/GAP (Figures 7A C).\n\nUpregulation ofRap1in lunar gravity in both MHU 4 and MHU 5.(A)Heat map showing the ratio calculated from the signal intensity of 1/6g 1g.Microarray analysis revealed changes in expression ofRap1in 1/6gin both MHU 4 and MHU 5. Red in heat map indicates upregulated mRNA at 1/6gand green in heat map indicates downregulated mRNA at 1/6gcompared to the 1ggroup.(B)Immunofluorescence staining confirmed the upregulation of Rap1 in lunar gravity compared with ground control for both MHU 4 and MHU 5 missions. Scale bar: 50um.\n\nUpregulation ofRab2a,Rab10, andRab27in lunar gravity in both MHU 4 and MHU 5.(A)Heat map showing the ratio calculated from the signal intensity of 1/6g 1g.Microarray analysis revealed that changes in the expressionRab2a,Rab10, andRab27in 1/6gin both MHU 4 and MHU 5. Red in heat map indicates upregulated mRNA at 1/6gand green in heat map indicates downregulated mRNA at 1/6gcompared to the 1ggroup.(B)Immunofluorescence staining confirmed the upregulation of Rab2a, Rab10, and Rab27 in lunar gravity compared with ground control for both MHU 4 and MHU 5 missions. Scale bar: 50um.\n\nNo common upregulation ofRho,Sar/Arf, andRanfamily genes was observed in the lunar gravity groups of the MHU 4 and MHU 5 missions.(A C)Heat map showing the ratio calculated from the signal intensity on small G protein,Rho,Sar/Arf, andRanfamily of 1/6g 1g. Microarray analysis revealed no common upregulation ofRho,Sar/Arf, andRanfamily except forGEF/GAPin lunar gravity for both MHU 4 and MHU 5 missions. Red in heat map indicates upregulated mRNA at 1/6gand green in heat map indicates downregulated mRNA at 1/6gcompared to the 1ggroup.\n\nWe explored upstream signaling pathways, including Gs, Gi, or Gqprotein coupled receptors and their respective second messengers and enzyme related factors, as well as mRNA related to adrenergic receptors in the sympathetic nervous system and acetylcholine receptors in the parasympathetic nervous system. We observed no significant differences in mRNA expression of them between the samples of GC and PG in both the MHU 4 and MHU 5 missions (Figure 8A). In sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve functions, genes related to adrenergic and cholinergic receptors in the submandibular glands were not significantly upregulated in 1/6glunar gravity in both the MHU 4 and  5 groups (Figure 8B). Therefore, changes in mRNA expression may occur downstream signals of salivary secretion system involved in vesicular transport and secretion at apical side of acinar cells.\n\nNo common upregulation of GPCR, including Gs, Gi, or Gqproteins involved in salivary secretion, was observed.(A)Heat map showing the ratio calculated from the signal intensity of 1/6g 1g.Microarray analysis revealed no common upregulation of GPCR, including Gs, Gi, or Gq, involved in salivary secretion under the lunar gravity environment in MHU 4 and  5 missions.(B)There were no significant upregulation of autonomic nerve related receptor genes, including adrenergic and cholinergic receptors. Red in heat map indicates upregulated mRNA at 1/6gand green in heat map indicates downregulated mRNA at 1/6gcompared to the 1ggroup.\n\nGSEA results revealed that the gene set involved in oxidative phosphorylation were highly upregulated in submandibular gland samples under 1/6glunar gravity in MHU 4 and  5 (Figure 9A). In addition, the gene set involved in ion exchange associated with ATP synthesis was also upregulated at 1/6glunar gravity compared to that under 1gin the MHU 4 and  5 missions (Figure 9B).\n\nEnrichment in a set of mRNAs relating oxidative phosphorylation and ATP synthesis coupled electron transport was observed in lunar gravity in both MHU 4 and  5 missions.(A)Gene set enriched analysis (GSEA) revealed the activation of oxidative phosphorylation in lunar gravity for both MHU 4 and  5 missions.(B)GSEA also revealed the activation of ATP synthesis coupled electron transport in lunar gravity for both MHU 4 and  5 missions.\n\nWe then investigated whether mechanosensitive ion channels in the submandibular glands sense gravity induced fluid changes. The heat map shows ratio in changes in the mRNA expression of cation channels, especially transient receptor potential (TRP), Piezo, and acid sensing ion (ASIC) channels. We revealed mechanosensitive ion channel genes, such asTrpv2,Trpv4,Piezo1,Piezo2, andAsic3were downregulated in the 1/6ggroup compared with the 1ggroup in MHU 4 and  5 (Figure 10).\n\nDownregulation of mechanosensitive ion channels in lunar gravity.

    "discussion": "In the 1/6glunar gravitational environment,Amy1was upregulated in the submandibular glands, as wereVamp8and the small G proteinRap1(Rasfamily)/Rab2a,Rab10, andRab27(Rab family) which are involved in vesicle secretion. Amylase has been identified as a stress marker in behavioral medicine and space flight crews (Ali and Nater, 2020;Ghasemi et al., 2021).Vamp8acts as a v SNARE that regulates the secretion of the entire exocrine system (Wang et al., 2007). Salivary proteins are synthesized in acinar cells. Based on the genetic information in acinar cells, salivary proteins are synthesized in ribosomes, pass through the rough endoplasmic reticulum, become vesicles, and are transported to the Golgi apparatus. Intravesicular proteins that undergo modifications, such as glycosylation, in the Golgi apparatus are concentrated and stored in secretory granules. Small G proteins such as Ras and Rab families function salivary secretion, as guanosine triphosphate (GTP) binding proteins with a molecular weight of 20 30kDa. This hydrolysis results in inactive guanosine diphosphate (GDP). Small G proteins act as molecular switches that bind specific target molecules and transmit intracellular signals. GDP/GTP exchange proteins (GEF) are regulated by GTPase activating proteins (GAPs). The combined GTP and GDP states function as molecular switches corresponding to the on/off states. Activity regulation is temporally and spatially controlled and functions as a biotimer. Small G proteins are classified into five families, and regulate various cellular functions.Rap/Rabsignaling plays an important role in saliva and amylase secretion (D'Silva et al., 1998;Sabbatini et al., 2008;Gomi et al., 2017). Our study showed no increase in the expression of mRNA related to receptors for noradrenaline secreted from sympathetic nerves involved in protein secretion, where is the upstream of salivary secretion system, while upregulations of Rap/Rab signaling for transporting intracellular vesicles and v SNARE (Vamp8) to secrete amylase via exocytosis at apical side of acinar cells were observed in the 1/6genvironment.\n\nIn addition, salivary secretion requires high levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) not only for salivary secretion by maintaining intracellular K+concentration in acinar cells, but also for modification of saliva by reabsorption and secretion in ductal cells of submandibular gland. Our GSEA data show that a set of mRNAs involved in oxidative phosphorylation was highly upregulated under 1/6glunar gravity in MHU 4 and  5. Plus, mRNAs in association of ionic transport coupled with ATP synthesis or hydrolysis were also upregulated at 1/6glunar gravity compared to that under 1gin the MHU 4 and  5 missions. We also hypothesized that changes in gravity may induce changes in body fluids, resulting in excessive fluid inflow into the submandibular gland. Our data shows downregulation of mechanosensitive ion channels such asTRP,Piezo, andASICchannels, however. Fluid balance fluctuates when gravity changes, shifting fluid to the upper body and creating a situation where the astronauts have edema around the salivary glands, which causes mechanical stress. It is possible that the mRNA levels of these mechanosensitive ion channels in the submandibular gland decrease because of a function that restores them to their normal state.\n\nIn conclusion, our results indicate that changes in the gravitational environment induce qualitative changes in salivary secretion function and that multiple genes may be involved in maintaining salivary secretion homeostasis in the space environment. Overall, our data suggested that lunar gravity upregulates salivary amylase secretion via vesicular transport and exocytosis mediated by Rap/Rab signaling and Vamp8 at apical side of acinar cells (Figure 11). However, we have not shown the functional assay as amylase secretion in this study. To clarify the correlation mechanisms between these mRNAs and amylase secretion, it will need to be verified whether any effect on amylase secretion is caused by both gain of function and loss of function experiments in acinar cells. Further research on salivary secretion signal and gene regulation may contribute to the future monitoring of the physical and mental health of humans living in space as well as the improvement of oral medicine.\n\nUpregulation of salivary amylase secretion via Rap/Rab signaling and exocytosis via Vamp8 under the lunar gravity.(A)Graphical scheme shows signaling pathway for salivary secretion in acinar cells.
