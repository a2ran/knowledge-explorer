    "abstract": "Root gravitropism relies on gravity perception by the root cap and requires tightly regulated phytohormone signaling. Here, we isolate a rice mutant that displays root coiling in hydroponics but normal gravitropic growth in soil. We identifyCOILING ROOT IN WATER 1(CRW1) encoding an ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3) BINDING F BOX PROTEIN (OsEBF1) as the causative gene for the mutant phenotype. We show that the OsCRW1 EIN3 LIKE 1 and 2 (OsEIL1/2) ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR 82 (OsERF82) module controls the production of reactive oxygen species in the root tip, subsequently impacting root cap stability, polar localization of PIN FORMED 2 (OsPIN2), symmetric distribution of auxin, and ultimately gravitropic growth of roots. The OsEIL1/2 OsERF82 ethylene signaling module is effectively impeded by applying gentle mechanical resistance to root tips, including growing in water saturated paddy soil. We further show that mechanosensing induced calcium signaling is required and sufficient for antagonizing the ethylene signaling pathway. This study has revealed previously unanticipated interplay among ethylene, auxin, and mechanosensing in the control of plant gravitropism.\n\nSubject terms:Plant signalling, Tropism, Plant hormones",
    "methods": "The japonica rice cultivar Zhonghua11 was used as the wild type (WT) for all experiments. An ethyl methylsulfonate (EMS) mutagenized population (M3 generation) was used for root phenotype screening. Transgenic plant materials were generated as described below. Seeds were surface sterilized with 15% NaClO for 30min, washed with sterilized water, and placed in a 37  degreesC incubator for 2 days to promote germination. Germinated seeds were transferred to hydroponic boxes, soil culture boxes or agar plates to grow depending on the requirements of different experiments. Experiments were carried out in a growth room with the following conditions: temperature 28  degreesC +/  0.5  degreesC, humidity 50% 60%, 12 h photoperiod with a light intensity of 100mmol of photons m 2s 1. WT and mutant were also grown in two paddy fields (Nanjing and Sanya) to maturity. Agronomic traits, including plant height, tiller number, percentage of filled grains, 1000 grain weight and grain biomass per plant, were determined at plant maturity.\n\nThe CRISPR/Cas9 system63was used to knock outOsCRW1(Os06g0605900) andOsEBF2(Os02g0200900) in the Zhonghua11 background andOsEBF2,OsEIL1(Os03g0324200),OsEIL2(Os07g0685700),OsERF2(Os06g0181700),OsERF81(Os02g0520000), andOsERF82(Os04g0399800) in thecrw1background. Two 20 bp target sequences were selected from the coding sequence (CDS) of each gene and cloned into two single guide RNA (sgRNA) expression cassettes ofpYLgRNA OsU6aandpYLgRNA OsU6bby overlapping PCR, producingproU6a T1 sgRNAandproU6b T2 sgRNAfragments, respectively. The two fragments were sequentially cloned into the BsaI site of thepYLCRISPR Cas9Pubi Hvector to generate the ultimate plasmids. To generate the complementation constructs ofproOsCRW1::OsCRW1,proOs06g0604400:: Os06g0604400andproOs06g0619600::Os06g0619600, we amplified the promoter (1739bp ofproOsCRW1, 3 Kb ofproOs06g0604400and 3 Kb ofproOs06g0619600) and the open reading frame (ORF) ofOsCRW1,Os06g0604400andOs06g0619600from the DNA of Zhonghua11. The promoter and ORF were cloned together by overlapping PCR and introduced into the EcoRI/XbaI site of thepCAMBIAL1301vector. To generateproOsCRW1::GFPconstructs, we amplified the promoter ofOsCRW1(1739bp) from the DNA of Zhonghua11and the GFP sequence from thepUN1301vector with addition of the initiation codon. The promoter and GFP sequence were cloned together by overlapping PCR and introduced into the HindIII/SacI site of thepUN1301vector. To generatepOsCRW1::GUSconstructs, we amplified the promoter ofOsCRW1(1739bp) from the DNA of Zhonghua11 and introducedOsCRW1promoter into the HindIII/BamHI site of thep1300vector. To generateproOsEIL1::OsEIL1 FlagandproOsEIL2::OsEIL2 Flagconstructs, we amplified the promoter (2588bp ofproOsEIL1, 2500bp ofproOsEIL2) and the full length CDS (without the stop codon) ofOsEIL1andOsEIL2from the DNA and cDNA of Zhonghua11. The promoter and CDS were cloned together by overlapping PCR and introduced into the BamHI/SpeI site of thepTCK303vector. To generateproUbi::OsEIL1(OsEIL1 OX) andproUbi::OsEIL2(OsEIL2 OX) constructs, we amplified the full length CDS ofOsEIL1andOsEIL2from the cDNA of cv. ZH11 and introduced the CDS segments into the BamHI/SacI site of thepUN1301vector. The plasmids were transformed into the callus of Zhonghua11 orcrw1usingAgrobacterium mediated transformation64. Transformants were verified by PCR. All primers used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table1.\n\nZhonghua11 expressingDR5rev::VENUS65,proOsPIN2::OsPIN2 GFP14, orNES YC3.665were obtained from previous studies. These genotypes and Zhonghua11 expressingproOsEIL1::OsEIL1 FlagorproOsEIL2::OsEIL2 Flagwere crossed withcrw1oroscrw1KOlines (maternal) to obtain the reporter or tag lines in the mutant background by PCR. The F3 seeds were used for experiments.\n\nGerminated seeds were placed on a net floating on deionized water for ten days and then transferred to  strength Kimura B nutrient solution66for different durations according to the requirements of experiments. The nutrient solution was changed every three days, and the pH was maintained at 5.6 5.8. To investigate the effects of nutrients, pH, light and dissolved oxygen level on root phenotypes, we grew seedlings ofcrw1and WT in hydroponic boxes filled with deionized water or nutrient solution at the  and  strength, different solution pH (from 4 to 8), light condition (12h/12h light/dark or 24h dark), with or without aeration treatment (dissolved oxygen level 12.45 and 5.36mg/L, respectively). To compare the root phenotypes grown in water and solid media, we grew germinated seedlings in water (pH = 5.6 5.8), water saturated paddy soil, water saturated vermiculite or water saturated peat pellet for 2 10 days. Dissolved oxygen concentrations in hydroponic solution and soil were measured using a dissolved oxygen probe. In some experiments, paddy soil was packed at a normal (1.0gcm 3) and a high (1.6gcm 3) bulk density. The penetration resistance of soil and other solid growth media was measured by using a soil compactness tester.\n\nTo investigate the effect of mechanical resistance on root phenotypes, we grew seedlings of WT andcrw1in agar solidified medium with 0.3, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0 or 1.2% (w/v) agar in square Petri dishes. The top 2 cm agar was removed and the emerged seminal roots (1 2mm) of WT andcrw1were embedded in the agar and allowed to grow vertically for 2 to 3 days. To apply resistance on root tips, we made polystyrene foam spherical pellets (1mm diameter) with a slit in the middle, placed root tip into the slit and grew seedlings in deionized water for 2 3 days. For chemical treatment, L Kynurenine (L Kyn, 10uM), 1 Methylcyclopropene (1 MCP, 10uM), 1 Aminocyclopropanecarboxylic Acid (ACC, 1uM), N acetylcysteine (NAC, 200uM), diphenyleneiodonium (DPI, 50nM), salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM, 10uM) or LaCl3(100uM) were added to deionized water or agar medium according to different experiments. Each genotype and treatment had at least 3 biological replicates, 7 12 plants per replicate in short term hydroponic experiments, 3 6 plants per replicate in long term hydroponic experiments, 3 4 plants per replicate in petri dish experiments, and 7 12 plants per replicate in soil vermiculite experiments.\n\nTo clone the causal gene responsible for the coiling root phenotype ofcrw1, we backcrossedcrw1to WT (Zhonghua11) to generate F1progenies. F1progenies were selfed to generate F2progenies. DNA was extracted from 50 F2plants showing the coiling root phenotype in water and mixed in equal proportions to generate a pooled genomic DNA ofcrw1. A pooled genomic DNA of WT was prepared in the same way. Genome sequencing was performed using Illumina Hiseq4000 at 50x and 30x coverage forcrw1and WT, respectively), generating 150 bp paired end reads. After removing the adapter sequences and low quality reads, clean reads were mapped to the reference genome sequence (OsNipponbare Reference RGAP7, MSU) using BWA software67, followed by SNP calling using GATK software68. Causative variant were calculated using the MutMap SNP index method69and candidate SNPs were identified.\n\nTransgenic rice plants expressingproOsCRW1::GUSwere grown in water for 3 days before being used for histochemical staining for the GUS activity in roots, and in nutrient solution for different durations for GUS staining of leaves and reproductive organs. Roots and other tissues were incubated with a GUS staining solution for 2h at 37 degreesC, transferred to 70% ethanol overnight, and then photographed under an ultra depth stereoscopic microscope (Leica, DVM6a). Transgenic rice plants expressingproOsCRW1::GFPwere grown in water for 3 days and roots were cut and were placed on a slide for fluorescence imaging under a macro zoom microscope (Carl Zeiss, MVX10). The GFP fluorescence was observed at 505 560nm for emission and 488nm for excitation.\n\nTo generate constructs ofGFP OsCRW1orGFP OsERF82driven by the CaMV35S promoter (pro35S::GFP OsCRW1orpro35S::GFP OsERF82), we amplified the full length CDS ofOsCRW1orOsERF82from the cDNA of Zhonghua11 and introduced the CDS into the HindIII/EcoRI site of thepSAT6 GFP Cvector. The fragments ofpro35S::GFP OsCRW1orpro35S::GFP OsERF82were isolated from thepSAT6 GFP Cvector by PI PspI endonuclease and introduced into the PI PspI site of thepRCS2vector. The plasmids were transformed into rice protoplasts for transient expression70. Protoplasts were isolated from rice stems and labeled with the nucleus marker 4',6 diamidino 2 phenylindole (DAPI) for co localization. The GFP and DAPI fluorescence was observed under a confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, LSM780) at 505 560nm and 400 470nm for emission, respectively, and at 488nm and 360nm for excitation, respectively.\n\nRoot tips from two day old seedlings were cut and stained with 0.1% (w/v) basic fuchsin solution for 6h. Root tips were resin embedded, sectioned according to a previous method71, and photographed under a microscope to reveal the root cap size. Root tips from two day old seedlings were cut, stained with 5% (v/v) Lugol's solution for 1minute, washed with distilled water, and photographed under a microscope for the observation of the amyloplasts in the root caps. Lugol's stock solution was prepared by dissolving 5% (m/v) iodine in 10% (m/v) KI solution.\n\nPlants expressingproOsPIN2::OsPIN2 GFPor the reporter gene for auxin response (DR5rev::VENUS) or for cytosolic Ca2+(NES YC3.6, driven by the maizeUbiquitinpromoter) were grown under different growth conditions or treatments for two to three days. Root tips were cut and immediately observed under a confocal laser scanning microscope. The GFP fluorescence was observed as described above. The VENUS fluorescence was observed at 520 550nm for emission and 515nm for excitation. For NES YC3.6 detection, the measurement of cpVENUS/ECFP ratio shifts was based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer according to a previous method50. The ECFP fluorescence was observed at 460 490nm for emission and 415nm for excitation. For detection of ROS, roots were incubated with 10uM H2DCFDA for 10mins, washed with deionized water, and the ROS fluorescence was observed under a confocal laser scanning microscope at 505 560nm and 488nm for emission and excitation, respectively65.\n\nThe TUNEL assay was used to detect the programed cell death of root caps. Root tips were sampled and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30mins, followed by washing with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Root tips were immersed in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X 100 for 5mins, washed with PBS, and incubated in the TUNEL detection solution (Beyotime, China) at 37  degreesC for 1h. The TUNEL fluorescence was observed under a confocal laser scanning microscope at 515 565nm and 488nm for emission and excitation, respectively.\n\nThe Y2H assay was used to detect the interaction between OsCRW1 and OsEIL1 or OsEIL2.The full length CDS ofOsCRW1was introduced into the EcoRI/BamHI site of thepGBKT7vector to generate thepGBKT7 OsCRW1vector expressing fusion proteins containing the yeast GAL4 transcription binding domain (BD). The full length CDS ofOsEIL1orOsEIL2was introduced into the EcoRI/BamHI site ofpGADT7to generate thepGADT7 OsEIL1andpGADT7 EIL2vector expressing fusion proteins containing the yeast GAL4 transcription activation domain (AD). ThepGBKT7 OsCRW1plasmid andpGADT7 OsEIL1orpGADT7 OsEIL2plasmid were transformed into the Y2H Gold yeast strain alone or in pairs.pGBKT7 53together withpGADT7 Twere transformed as a positive control, andpGBKT7 lamtogether withpGADT7 Twere transformed as a negative control. The yeast colonies were cultured in Synthetic Dropout (SD) liquid medium ( Trp,  Leu) to an optical density (OD) of 0.8. The serially diluted yeast solution was inoculated on a double deficient SD medium ( Trp,  Leu) and a quadruple deficient SD medium ( Trp,  Leu,  His,  Ade, +X alpha gal) for growth.\n\nThe full length CDS ofOsCRW1was fused to the vector ofpDONR221 P3P2, and the full length CDS ofOsEIL1andOsEIL2were fused to the vector ofpDONR221 P1P4by gateway cloning, and then were transferred intopBiFCt 2in1 NNvector alone or in pairs by LR clonase to fuse with the N  and C terminal fragments of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). The final plasmids were introduced intoAgrobacterium tumefaciensstrain GV3101. Bacterial cultures of the test combinations and controls were infiltrated into tobacco (Latin name) leaves. Two days after infiltration, the YFP signal was detected under confocal laser microscopy at 520 550nm and 515nm for emission and excitation, respectively.\n\nFor immunological detection of OsEIL1 Flag, OsEIL2 Flag and OsActin in the roots of WT andcrw1, total soluble proteins were extracted from 15 20 seminal roots with 1ml plant protein extraction buffer. Proteins were denatured by heating at 95oC for 10min in a metal bath and separated on 12% SDS PAGE. Subsequently, proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane and immunoblots were probed with the following antibodies in the TBST solution (100mM Tris HCl, 150mM NaCl, 0.1%(v/v) Tween 20, pH=7.4) with 5% non fat dry milk. A mouse anti Flag antibody (Invitrogen, MA1 91878, 1:5000 dilution) and a mouse anti Actin antibody (Beyotime, AA128, 1:5000 dilution) were used as the primary antibodies and HPR conjugated goat anti mouse IgG (Beyotime, A0216, 1:5000 dilution) was used as the secondary antibody. Chemiluminescence was performed using ECL Western Blotting Substrate (Beyotime, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\nThe full length CDS ofOsEIL1,OsEIL2orOsERF82was introduced into the EcoRI/BamHI site of thepGADT7vector to express fusion proteins containing the yeast GAL4 transcription activation domain. To detect the binding of OsEIL1/2 with the EIN3 binding site (EBS, ATGTA) on the promoter ofOsERF82, we introduced three copies of EBS into the SmaI/SalI site of thepAbAivector. A random mutation sequence in EBS was designed (EBSmut, CGAGA) and used as a negative control. To detect the binding of OsERF82 with the GCC box (GCCGCC), G box (CACGTG) and DRE/CRT (GCCGAC) on the promoter sequence ofOsRBOHHand three Class IIIOsPRXgenes, we introduced three copies of DRE/CRT, GCC box and G box sequence into the SmaI/SalI site of thepAbAivector. A random mutation sequence in each potential binding site was designed (GCC boxmut, ACCACC; G boxmut, AACTTG; DRE/CRTmut, GTCGAA) and used as a negative control.pAbAicarrying different binding sites were transformed into Y1H Gold yeast strain to screen the proper concentration of aureobasidin A (AbA) for inhibiting transcriptional self activation.pGADT7carryingOsEIL1orOsEIL2orOsERF82, andpAbAicarrying different sequences were co transformed into Y1H Gold yeast strain. The yeast colonies were cultured in Leu deficient SD liquid medium to OD of 0.8. The serially diluted yeast solution was inoculated on Leu deficient SD medium (with or without AbA) for growth.\n\nThe full length CDS ofOsEIL1,OsEIL2orOsERF82were introduced into the NdeI/XhoI site of thepET29avector and transformed intoEscherichia coliBL21 to express OsEIL1 His, OsEIL2 His or OsERF82 His fusion protein. OsEIL1 His, OsEIL2 His and OsERF82 His fusion proteins were purified fromE. coliby nickel affinity columns. Primers were designed for the EIN3 binding site (EBS, ATGTA) on the promoter sequence ofOsERF82or designed for the ERF binding sites including the GCC box, the G box and the DRE/CRT sequence on the promoter sequence ofOsRBOHHand three Class IIIOsPRXgenes to synthesize biotin labeled probes, unlabeled probes, and unlabeled mutation probes. The protein and probe were incubated with EMSA reaction solution (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol, Beyotime, China) for 20min at room temperature, separated on a 5% polyacrylamide native gel at 4 degreesC, and transferred to a nylon membrane. After UV light cross linking, the DNA on the membrane was detected using the Chemiluminescent Nucleic Acid Detection Module. Primers used are listed in Supplementary Table2.\n\nThe ChIP assay was performed using the BeyoChIP ChIP Assay Kit (Beyotime, P2080S, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plants ofpOsEIL2::OsEIL2 Flag/crw1andpOsEIL2::OsEIL2 Flag/crw1were grown in water for two day, and 15 20 roots were collected as one biological replicate, with three biological replicates for each experiment. Root tissue was cross linked in 1% (v/v) formaldehyde under vacuum. Chromatin was extracted from the samples and fragmented via ultrasound treatment to a size of 200 500bp, and 2% of the yield was set aside as input template. The OsEIL1 DNA and OsEIL2 DNA complex were coimmunoprecipitated with anti Flag antibody (Invitrogen, MA1 91878, 1:5000 dilution) and protein A/G beads (Beyotime, P2080S, China), or coimmunoprecipitated with IgG (Beyotime, A7028, China) with protein A/G beads. NaCl (0.2M) was added to the solution of protein DNA complex and heated at 65  degreesC for 4hours to remove the cross linking between protein and genomic DNA. According to the manufacturer's instructions, DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform agent for DNA purification (Solarbio, T0250, China). Primers (Supplementary Table3) were designed near the three EBS sequences on theOsERF82promoter. Primers and purified DNA were used for ChIP qPCR.\n\nThe full length CDS ofOsERF82was introduced into the EcoRI/BamHI site of thepGBKT7vector to generate thepGBKT7 OsCRW1vector expressing fusion protein containing the yeast GAL4 transcription binding domain (BD). ThepGBKT7 OsERF82plasmid was transformed into the AH109 yeast strain.pGBKT7plasmid was transformed as a negative control. The yeast colonies were cultured in Synthetic Dropout (SD) liquid medium ( Trp) to OD=0.8. The serially diluted yeast solution was inoculated on Trp deficient SD medium and double deficient SD medium ( Trp,  His, +X alpha gal) for growth.\n\nRNA sequencing was performed on roots ofcrw1and WT grown in water or in a soil vermiculite mixture for two days. Each group contained three replicates with 15 20 plants per replicate. Total RNA was extracted using a Plant Total RNA Extraction Kit (BioTeke). The cDNA libraries were sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencing platform at Benagen Technology (Wuhan, China), and 150 bp paired end reads were generated. For the analysis of gene expression, fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads and read counts of each unigene were calculated and normalized based on the number of uniquely positioned reads overlapping the exon regions. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using R software (v.3.5.1) with the DESeq2 package (http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html).\n\nTotal RNA was extracted using a Plant Total RNA Extraction Kit (BioTeke, Beijing, China). A HiScript II 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Vazyme, Nanjing, China) was used to convert 1ug of total RNA to 20uL cDNA. Quantitative real time PCR was performed on an RT PCR detection system (CFX96, Bio Rad) by using SYBR Green Master Mix (Vazyme, Nanjing, China).OsActinandOsHistonewere used as the internal reference genes. The expression levels were calculated using the equation 2 (Ct). Primers are shown in Supplementary Table3.\n\nThe experiments performed in this study were repeated independently at least three times with similar results. The data are presented as the mean+/ SD and the microscope images presented are the most representative of the results. The significance of the difference between two sets of data was tested by one  or two sided Student's t test using Microsoft Excel 2019. The difference among more than two sets of data was analyzed by one way or two way ANOVA followed by Tukey's test as post hoc analysis using IBM SPSS Statistics 21.0. No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size. No data were excluded from the analyses. The experiments were not randomized. The Investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.\n\nFurther information on research design is available in theNature Portfolio Reporting Summarylinked to this article.",
    "results": "We screened an ethyl methylsulfonate mutagenized population (approximately 5000 lines) of the rice (Oryza sativaL.) cultivar Zhonghua11 and isolated a mutant with root coiling phenotype when grown in hydroponic culture (Fig.1a, Supplementary Movie1). Both seminal and adventitious roots of the mutant coiled in the root tip region, resulting in a shorter root depth compared to the wild type (WT, Supplementary Fig.1). Changes in nutrient supply, solution pH, aeration (dissolved oxygen level), and exposure to light did not alter the root coiling phenotype of the mutant in hydroponic culture (Supplementary Fig.2). When grown in water saturated solid media (e.g. paddy soil, soil vermiculite mixture, vermiculite and peat pellet), however, the root coiling phenotype disappeared (Fig.1aand Supplementary Fig.3). We named the mutantcoiling root in water(crw1).\n\na dSeedlings of WT andcrw1were grown in water or soil for 2 days.aRoot phenotypes.bRoot caps.cLugol's staining of amyloplast.d,eResponses of WT andcrw1roots to gravity stimulation. Seedlings of WT andcrw1were grown in water or soil for 1 day, and roots were placed horizontally for another 9 hour growth.dRoot phenotypes.eGrowth angle of root tip at 9h. The direction of each root tip was measured as the absolute value toward the direction of gravity. The frequency was calculated as the proportion of root number that fell within 15 degrees to the total number of analyzed roots for WT andcrw1.f,gAuxin distribution of root tips indicated by expressing DR5rev::VENUS (green fluorescence).fWT andcrw1grow in water or soil for two days.gWhen growing in water, the auxin ofcrw1root tips is consistently asymmetrically distributed. The red fluorescence of propidium iodide (PI) indicates cell wall. White dashes outline the root tip ofcrw1and the white arrow with g indicates the direction of gravity.hLocalization of OsPIN2 GFP of epidermis at 1mm from the root tip focusing on the left (L), middle (M) or right (R) side of the root. WT and crw1 expressing proOsPIN2::OsPIN2 GFP grew in water or soil for two days. Scale bars are 1cm in (a,d), 100 um in (b, c, f, g) and 20 um in (h). Data and images shown are representative results of three independent experiments with similar results. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.\n\nIn contrast to the distinctive root phenotype, shoots ofcrw1grew normally in hydroponics (Supplementary Fig.4a, b). Plants were grown to maturity in two paddy fields. In one paddy field, no significant difference was observed betweencrw1and WT in any of the agronomic traits determined at plant maturity (Supplementary Fig.4c h), whereas in the other field there was a small and significant reduction in the percentage of filled grains and grain biomass per plant incrw1compared with WT (Supplementary Fig.4i n).\n\nThe coiling phenotype ofcrw1suggests that it may be a gravitropic mutant. Compared with WT,crw1had a smaller root cap (Fig.1b) and fewer amyloplasts in the root tip (Fig.1c). When roots were placed horizontally,crw1responded less sensitively to gravity than WT and started to coil at 6h after horizontal placement (Fig.1d, eand Supplementary Fig.5), indicating impaired gravitropic response.\n\nAuxin distribution is crucial for root gravitropism11. To examine the auxin distribution in the root tip, we introduced the auxin reporterDR5rev::VENUSinto WT andcrw1. When grown in water (Fig.1g), WT roots showed symmetrical auxin distribution, whereascrw1showed asymmetric auxin distribution at different stages of coiling (Fig.1g). When WT roots were placed horizontally, gravity triggered rapid accumulation of auxin on the bottom side of the root tip, causing it to grow towards the gravity direction; once the root tip grew in the gravity direction, symmetrical auxin distribution was restored (Supplementary Fig.6a). In contrast,crw1exhibited an asymmetric auxin distribution at all stages under gravitational stimulation (Supplementary Fig.6b). As expected, asymmetric auxin distribution led to asymmetric cell length on the two sides of the root tip (Supplementary Fig.7a c). Compared to WT,crw1had a shorter meristem and fewer meristem cells (Supplementary Fig.7d, e). Staining with 5 ethynyl 2 deoxyuridine (EdU) showed a lower proliferation of meristem cells incrw1than WT (Supplementary Fig.7f, g). Applying the auxin biosynthesis inhibitor L Kynurenine (L Kyn) or removing the root cap resulted in a more even auxin distribution (indicated byDR5rev::VENUS) and rescued the root coiling phenotype ofcrw1(Supplementary Fig.8).\n\nInArabidopsis thaliana, symmetrical auxin distribution in the root tip is maintained by the auxin exporter PIN2, which is polarly localized on the top of the root epidermal cells to allow the shootward flow of auxin from the root tip12. This pattern of polar localization is conserved in seed plants3. To examine the localization of OsPIN2 in the root tip, we introducedOsPIN2 GFPdriven by its native promoter (pOsPIN2::OsPIN2 GFP) into WT andcrw1by crossing. OsPIN2 GFP was polarly localized in the epidermal cells in WT, whereas such polarity was lost incrw1(Fig.1h), which is consistent with the asymmetric auxin distribution observed incrw1root tips.\n\nWhen grown in soil, all phenotypes of the mutant, including root coiling, root cap size, OsPIN2 polar localization, auxin distribution, and gravity response, were rescued to similar levels observed in WT (Fig.1a hand Supplementary Fig.5). Taken together, these data suggest that the root coiling phenotype ofcrw1in water is caused by a smaller root cap size with fewer amyloplasts and asymmetric auxin distribution resulted from OsPIN2 mis localization.\n\nTo clone the causal gene for thecrw1phenotype, we backcrossed WT (paternal) withcrw1(maternal). All F1plants showed the straight root phenotype in water (Supplementary Fig.9a), and the F2progeny segregated into 340 and 119 straight and coiling root, respectively, which is consistent with a 3:1 ratio (2=0.002,P=0.966) (Supplementary Fig.9b), indicating that the root coiling phenotype ofcrw1resulted from recessive mutation of a single gene. We conducted genomic resequencing mapping and Mut Map analysis on the F2progeny and identified three candidate genes,Os06g0604400,Os06g0605900, andOs06g0619600(Supplementary Fig.9c, d). Complementation tests identifiedOs06g0605900as the causative gene for the mutant phenotype, which we nameCOILING ROOT IN WATER 1 (OsCRW1)(Fig.2a dand Supplementary Fig.9e, f). Compared to WT, a 3681 bp fragment deletion was identified in the promoter and a portion of the open reading frame ofcrw1allele, resulting in a total loss of transcription (Fig.2a, b). CRISPR/Cas9 mediated knockout ofOsCRW1(oscrw1KO) in WT also generated the same root coiling phenotype in water, which disappeared in soil (Fig.2e, fand Supplementary Fig.10a). The threeoscrw1KOlines also showed smaller root caps and asymmetric auxin distribution in the root tips when grown in water, and these defective phenotypes were rescued when plants were grown in soil (Supplementary Fig.10b, c).\n\naA 3681 bp deletion occurred in the upstream and coding sequence ofOsCRW1incrw1.bOsCRW1transcript in WT,crw1andOsCRW1COM/crw1complementation lines.OsHistoneandOsActinwere used as the internal reference genes.c,dWT,crw1andOsCRW1COM/crw1seedlings were grown in water for 2 days.cRoot phenotypes.dRoot depth.e,fWT,crw1andOsCRW1knockout (oscrw1KO, in WT background) lines were grown in water for 2 days.eRoot phenotypes.fRoot depth.g,hTissue expression pattern ofOsCRW1in the root tip of transgenic plants expressingproOsCRW1::GFPorproOsCRW1::GUS.iSubcellular localization of OsCRW1 detected by expressingpro35S::GFPorpro35S::GFP OsCRW1in rice protoplasts transiently.

In roots,OsCRW1was strongly expressed in root tips, especially in the root cap (Fig.2g, h). Transient expression ofp35S::GFP OsCRW1in rice protoplasts showed that OsCRW1 was localized in the nucleus (Fig.2i).\n\nOsCRW1encodes an F box domain containing protein (OsEBF1), a homolog of theArabidopsisEIN3 binding F box protein 1 (AtEBF1)27,28. Recent studies showed that OsEBF1 and OsEBF2 negatively control ethylene signaling like AtEBF1 and AtEBF238, and loss of function of OsEBF1 or OsEBF2 led to a hypersensitivity of root and coleoptile to exogenous ethylene38, and a decreased resistance to brown planthopper in rice39,40. To examine whether loss of function ofOsEBF2affects gravitropism, we knocked outOsEBF2in the WT background using CRISPR/Cas9. No effect on root growth and gravitropism was found (Supplementary Fig.12a, b). Knockout ofOsEBF2incrw1did not exacerbate the root coiling phenotype in water, and also did not affect the phenotype recovery in soil (Supplementary Fig.12c, d), suggesting that OsEBF2, unlike OsCRW1/OsEBF1, does not play a role in root gravitropism.\n\nWe performed RNA seq analysis on WT andcrw1roots grown in water or soil. Among the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) betweencrw1and WT grown in water, ethylene responsive genes were strongly enriched, with 30 of the 32 DEGs being significantly upregulated incrw1, including 20 ethylene response transcription factors (ERFs) (Fig.3a, b). When grown in soil, the number of DEGs betweencrw1and WT decreased to 5, with 2 ethylene related genes being upregulated incrw1compared with WT (Supplementary Fig.13). Application of 1 MCP, an ethylene response inhibitor, totally rescued the phenotypes of smaller root cap, asymmetric auxin distribution and root coiling incrw1and threeoscrw1KOlines in water (Fig.3c f), suggesting that excessive ethylene response leads to the root coiling phenotype.\n\na,bGene oncology pathway enrichment of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) betweencrw1and WT roots.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.\n\nThe above findings support the notion that OsCRW1/OsEBF1 may, likeArabidopsisAtEBF1, function in the degradation of core ethylene response transcription factors27,28. These may include OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 that are rice homologs of AtEIN3/EIL1 (Supplementary Fig.14a), the central transcriptional factors controlling the activation of ethylene signaling and targets of AtEBF141,42. We investigated whether OsCRW1 interacts with OsEIL1/OsEIL2 proteins. Yeast two hybrid (Y2H) and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays showed that OsCRW1 physically interacted with OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 (Supplementary Fig.14b, c). We generated transgenic plants expressingpOsEIL1::OsEIL1 FlagorpOsEIL2::OsEIL2 Flagin WT, and introduced these transgenes intocrw1by crossing. Western blot showed thatcrw1roots accumulated much higher levels of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 than WT when grown in water, but the differences largely disappeared when grown in soil (Fig.4a, b). WT roots grown in water, submerged paddy soil, vermiculite or soil vermiculite mixture showed similarly low levels of OsEIL1 (Supplementary Fig.15), indicative of similar levels of ethylene in these media. In contrast, WT roots grown in a highly compacted soil (bulk density = 1.6gcm 3) exhibited an elevated level of OsEIL1, indicating an increased ethylene consistent with the report by Pandey et al.30Next, we knocked outOsEIL1(oseil1KO/crw1) orOsEIL2(oseil2KO/crw1) incrw1by using CRISPR/Cas9 (Supplementary Fig.14d, e), which essentially rescued the root coiling phenotype ofcrw1in water (Fig.4c, d), with the effect being greater inoseil1KO/crw1than inoseil2KO/crw1. These results indicate that loss of function of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 leads to overaccumulation of both OsEIL1 and OsEIL2, causing the root coiling phenotype in water, with OsEIL1 playing a larger role than OsEIL2.\n\na,bImmunoblot analysis of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 proteins in roots.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.\n\nNext, we overexpressedOsEIL1orOsEIL2driven by the maizeUbiquitinpromoter, increasing the transcription of the two genes by 16 22  and 52 57 fold, respectively (Supplementary Fig.16a, b). When grown in water,OsEIL1andOsEIL2overexpressing lines showed shorter and slightly curved roots compared with WT (Supplementary Fig.16c). Addition of a small dose of the ethylene precursor ACC (1uM) in water decreased root growth of WT slightly but causedOsEIL1andOsEIL2overexpressing lines to coil in the root tip region, a phenotype resemblingcrw1(Supplementary Fig.16d). Overexpression ofOsEIL1orOsEIL2alone did not cause root coiling, likely because OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 is degraded in the presence of functional OsCRW1/OsEBF1. In contrast, enhanced ethylene concentration from ACC addition may repress the translation of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 and thus stabilize OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 proteins, as has been shown inArabidopsis43. When grown in soil, the shorter and curvy roots ofOsEIL1andOsEIL2overexpressing lines were largely rescued (Supplementary Fig.16e).\n\nTo search for the direct target genes downstream of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 that cause root coiling incrw1, we analyzed the expression pattern of all of the 139ERFgenes from the transcriptomic data. We expected that the transcriptional levels of the target genes should match the phenotype changes, i.e. elevated incrw1only in water but reduced in soil. When grown in water, 20ERFgenes were expressed at higher levels incrw1roots than WT (Supplementary Fig.17a). When grown in soil, 17 of these 20ERFgenes were equally highly expressed in both WT andcrw1(Supplementary Fig.17b), suggesting that these 17ERFgenes may not be related to the root coiling phenotype ofcrw1. The three remainingERFgenes,OsERF2(Os06g0181700),OsERF81(Os02g0520000) andOsERF82(Os04g0399800) were significantly downregulated in both WT andcrw1when grown in soil (Supplementary Fig.17b). TheseERFgenes are potential candidate genes targeted by OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 and associated with the occurrence of the root coiling phenotype (Supplementary Fig.17b, cand Fig.4e). We used CRISPR/Cas9 to knock out the threeERFgenes individually in thecrw1background (Supplementary Fig.17d f) and found that disruption ofOsERF82(oserf82KO/crw1) rescued the root coiling phenotype ofcrw1in water to a large extent (Fig.4f, g), whereas knockout ofOsERF2orOsERF81had no effect (Supplementary Fig.17g, h). The OsERF82 protein was localized in the nucleus and exhibited transactivation activity (Supplementary Fig.18a, b). We used yeast one hybrid (Y1H) and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) to demonstrate that OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 could specifically bind to the EIN3 binding sites (EBS, ATGTA) in the promoter region (2.5 Kb) ofOsERF82(Fig.4h jand Supplementary Fig.18c). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) qPCR ofpOsEIL1::OsEIL1 Flag/crw1andpOsEIL2::OsEIL2 Flag/crw1transgenic plants showed that OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 bound to the EBS sequences in the OsERF82 promoter in vivo (Fig.4k, l). Furthermore, knockout ofOsEIL1orOsEIL2incrw1largely abolished the upregulation ofOsERF82expression when grown in water (Fig.4m). Taken together, the transcription factor OsERF82 acts as a direct target of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 to amplify ethylene signaling and cause root coiling ofcrw1in water. The complete rescue of thecrw1phenotype inoseil1/crw1but the incomplete rescue inoserf82KO/crw1suggests that other target genes regulated by OsEIL1 may also be involved.\n\nIn addition to the ethylene signaling pathway, RNA seq showed that genes related to production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were also enriched incrw1when grown in water but not in soil (Fig.3aand Supplementary Fig.19a), suggesting that ROS may be involved in the root coiling phenotype. Among the DEGs betweencrw1and WT, a ROS responsive geneBsr d1/ZFP36, a respiratory burst oxidase homolog enzyme gene (RBOHH) and four class III peroxidase genes were upregulated incrw1(Supplementary Fig.19b). It has been shown OsRBOHH is involved in ROS production in rice roots44. The Class III peroxidases are also possibly involved in ROS production in multiple and functionally redundant ways45. To examine whether ROS is involved in the root coiling phenotype, we used the ROS fluorescent probe H2DCFDA to monitor root ROS levels in WT andcrw1grown in water. Compared with WT, the ROS level in the root tips ofcrw1was elevated dramatically, especially in the coiling region and the sloughing root cap cells (Fig.5a). Aeration of hydroponic solution had no effect on the ROS level incrw1(Supplementary Fig.20). When grown in soil or vermiculite, ROS incrw1roots returned to a low level comparable to that in WT, corresponding to the recovery of the root phenotype (Supplementary Fig.19c, d). Increased programmed cell death was observed in the root cap cells ofcrw1grown in water by the TUNEL assay (Fig.5b), which was likely induced by excess ROS46and explained whycrw1had a smaller root cap than WT. Application of the ROS scavenger N acetylcysteine (NAC, 200uM), the RBOH inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium (DPI, 50nM), or the inhibitor of the class III peroxidase salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM, 10uM) in water reduced ROS incrw1roots to the level comparable to that in WT (Fig.5aand Supplementary Fig.19e, f), prevented the excessive programmed cell death and sloughing of the root cap cells, and largely rescued the root coiling phenotype (Fig.5b, cand Supplementary Fig.19g, h). Furthermore, clearance of ROS restored the polar localization of OsPIN2 and symmetric distribution of auxin in the root tips ofcrw1(Fig.5d, e). Taken together, these data suggest that enhanced ROS generation, likely by RBOHs and PRXs, causes root coiling incrw1by accelerating sloughing of root cap cells and impairing OsPIN2 localization.\n\na eWT andcrw1were grown in water with or without 200uM NAC for 2 days.aROS fluorescence in the 0 5mm root tips (top row) and the root cap (bottom row).bTUNEL fluorescence (green) in the root cap.

Data and images shown are representative results of three independent experiments with similar results. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.\n\nTo establish the causal relationship between excess ROS and the amplified OsEIL1/2 OsERF82 module incrw1roots, we grew WT,crw1,oseil1KO/crw1lines,oseil2KO/crw1lines, andoserf82KO/crw1lines in water and examined the ROS level in root tips. Knockout ofOsEIL1,OsEIL2, orOsERF82incrw1decreased ROS to a similar level as in WT (Fig.5f h), suggesting that the amplified OsEIL1/2 OsERF82 module incrw1leads to excessive ROS generation in the root tip. To explore how enhanced OsERF82 promotes ROS production, we found that the promoter regions (approximately 3 Kb) ofOsRBOHHand three Class IIIOsPRXgenes (Os09g0323700, Os06g0695400 and Os07g0638600) contain potential ERF binding sites, including DRE/CRT (GCCGAC), GCC box (GCCGCC) and G box (CACGTG)47(Supplementary Fig.21a). The Yeast one hybrid (Y1H) and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) demonstrated that OsERF82 specifically bound to the binding sites of the DRE/CRT, GCC box and G box in the promoter region ofOsRBOHHand three Class IIIOsPRXgenes (Supplementary Fig.21b, c). Quantitative PCR showed that the transcriptional levels ofOsRBOHHand the three Class IIIOsPRXgenes were upregulated incrw1root tips compared with those in WT (Supplementary Fig.21d), whereas knockout ofOsEIL1,OsEIL2orOsERF82incrw1suppressed the upregulation of these genes (Supplementary Fig.21d). Taken together, amplified OsEIL1/2 OsERF82 causes ROS accumulation incrw1root tips likely by promoting the transcription ofOsRBOHHand Class IIIOsPRXgenes.\n\nAfter identifying amplified ethylene signaling module of OsEIL1/2 OsERF82 leading to ROS overproduction as the cause of impaired gravitropism incrw1, we explored the mechanism underlying the rescue of the root coiling phenotype incrw1when plants were grown in water saturated paddy soil and other solid media (Supplementary Fig.3). These solid media were soft and had a penetration resistance of 35 67Pa (Supplementary Fig.3a), which is 25 47 folds smaller than that in the same paddy soil unsaturated with water (moisture content 20%) and compacted to a bulk density of 1.6gcm 3(i.e. a condition similar to that used in the study of Pandey et al.30). To test the strength of mechanical resistance required to rescue thecrw1phenotype, we grew the mutant and WT in agar solidified medium varying in the hardness by adding different amounts of agar (0.3   1.2%, mass/volume).crw1showed root coiling in 0.3% and 0.4% agar media (penetration resistance 1   6Pa) just as in water or nutrient solution (Supplementary Fig.2b), curvy roots in 0.6% agar (penetration resistance 19Pa), and normal straight roots in 0.8   1.2% agar (penetration resistance 34   77Pa) (Fig.6a c). Similar phenotypic responses to different concentrations of agar (0.4%, 0.8% and 1.2%) were observed whencrw1plants were grown on the surface of vertical agar plates tilted at a 10 degrees angle to allow the root tips in contact with varying degrees of mechanical resistance (Supplementary Fig.22). These results suggest that a gentle mechanical resistance of >= 34Pa is sufficient to rescue the root coiling phenotype ofcrw1.\n\na cWT andcrw1were grown in agar with different mechanical resistance for 2 days.aPenetration resistance of agar with different concentration (0.3 1.2%).bRoot phenotypes.cRoot depth.d fWT andcrw1were grown in water with or without buoyance resistance for 2 days.da diagram for the polystyrene foam pellet experiment.eRoot phenotypes.fRoot depth.

Data and images shown are representative results of three independent experiments with similar results. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.\n\nTo further examine the effect of mechanical resistance, we attached a polystyrene foam pellet (1 mm diameter) to the root tip ofcrw1grown in water, which applied a mechanical stimulus to the root tip through the buoyance of water against the foam pellet (Fig.6d). The pellet was open at the top to allow normal gas diffusion. The resistance of the foam pellet to the root tip was estimated to be approximately 104Pa (Supplementary Fig.23). The attachment of foam pellet did not affect the root cap size and symmetric auxin distribution in WT, but largely rescued the root cap size, auxin distribution and the root coiling phenotype ofcrw1(Supplementary Fig.24and Fig.6e, f), indicating that the root tip is the site for sensing mechanical stimulus which rescues the loss of gravitropism incrw1.\n\nSoil compaction may restrict ethylene diffusion away from plant roots, thus amplifying ethylene signaling and inhibiting root growth30. We compared root growth of WT andcrw1in a paddy soil packed at a normal (1.0gcm 3) and a high (1.6gcm 3) bulk density. Both levels of bulk density restored the coiling root phenotype ofcrw1to straight roots. At 1.0 bulk density, WT,crw1and twooscrw1KOmutants showed similar root length (Supplementary Fig.25). Increasing bulk density to 1.6 decreased the root length of WT by 36% and ofcrw1and twooscrw1KOmutants by 47 51% (Supplementary Fig.25). The larger inhibition incrw1is consistent with the heightened ethylene signaling.\n\nCalcium (Ca2+) is a critical signal in plant responses to mechanical stimuli48,49. To investigate whether Ca2+signaling is involved in the rescue of the root coiling phenotype incrw1, we expressedNES YC3.650, a cytosolic Ca2+([Ca2+]cyt) reporter gene, driven by the maizeUbiquitinpromoter in WT and then introduced the gene intocrw1through crossing. The root caps of both WT andcrw1growing in four different solid media showed a significantly higher [Ca2+]cytsignal than those growing in water, and there were no significant differences between WT andcrw1(Fig.7a, b). Similarly, the [Ca2+]cytsignal remained low in the root caps of both WT andcrw1when grown in 0.3% and 0.4% agar, and increased significantly when both were grown in 0.8 1.2% agar (Supplementary Fig.26). These results suggest that a gentle mechanical resistance of approximately >= 34Pa enhances [Ca2+]cytin the root cap and beyond this threshold there is no further increase in [Ca2+]cyt. Moreover, loss of function of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 does not affect [Ca2+]cytin the root cap or its response to mechanical resistance.\n\na,bWT and crw1 (both expressingNES YC3.6) were grown in water or different soil for 2 days.aThe NES YC3.6 fluorescence in the root caps.bQuantification of NES YC3.6 fluorescence in the root caps.c jWT andcrw1expressing various reporters were grown in 0.4% and 0.8% agar with or without 100uM LaCl3for 2 3 days.

Scale bars are 1cm in (g) and 100 um in (a,c,e,f). Data and images shown are representative results of three independent experiments with similar results. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.\n\nTo investigate whether the enhanced Ca2+signal in the root cap is involved in the recovery ofcrw1's phenotypes, we applied 100uM LaCl3, a Ca2+channel blocker, to 0.8% agar. We found that LaCl3suppressed [Ca2+]cytin the root caps (Fig.7c, d) and largely abolished the rescue effect of mechanical resistance on the root cap size and auxin distribution (Fig.7e, f). Importantly, the addition of LaCl3abolished the recovery of the root coiling phenotype incrw1grown in 0.8 1.2% agar (Fig.7gand Supplementary Fig.27), indicating the root cap calcium signal triggered by mechanosensing is required for the rescue of gravitropism incrw1.\n\nThe observation that growing in soil prevented overaccumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 incrw1roots (Fig.4a, b) suggests that mechanosensing Ca2+signaling may rescue the root coiling phenotype ofcrw1by limiting the accumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2. Western blot showed thatcrw1roots accumulated OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 when grown in 0.4% agar, and accumulation of the two proteins was suppressed to the WT levels when grown in 0.8% agar (Fig.7h, i). Addition of 100uM LaCl3to 0.8% agar suppressed [Ca2+]cytin the root caps, resulting in an over accumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 in thecrw1roots (Fig.7h, i). There were no significant differences in the transcript levels ofOsEIL1andOsEIL2between WT andcrw1in different agar concentrations or between 0.8% agar with and without addition of LaCl3(Supplementary Fig.28), suggesting that the effect of mechanosensing induced Ca2+signaling on the protein levels of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 is not related to transcriptional regulation ofOsEIL1andOsEIL2. Furthermore, upregulation ofOsERF82and excess ROS production incrw1roots were observed when grown in 0.4% agar but not in 0.8% agar, whereas the addition of LaCl3to 0.8% agar medium significantly increasedOsERF82transcription and ROS accumulation incrw1roots (Fig.7jand Supplementary Fig.29). In WT roots, OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 proteins were kept at low levels because of the presence of OsCRW1, which likely explains the lack of response ofOsERF82transcription and ROS level to mechano sensing induced Ca2+signaling in WT. These results suggest that mechano sensing induced Ca2+signaling inhibits the amplified module of OsEIL1/OsEIL2 OsERF82 ROS incrw1, and rescues the root cap structure, OsPIN2 polar localization, auxin distribution, and consequently gravitropism.\n\nRice roots show considerable natural variation in the growth phenotype when grown in hydroponics. During the screen of a panel of 230 rice accessions consisting mainly of landraces in the lower Yangtze River delta in China, we found that 53, 46 and 131 accessions exhibited the root coiling, straight root, and intermediate phenotypes, respectively, when grown in water (Supplementary Fig.30a). We randomly selected 8 accessions each with coiling or straight roots (Supplementary Fig.30b, c). Quantitative PCR showed that the group of root coiling accessions had a significantly lower level ofOsCRW1transcript than the group with straight roots (Supplementary Fig.30d). Addition of 1 MCP to water straightened the coiling roots (Supplementary Fig.30e), suggesting the phenotype in these rice accessions is likely caused by enhanced ethylene signaling. When grown in water saturated paddy soil, the root coiling phenotype was completely rescued (Supplementary Fig.30f), which is consistent with the phenotype recovery ofcrw1. In highly compacted soil, coiling root accessions showed shorter root elongation than straight root accessions, which is consistent with the phenotypes ofcrw1and WT, respectively (Supplementary Fig.30g).",
    "discussion": "Ethylene plays a critical role in plant growth, development and resistance to multiple biotic and abiotic stresses. Because ethylene biosynthesis fluctuates widely under the influence of changing environments18,51, its effect on gravitropic growth of roots must be tightly regulated. In this study, by dissecting the genetic basis for the root coiling phenotype in the rice mutantcrw1, we uncovered the molecular module of OsCRW1 (OsEBF1) OsEIL1/OsEIL2 OsERF82 ROS that connects ethylene signaling to gravitropism in rice roots (Fig.8). Furthermore, by addressing why growing in soft solid media rescued root coiling phenotype ofcrw1, we discovered an unexpected role of root cap mechanosensing in limiting excessive ethylene signaling, thereby safeguarding gravitropic growth of rice roots (Fig.8).\n\nThe presence of OsCRW1 and mechanosensing of root tips maintains root gravitropism in soil. OsCRW1 and the mechanosensing induced Ca2+signaling inhibit the ethylene signaling module of OsEIL1/OsEIL2 OsERF82 to control ROS homeostasis in root tips, consequently maintaining the structural stability of root cap and polar localization of OsPIN2, ultimately ensuring gravitropism in rice roots. Some components of this Figure were creased with Adobe Illustrator (https://helpx.adobe.com/cn/support/illustrator.html).\n\nThe gravitropic growth of roots depends on the perception of gravity by the root cap and the symmetric distribution of auxin in the root tip. The former requires amyloplast as the gravity responder to transmit the gravity signal via LAZY proteins6,7, and the latter is tightly controlled by polar localized auxin transporters such as PIN212. Mutations of critical genes in auxin transport (e.g.pin212,aux113,eir136), amyloplast synthesis52,53and gravity signaling6,7cause plant roots to display defective gravitropic behaviors during vertical growth. The impact of ethylene signaling on root gravitropism appears to vary among plant species. InArabidopsis, loss of function mutations of the key genes that control ethylene biosynthesis or signal transduction, includingETO1,CTR1, EIN2,andEIN3, did not affect gravitropic growth of roots35. In contrast, disruption ofEIL1andEIN2homologous genes in rice or maize resulted in enlarged angle of adventitious roots when grown in hydroponic, indicating a weakened gravitropism35. In the present study, we found that loss of function of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 led to coiling of both seminal and adventitious roots of rice in hydroponic culture, indicative of a severe disruption of gravitropism. The F box proteins EBFs bind to EIN3 and EIL proteins, thus promoting their degradation via a ubiquitin/proteasome pathway27,28. The loss of function of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 led to overaccumulation of OsEIL1/2 proteins in rice roots and consequently amplified ethylene signaling. We identified OsERF82, a hitherto unreported ethylene response factor, as the downstream target of OsEIL1/2. OsERF82 transcriptionally regulates the expression of several genes involved in ROS production, includingOsRBOHHand several Class III peroxidase genes. The elevated expression ofOsERF82incrw1enhanced the expression of these ROS related genes, resulting in an excessive accumulation of ROS in the root tip. Apart from OsERF82, it is possible that other target genes regulated by OsEIL1 may also play a small role in the coiling root phenotype ofcrw1.\n\nWe found that excessive ROS accumulation in the root tip ofcrw1accelerates root cap sloughing through programed cell death, thereby reducing the number of amyloplast and weakening gravity perception. Furthermore, excessive accumulation of ROS disrupted the symmetrical auxin distribution in the root tip by impairing the polar localization of OsPIN2. This is consistent with an earlier finding that application of exogenous H2O2inhibits vesicle mediated trafficking and polar localization of AtPIN2 inArabidopsis54. Disrupted polar localization of OsPIN2 and reduced root cap stability together explain the severe loss of gravitropism incrw1roots. Thus, limiting ethylene signaling in thenucleus is critical for the normal gravitropic growth of rice roots.\n\nAlthough growing in compacted soil may increase the ethylene level in roots due to restricted gas diffusion30, we found that gentle mechanical resistance that rice roots typically encounter in water saturated paddy soil or other soft solid media enhances the degradation of OsEIL1/OsEIL2 and thus dampens the excessive ethylene signaling incrw1, leading to rescue of the root coiling phenotype. The mechanical resistance required to antagonize ethylene signaling amplification is mild (penetration resistance >= 34Pa), consistent with the soft nature of submerged paddy soil that rice plants are adapted to. This level of mechanical resistance is more than an order of magnitude lower than in water unsaturated and compacted soil used in the study of Pandey et al.30. Strong mechanical resistance can inhibit root elongation or change the direction of root growth. For example, root tips stop growing when encountering three dimensional impenetrable compactness30, change direction to avoid a flat obstacle55, or grow in a wavy or circular manner on an impenetrable agar slope56 58. A recent study showed thatArabidopsisroots growing on the agar surface can produce different growth paths in response to subtle changes of mechanical forces59. In the present study, mild mechanical resistance did not affect the normal root growth of WT but was sufficient to ensure gravitropic root growth ofcrw1and coiling root accessions, suggesting that mechanical resistance below the level that inhibits root growth can be sensed by rice roots to help safeguard gravitropism. Such an effect has not been reported before but is consistent with previous findings that plants can sensitively perceive different strengths of mechanical stimuli from nature and produce rapid thigmonastic responses or gradual morphogenetic alterations60,61.\n\nWe found that the rescue of root gravitropism incrw1by gentle mechanical resistance requires Ca2+signaling in the root cap. In the absence of OsCRW1/OsEBF1, mechanosensing induced Ca2+signaling safeguards the gravitropic growth ofcrw1roots by suppressing the accumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2. How enhanced Ca2+signaling in the root cap prevents over accumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 remains unclear and warrants further investigation. The observation that knockout ofOsEBF2incrw1did not affect the rescue of the root coiling phenotype by gentle mechanical resistance suggests that enhanced Ca2+signaling promotes the degradation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 proteins in an OsCRW1/OsEBF1 and OsEBF2 independent mechanism. Mechanosensing induced Ca2+signaling may play a particularly important role in keeping ethylene signaling in check under stress conditions, which suppress the translation of OsCRW1/OsEBF143, or in natural rice accessions with a weak or loss of function OsCRW1. On the other hand, although OsCRW1 may be dispensable in uncompacted soil, it is needed to restrict excessive ethylene signaling in compacted soil to reduce the inhibition on root growth.\n\nInterestingly, we observed that the root coiling phenotype was present in some natural rice accessions when grown in hydroponics, and the phenotype was apparently related to the transcription level ofOsCRW1/OsEBF1. Some of the coiling root accessions had aOsCRW1/OsEBF1transcript level similar to those in the straight root accessions, suggesting that variation in the protein level or in the coding sequence may also be involved. Growing these rice accessions in soft paddy soil also restored their gravitropic growth. A lower level of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 may be advantageous for stress resistance because of enhanced ethylene signaling, especially when root gravitropic growth can be safeguarded by mechanosensing. Several stress response pathways were enriched in the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) betweencrw1and WT (Fig.3b). Among these DEGs, at least 24 genes that were upregulated incrw1have been previously reported to be involved in the resistance to drought, salinity, cold, or diseases (Supplemental Fig.31). Evolution of land plants is accompanied with expansion of genes involved in hormone signaling and transcription factors62. Our study shows that mechanosensing induced Ca2+signaling plays an unexpected role in balancing the ethylene auxin signaling pathways for gravitropic growth of plants in soil.",
