    "abstract": "Measurements of telomere length in skeletal muscle stem cells (MuSCs), a rare cell population within muscles, provide insights into cellular dysfunction in diseased conditions. Here, we describe a protocol (cryosectionmusclequantitativefluorescentinsituhybridization) using skeletal muscle cryosections for assessments of telomere length in MuSCs, in their native environment. Using a free software, telomere length measurements are assessed on a single cell level. We also provide methodology to perform data analyses in several ways.\n\nFor complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer toTichy etal. (2021).\n\nSubject areas:Cell Biology, Cell isolation, Cell based Assays, In Situ Hybridization, Microscopy, Stem Cells",
