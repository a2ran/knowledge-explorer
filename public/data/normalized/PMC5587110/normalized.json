    "abstract": "The International Space Station (ISS) National Laboratory is dedicated to studying the effects of space on life and physical systems, and to developing new science and technologies for space exploration. A key aspect of achieving these goals is to operate the ISS National Lab more like an Earth based laboratory, conducting complex end to end experimentation, not limited to simple microgravity exposure. Towards that end NASA developed a novel suite of molecular biology laboratory tools, reagents, and methods, named WetLab 2, uniquely designed to operate in microgravity, and to process biological samples for real time gene expression analysis on orbit. This includes a novel fluidic RNA Sample Preparation Module and fluid transfer devices, all in one lyophilized PCR assays, centrifuge, and a real time PCR thermal cycler. Here we describe the results from the WetLab 2 validation experiments conducted in microgravity during ISS increment 47/SPX 8. Specifically, quantitative PCR was performed on a concentration series of DNA calibration standards, and Reverse Transcriptase quantitative PCR was conducted on RNA extracted and purified on orbit from frozenEscherichia coliand mouse liver tissue. Cycle threshold (Ct) values and PCR efficiencies obtained on orbit from DNA standards were similar to Earth (1 g) controls. Also, on orbit multiplex analysis of gene expression from bacterial cells and mammalian tissue RNA samples was successfully conducted in about 3 h, with data transmitted within 2 h of experiment completion. Thermal cycling in microgravity resulted in the trapping of gas bubbles inside septa cap assay tubes, causing small but measurable increases in Ct curve noise and variability. Bubble formation was successfully suppressed in a rapid follow up on orbit experiment using standard caps to pressurize PCR tubes and reduce gas release during heating cycles. The WetLab 2 facility now provides a novel operational on orbit research capability for molecular biology and demonstrates the feasibility of more complex wet bench experiments in the ISS National Lab environment.",
    "methods": "In order to validate the system, a number of ground based and on orbit tests were performed including: validation ofE.coliprimer assays (ground), validation of lyophilized components (ground), validation of the SPM (ground), validation of all hardware (ground), validation of qPCR efficiency using pre prepared assays (on orbit), validation of RNA extracted fromE.coli(on orbit), and from mouse liver tissue (on orbit) using the SPM. The methods used in these validation experiments are described in detail below.\n\nThis study used three types of assays for different portions of the validation of the system. First, anE.coligenomic assay was used to demonstrate if qPCR was possible in microgravity and that the data matched 1 g controls. This was followed with a set ofE.coligene expression assays designed to validate the sample prep and RT qPCR capabilities of the system. Finally, a set of mouse gene expression assays were used to validate the system with a mammalian tissue.\n\nTheE.coliprimers and probes used in this study were designed in house to target both genomic and exonic regions. TheE.coligenomic assay consisted of primers targeting the 16S ribosomal DNA sequence forrrnHgene while the gene expression assays targeted the following genes: heat shock protein 70 2 (dnaK), RNA polymerase (rpoA), and a glucitol operon repressor (srlR). For mouse assays, pre designed intron spanning assays targeting genes for glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) and 60S ribosomal protein L19 (rpl19) were used for normalization and fibronectin 1 (fn1) was used to measure gene expression analysis. All primers and probes were produced by Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT, Coralville, Iowa). In all cases, TaqMan based technology was used [18]. The corresponding fluorescent dye and its primer and probe sequences are shown inTable 1.\n\nE.coliprimers and probes were designed in house, mouse assays were selected from those available from IDT. 56 FAM: 5' 6 FAM (Fluorescein), ZEN tm IDT Trademark dark quencher, 3IABKFQ: 3' Iowa Black Fluorescent Quencher, 3BHQ_1: 3' Black Hole Quencher, 5HEX: 5' Hexachlorofluorescein, 5Cy5: 5' Cyanine5; 3IAbRQSp: 3' Iowa BlackRQ Sp\n\nTo validate theE.coligenomic assay formulation, we analyzed qPCR performance using varying quantities of template in tenfold dilutions between 1 ug and 1 pg (inclusive). Assays were constituted using high molecular weight genomic DNA fromE.colitype B cells (Affymetrix, Sunnyvale, CA), custom primers and probe targeting a 16S ribosomal DNA sequence (IDT, Coralville, Iowa), GoTaq Probe Master Mix (Promega, Madison, WI), and molecular biology grade water (TekNova, Hollister, CA). Amplification was achieved via a standard thermal protocol that included a hot start activation step (95 degreesC, 2 min) and 45 cycles of denaturation (95 degreesC, 15 s) and annealing/extension (54 degreesC, 60 s). Samples were run in duplicate technical replicates and their average Ct values were plotted against template concentration to determine R square and efficiency of amplification. Products were confirmed using a Bioanalyzer 2100 and an Agilent DNA chip, using a DNA 1000 protocol and reagent.\n\nGenomic and gene expression assays forE.coli(dnaK,rpoAandsrIR) and mouse tissue (gapdh, rpl19, and fn1) were validated using genomicE.coliDNA and RNA fromE.coliK12 TB1 (New England Biolabs Inc, Ipswich, MA) and whole livers from male C57BL/6 12 16 week perfused/snap frozen (Charles River, Wilmington, MA). Initial feasibility studies however utilized mouse liver tissues obtained under NASA Ames Research Center IACUC protocols NAS 14 002 Yr1 3 and NAS 15 008 Y1 2 (E. Almeida and E. Blaber). RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and tested to have a RNA Integrity Number (RIN) greater than 9.0 using a Bioanalyzer 2100 and RNA 6000 Pico Chip. Each assay was validated using the appropriate RNA template in a RT qPCR cocktail. Singleplex, duplex and triplex reactions were validated for each organism. Amplification was achieved via a single step RT qPCR thermal protocol that includes a Reverse Transcription (45 degreesC, 15 min), hot start activation step (95 degreesC, 2 min) and 45 cycles of denaturation (95 degreesC, 15 s) and annealing/extension (54 degreesC, 60 s), further detailed online at protocols.io [19].\n\nAfter successful validation of assay performance, all assay formulations were purchased as lyophilized sample ready products in the Reaction Tubes (BioGX, Birmingham, AL). The protocol for lyophilized assay generation is detailed in online at protocols.io [20]. To test the performance of the lyophilized assays, Ct values of lyophilized assays were compared to those of non lyophilized controls. For theE.coligenomic assay three concentrations of template; high (100 ng), mid (1 ng), and low (10 pg), along with no template controls (NTC), were run for each group. Non lyophilized controls were constituted as described above while lyophilized assays were re hydrated with elution buffer (Claremont BioSolutions, Upland, CA). LyophilizedE.coliand mouse liver gene expression assays were tested by running singleplex, duplex, and triplex reactions. Individual, average, and standard deviation of Ct values were compared to corresponding controls, within template groups. Two individual lots were tested against a single benchtop control lot. BioGX also carried out independent validation of the lyophilized products.\n\nRNA isolation was performed utilizing an alcohol free version of the RNA binding buffer and washes for Claremont BioSolutions' commercially available OmniLyse[21,22] and their RNAexpresscolumn. The process was carried out in a SPM, an enclosed microgravity compatible hardware module designed to require only simple manual manipulations that can be performed by an untrained user. The SPM contains syringes preloaded with wash and elution buffers and has an input port with a Luer Lokconnection for the incoming Sample Transfer Tool (STT). The procedure consists of lysing the sample with the battery powered OmniLyseand binding of RNA to the RNAexpresscolumn. This is followed by two washes of the column with Claremont BioSolutions wash buffer in preloaded syringes. The RNA is then eluted into a removable syringe using the Claremont BioSolutions elution buffer.\n\nTo test the SPM performance, 100 millionE.colicells or 5 mg of mouse liver tissue were used for RNA extraction. Resulting RNA quantity and quality were assessed using a NanoDrop 2000(Thermofisher, Waltham, MD) and a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA), respectively. The SPM derived RNA was also used as the template in RT qPCR reactions prepared as stated above.\n\nTo determine the compatibility of hardware components, reagents were stored in hardware for long duration testing and were assessed for compatibility with downstream molecular biology applications (e.g. qPCR, RNA Isolation, and RT qPCR).\n\nACT2s (specialty microgravity compatible transfer hardware, Techshot, Greenville, IN) and Finger Loop syringes (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ) were loaded and stored at  80 degreesC. Units were removed from the freezer at designated time points, allowed to thaw at ambient temperature (at least 1 h for the ACT2and 45 min for the Finger Loop syringe), then RNA was extracted using the SPM procedure described above. To test the SPMs for reagent compatibility, SPMs were assembled with the syringes preloaded with wash and elution buffers and stored at ambient temperatures. At designated time points, SPMs were used to isolate fresh samples of either 1x108E.colicells or 5 mg of mouse liver tissue. For all hardware tests, RNA quantity and quality were assessed as described previously. RT qPCR using sample specific primers and probe were also used to test RNA quality as described previously.\n\nReaction Tubes containing lyophilizedE.coliand mouse gene expression assays, master mixes and enzymes were packaged at BioGX (8 tubes per sealed pouch) and stored at 4 degreesC until tested. All lyophilized mixes were tested at designated time points and utilized 25 ng ofE.colior mouse Qiagen RNeasy purified RNA (as appropriate) in 25 ul of molecular biology grade water to rehydrate the assays. Amplification conditions used were described above. In all cases, results were compared to those from the t = 0 time point. The thermocycler to be flown to the ISS was also validated prior to use.\n\nDetails of all hardware testing results are shown in theS2 Text.\n\nMicrogravity data generated in this study were attained from on orbit operations onboard the ISS. All materials, hardware, and biology were transported during the SpaceX CRS 8 cargo resupply mission that launched to the ISS on April 8th, 2016 and experiments were conducted on April 19th, 22nd, 26th, 29thand May 2nd. Operations required the use of the WetLab 2 hardware suite consisting of microgravity compatible STT (ACT2or Finger Loop syringe), SPM, bubble removing Pipette Loader (PL), reaction tube centrifugation rotor and a Cepheid SmartCyclerfor thermocycling/fluorescence readout, as described inS1 Text. 1 g control data were generated using identical protocols and hardware within 12 h of completion of ISS operations. The on orbit operations consisted of three types of tests. First, the efficiency of qPCR in microgravity using pre prepared reaction mixtures includingE.coligenomic DNA was tested three times. Second, isolation of RNA on orbit using the SPM and pre frozenE.colicells followed by analysis of gene expression was tested followed by testing of RNA isolation from mammalian tissue using the SPM and pre frozen mouse liver tissue followed by analysis of gene expression.\n\nFor each experiment, one ISS and one ground kit were removed from their respective cold stowage (both 4 degreesC and  80 degreesC if applicable) and allowed to equilibrate at room temperature for 2 7 h. For ISS operations, experiments were performed within a RNase free and cleaned Disposable Glove Bag (DGB) to prevent contamination. At the start of ISS operations, session materials contained in RNase free bags were placed into the DGB and wiped with RNase AWAYwipes (Molecular BioProducts, Waltham, MA). The 1 g control experiment was conducted in a standard molecular biology laboratory; all work surfaces were cleaned using RNase AWAYwipes and 70% ethanol. Data from the ISS experiments were downlinked within 2 h of completion of the clean up activity and results were statistically compared with those from corresponding 1 g controls. A total of five ISS runs were performed; one dataset was lost due to a PL hardware malfunction. All five 1 g control experiments were performed nominally.\n\nThe efficiency of qPCR performed in microgravity was determined using reaction mixtures containing low, mid, or high concentrations ofE.coliDNA template and a no template control (NTC) as described above. Reagents were lyophilized in custom capped SmartCyclerreaction tubes on December 1st, 2015. Four tubes of each concentration were packaged into tube kits. All tube kits and the elution buffer were transported and stored at 4 degreesC to minimize loss of enzyme activity and maintain quality. On orbit operations consisted of de bubbling the buffer using the PL and loading it into a repeater pipette that was used to add 25 ul to each reaction tube. The tubes were centrifuged and loaded into the SmartCycler to analyze qPCR efficiency.\n\nRNA isolation using the SPM in microgravity was validated using 1x108E.colicells grown on the ground and transferred into a STT (ACT2) and stored at  80 degreesC or colder.E.coliRNA isolation and RT qPCR was performed on April 29th2016. Tube kits for this study consisted of four tubes each of singleplex assay dnaK FAM, singleplex rpoA HEX, duplex (dnaK FAM and rpoA HEX), and triplex (dnaK FAM, rpoA HEX and srlR Cy5). All assay and RT qPCR reagents were lyophilized in SmartCyclerReaction Tubes on Dec 1st, 2015. The tube kits were transported and stored at 4 degreesC until used while other hardware and consumables were kept at ambient. On orbit operations consisted of processing the bacterial culture through the SPM, followed by de bubbling and tube loading as stated above. The tubes were centrifuged and loaded into the SmartCyclerfor gene expression analysis with RT qPCR.\n\nTo test isolation of RNA from mammalian tissue in microgravity using the SPM, 5 mg of mouse liver tissue were biopsied on the ground and transferred into a STT (10 ml finger loop syringe) with 2 ml of lysis buffer (Claremont BioSolutions, Upland, CA). Samples were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at  80 degreesC on March 4th, 2016. Mouse liver tissue RNA isolation and RT qPCR was performed on May 2nd2016. Tube kits for this study consisted of four tubes each of singleplex assay gapdh FAM, singleplex rpl19 HEX, duplex (gapdh FAM and rpl19 HEX), and triplex (gapdh FAM, rpl19 HEX and fn1 Cy5). The reagents were lyophilized and transported as described above. On orbit operations were the same as those for the bacterial culture.\n\nA follow on experiment was performed on October 19th, 2016 during increment 49, using a spareE.colikit. This experiment consisted of a repeat of theE.coligene expression study, however, at the start of operations, modified septa caps were removed from 4 technical replicates of the singleplex reaction (dnaK FAM) and 4 technical replicates of the duplex reaction (dnaK FAM, rpoA HEX) tubes. After addition of the RNA, the reaction tubes were closed using clipped tube caps from commercial Cepheid SmartTubes (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA). The 1 g control experiment was conducted with a 24 h delay.\n\nCepheid SmartCycler 2.0d software was used to analyze all fluorescence intensities and generate Ct values. All pre launch ground testing used the default software values (Background Subtraction: ON, Background Min: 5, Background Max: 40, Primary Curve Analysis, Manual Threshold: 30, Boxcar Averaging: 0), while microgravity to 1 g comparisons used slightly modified values with a Boxcar averaging of 3. Genomic DNA qPCR runs used: Background Subtraction: ON, Background Min: 5, Background Max: 40, Primary Curve Analysis, Manual Threshold: 30, Boxcar Averaging: 3; software values for theE.coliRT qPCR runs: Background Subtraction: ON, Background Min: 1, Background Max: 40, Primary Curve Analysis, Manual Thresholds: (FAM: 15, HEX: 15, Cy5: 15) Boxcar Averaging: 3; and software values for the mouse liver RT qPCR runs: Background Subtraction: ON, Background Min: 5, Background Max: 40, Primary Curve Analysis, Manual Thresholds: (FAM: 15, HEX: 30, Cy5: 15) Boxcar Averaging: 3; for the Increment 49 Bubble Mitigation run: Background Subtraction: ON, Background Min: 1, Background Max: 40, Primary Curve Analysis, Manual Thresholds: (FAM: 15, HEX: 15, Cy5: 15) Boxcar Averaging: 0. Amplification efficiency was calculated using the formula: E = (10[ 1/slope] 1)*100.\n\nStatistical analyses were performed using JMP10 (SAAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) and GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software Inc, La Jolla, CA). Comparisons made between microgravity and 1 g control data, or between lyophilized and benchtop control assays across different template concentrations were evaluated using ANOVA or Student'st testas appropriate. In all cases, figures report the mean +/  standard deviation (SD) andp<= 0.05 was considered the threshold for significance. Outliers were calculated using Grubb's test with alpha = 0.05.",
    "results": "In order to assess the functionality of PCR in microgravity conditions and to establish the dynamic range and efficiency of amplification, we designed a robust quality control qPCR assay to measure these parameters. We targeted a 16S ribosomal region of genomicE.coliDNA. The abundant target expression improved precision, sensitivity, and reproducibility, providing robust assay conditions.\n\nValidation of theE.coligenomic DNA assay was performed using a standard thermal cycling protocol with controlled quantities of commercially availableE.coliDNA as template. Assays were tested with template quantities between 1 pg and 1 ug, in duplicates (Fig 2A), and evaluated based on amplification plot characteristics and reaction efficiency. Results show that assays successfully generated amplification products, as detected by qPCR, with fluorescence peaks between 300 and 600 units. Assay efficiency was determined to be at 96.8% with an R2greater than 0.99 (Fig 2Ainset). Specificity and accuracy was confirmed by gel band migration analysis, with the product amplicon generating bands of the expected molecular size.\n\n(A) qPCR assays targeting theE.coli16S ribosomal gene were validated on the ground using seven tenfold dilutions of template to measure sensitivity and efficiency (inset). (B) Amplification curve from qPCR run conducted on the ISS with photo of a representative tube pre  and post  run in microgravity (inset). (C F) qPCR amplification curves from the microgravity (C & D) and 1 g control (E & F) runs. All curves use the default SmartCycler values with the exception that the boxcar correction is set to 3. Efficiency graphs are shown on the insets. (G & H) Ct values for low (0.01 ng/test), mid (1 ng/test), and high (100 ng/test) assays during both experimental runs are shown using scatter plots with jitter. ug = microgravity.\n\nIn order to minimize crew time and the need for refrigeration resources, pre formulated reagents were lyophilized in the Cepheid SmartTube detection window. To validate that the lyophilized assay format and lyophilization process did not compromise assay performance [23], we tested the lyophilized products by assessing qPCR performance in comparison to commercial non lyophilized reagents (control). This was performed using high, mid and low template concentrations and a NTC. Combined data between two lots of lyophilized product show that lyophilized assays were able to consistently generate Ct values similar to those generated by non lyophilized controls (seeTable 2).\n\nLyophilized and non lyophilized assay comparison of qPCR cycle threshold data forE.coliDNA Assay for (High, Mid, Low) DNA template amount, and RT qPCR cycle threshold data forE.coliand mouse liver RNA. There are no statistical differences between lyophilized assays and commercial non lyophilized assays. Data shows Ct values +/  SD.\n\nFollowing transport to the ISS and an initial software and instrument setup, the system was tested with three runs of theE.coligenomic DNA assay. Data from the first run is shown inFig 2Band has a typical qPCR amplification curve, although an unusual amount of noise was observed in microgravity samples especially in later cycles. Furthermore, when the default SmartCycler software values were used, outliers were observed resulting in high standard deviations between replicate samples. These outliers did not impair the clustering of the on orbit data with the respective DNA concentrations.\n\nData from a second run was similar to the first but a third repeat run did not yield results due to tube dispensing errors attributed to a PL malfunction. Post run photos of the tubes showed that no liquid was transferred into most of the tubes.\n\nNoise in the curves was attributed to degassing bubble formation in the tube detection windows during thermal cycling [24 26], as confirmed by post run photos of the tubes. Photos of all tubes were taken before and after thermal protocol completion, the inset inFig 2Bshows pre  and post run photos of a representative tube for reference. The pre and post photos of the tubes reveal significant bubble formation and microgravity trapping during the heating cycles of the qPCR reaction. The bubbles were likely caused by degassing during thermocycling [26] and their evolution and trapping may cause noise in fluorescence intensity detection. We used the SmartCycler software boxcar averaging to smooth out the amplification curve noise, but otherwise kept the default software values. All statistical comparisons for this study used this data.\n\nShortly after the completion of each of the on orbit operations, a 1 g control run was performed. Care was taken to match the removal time of the lyophilized assays from 4 degreesC to the start of operations.Fig 2C 2Fshows side by side comparisons of microgravity runs and their matched 1 g controls. Amplification curves from the corresponding 1 g control runs were smooth and similar to those obtained during previous testing. Non specific amplification, as observed from the NTC tubes (black lines), were seen on both microgravity and 1 g control graphs. Given that the target gene is a 16S rRNA, non specific amplification in the NTC samples may be seen when Taq polymerase is bacteria derived [27] or due to primer derived artifacts. Microgravity fluorescence intensity values also show a lower overall amplitude potentially due to bubbles blocking/reducing some of the collected fluorescence signal [24 26]. Raw background fluorescence data between microgravity and 1 g control were also compared and details can be found in theS1 File.\n\nComparison of microgravity and 1 g control Ct values revealed that despite the noise and reduced intensity in microgravity samples, the Ct values still appear to be comparable to 1 g control results as seen inFig 2G & 2Hand inS1 Table.\n\nEfficiency plots for the microgravity and 1 g control samples (Fig 2C 2Finsets) were generated with Ct values using a Boxcar averaging of 3 and otherwise default software settings. The efficiency for the 1 g control data was 105.1% for run 1 and 102.7% for run 2 and the linear standard curve R2= 0.9971 and 0.9985 respectively and microgravity data was 104.1% and 108.1% and R2= 0.9620 and 0.9865 respectively. One microgravity PCR efficiency was slightly outside of the optimal efficiency range of 90 105%, likely due to the effects of bubbles present in the detection window.\n\nE.coliand mouse gene expression assays were tested and validated using Qiagen RNeasy derived RNA. For both species, genes were tested using the same singleplex, duplex, and triplex formats that were planned to be used on ISS.Table 3shows representative Ct value data. All primer and probe sets yielded consistent RT qPCR reactions with resulting Ct values between 19 and 24 when 100 ng of starting RNA was used.\n\nLyophilizedE.coliand mouse RNA gene expression assays, singleplex, duplex and triplex formulations, were tested as described above. All lyophilized assays generated similar PCR amplification compared to the non lyophilized controls indicating that the more labile Reverse Transcriptase enzyme [28,29] remained active.Table 3shows the results from the triplex assays, results generated by the singleplex and duplex assays yielded similar results. ANOVA analyses of these results showed no statistical variation between lyophilized assays and their non lyophilized controls, therefore indicating that lyophilized assays were suitable for use on ISS.\n\nAn enclosed, simple RNA extraction procedure not requiring toxic chemicalsthat may complicate operation on ISS, was adapted (by removing alcohol) from commercially available Claremont BioSolutions products (Fig 3A). The resulting SPM was tested to ensure that the RNA yield was of sufficient quantity and quality for RT qPCR [30]. Following optimization, RNA yields from the SPM were 2 10 ug for 1 x 108E.coliand 1.5 8 ug for 5 mg mouse liver. The RNA quality was adequate with RINs of 7.9 +/ 1.2 forE.coliand 7.4 +/ 1.6 for mouse liver.Fig 3Bshows typical SPM extracted RNA quality at 1 g for bothE.coliand mouse liver. Ct values from RT qPCR runs using RNA isolated from the SPM were also similar to results from Qiagen purified RNA. ResidualE.coliRNA purified in microgravity was returned to Earth on SpaceX CRS 8 for Bioanalyzer testing. The RNA extracted in microgravity (RIN 8.5) was compared to that of RNA extracted at 1 g on the same day (RIN 8) and is of comparable quality (Fig 3B) showing that RNA was successfully purified on the ISS.\n\n(A) Photo of SPM. (B) Typical RNA quality from SPM withE.coli(left panel) and mouse liver (right panel), control Qiagen (left lane) SPM (right lane). Center panel shows RNA quality from the 1 g control (left lane) and the returned microgravity sample from ISS (right lane). (C E) Scatter plots with jitter of the microgravity and 1 g controlE.colisingleplex (C), duplex (D) and triplex (E) reactions. One outlier is indicated by the open marker in C. One of the microgravity triplex tubes did not give a dnaK FAM signal (E). (F H) Scatter plots with jitter of the microgravity and 1 g control mouse liver singleplex (F), duplex (G) and triplex (H) reactions. One outlier from the microgravity triplex fn1 plot is indicated by the open marker and no gapdh FAM signal was seen in the microgravity triplex reactions (H).\n\nAfter confirming that qPCR in microgravity was possible and with results comparable to 1 g controls, we proceeded to test the capability of the hardware system to isolate and process samples in microgravity. AnE.colisample, used to test the system's capabilities with prokaryotic cells, was processed and analyzed on ISS as described previously. The RT qPCR assays tested included singleplex (Fig 3C), duplex (Fig 3D), and triplex (Fig 3E) reactions (S1 Table), each performed in quadruplicate to improve statistical sampling. All microgravity and 1 g control reactions resulted in readable Ct data. In agreement with previous results, microgravity Ct values exhibited increased variability compared to 1 g controls. Despite the greater variability observed in microgravity Ct values, no statistically significant difference was found between the microgravity and 1 g control data. One outlier was identified in the microgravity data and was not used in statistical comparisons. Also, one microgravity triplex tube did not give data in the FAM channel (dnaK).\n\nThe final study explored the system's capabilities to isolate RNA from a mammalian tissue, using the resulting RNA as the template in RT qPCR analysis. Similar to theE.coliexperiment, quadruplicates of singleplex (Fig 3F), duplex (Fig 3G), and triplex (Fig 3H) RT qPCR reactions were conducted. A significant correlation between the microgravity and 1 g control data was observed, however, microgravity data exhibited increased variability. These results indicate that RNA was successfully isolated from mouse liver tissue during spaceflight.\n\nSingleplex and duplex assays of the reference genes gapdh and rpl19 showed no statistical differences between microgravity and 1 g control. However, in spaceflight, no gapdh FAM signal was observed during triplex assays whilst 1 g control triplex assays resulted in detection of all three genes.\n\nFollowing the completion of on orbit activities, an opportunity arose several months later to test bubble formation mitigation strategies while repeating theE.coliisolation activity. To test this, half of the modified reaction tube septa caps were replaced with standard SmartTube caps. However, the age of the sample preparation reagents was past the latest longevity testing duration and this test resulted in compromised Ct values in the FAM and Cy5 channels. The HEX channel appeared to be unaffected as seen inFig 4. A reduction in noise was observed with the use of standard caps (Fig 4B) as compared to the typical noise seen when septa caps are used (Fig 4A). Additionally, photos taken of the tubes after completion of the RT qPCR run show an increase in the number of bubbles in the septa capped tubes as compared to those with standard caps. We hypothesize that the internal tube pressure created when inserting the standard caps helps mitigate bubble formation. This was corroborated by sideways and inverted (upside down) ground thermocycling experiments that also trapped bubbles.\n\n(A) HEX amplification curves when our modified septa caps are used. (B) HEX amplification curves from tubes sealed with the standard commercial SmartTube Caps. Post run photos of representative tubes are shown above.",
    "discussion": "One of the major obstacles to space exploration going forward in the coming decades is the fact that microgravity research outposts such as ISS are so closely dependent on Earth support of everyday activities, and lack the ability to operate autonomously. The National Academies of Sciences in their Decadal Survey [5] have identified some of these limitations as important concerns and offered direction that the ISS should operate more like Earth based laboratories, allowing for experiments to be designed, conducted, modified and iterated in space. Despite the thousands of investigations already conducted on ISS [31], there are still overwhelming limitations [32,33] that prevent science and specifically molecular biology measurements of gene expression from being conducted and analyzed on orbit.\n\nFrom its inception, the NASA WetLab 2 project has sought to address these concerns by introducing new, time efficient, practical and flexible molecular biology gene expression analysis capabilities to the ISS. The WetLab 2 hardware system can now rapidly perform RNA isolation on orbit and use those RNAs to immediately conduct RT qPCR analyses, or other novel analyses such as nanopore based RNA sequencing. The utility of WetLab 2 can be applied to many molecular biology experimental designs using a variety of sample types and provides investigators with improved insight and interactivity during experimentation. Overall, the on orbit process of total RNA isolation and gene expression analysis is accomplished in a span of approximately 3 h without the requirement for a highly experienced user and provides a new capability to ISS that will greatly expand the limits of possible on orbit science.\n\nSuccessful development and deployment of the WetLab 2 system to the ISS depended on solving a number of challenges such as limited refrigeration availability, hazardous reagent use allowances, power consumption, and availability of crew time. In addition, the suite of hardware and fluidic components had to function in microgravity and provide ease of use for non expert operators.\n\nIn order to perform thermal cycling on orbit, a suitable, commercially available thermal cycler that was capable of operating in a microgravity environment was identified. Specifically, the Cepheid SmartCycler best met the requirements without significant modifications. The instrument is modular, has reduced power requirements and offers assay wells with individual thermal protocol programming allowing for simultaneous running of assays with different optimal primer annealing temperatures. Validation testing of this instrument included physical durability tests and validation of all 16 sample sites.\n\nTaqMan assays were selected because of the ability to multiplex assays with multiple color probes in a single tube, and because alternatives such as SYBRGreen DNA intercalating dyes are carcinogenic, resulting in safety concerns for the ISS crew and imposing elevated containment requirements.\n\nNext we developed a RNA isolation and RT qPCR workflow using non hazardous reagents suitable for room temperature storage. A RNA binding column and cell lysis system for RNA purification was selected from Claremont BioSolutions for its ease of integration [21,22]. In collaboration with Claremont, the RNA extraction protocol was modified to meet room temperature storage and low toxicity requirements. RNA extracted from the SPM proved to be of sufficient high quality and quantity for gene expression studies utilizing RT qPCR (Fig 3B). Longevity testing of loaded SPMs showed no degradation of the reagents for at least 26 weeks (S2 Text).\n\nWe proceeded to develop a lyophilized all in one detection assay to minimize crew time and storage requirements. Lacking instruments to evaluate RNA purity and potential gDNA contamination, intron spanning primers that give a product approximately 100 bases in length were used in eukaryotic samples. In prokaryotic samples, DNase enzyme [34] was included due to the lack of introns in the coding region [35]. To ensure that lyophilized assays provided similar results to those obtained using wet bench chemistry, we performed extensive validation testing. Our results indicate no significant differences between lyophilized and commercial non lyophilized assays (seeTable 2). When refrigerated, the lyophilized assays were stable with a shelf life of at least 52 weeks (S2 Text). To provide longer shelf life and room temperature storage conditions in the future, we plan to use the standard commercial caps, as they appear to perform better in initial results from ongoing long term storage tests.\n\nBefore the WetLab 2 system could be made available to researchers, the system was validated to ensure that the data obtained on orbit was not affected or biased by microgravity conditions, including surface tension dominated fluid dynamics and lack of convection [36]. Specifically, because PCR consists of repeated cycles of rapid heating and cooling, lack of gravity induced convection mixing in microgravity may limit heat transfer throughout the sample to only conduction which may require longer denaturation and annealing/extension times.\n\nTo validate PCR efficiency in microgravity, control qPCR reactions were conducted once the system was installed on orbit. These tests included validation with a range of pre prepared DNA template concentrations (low, mid and high) to assess PCR efficiency. Three replicate runs were conducted, of which two were successful in returning qPCR amplification curves that showed close correlation to 1 g controls. Furthermore, the microgravity Ct results were comparable to their respective 1 g controls (Fig 2andS1 Table). Although amplification was successful, microgravity data showed increased variability within replicate sets. Analysis of the amplification plots, post assay tube windows, and follow up experiments suggest that this increased variability may be caused by degassing bubble formation that interferes with fluorescence detection. In subsequent ground based experiments, we found that these bubbles rise out of the tube detection window under normal 1 g conditions. Conversely, in microgravity, bubbles form, are retained and expand in the tube optical window during thermocycling, creating noise (choppiness) in the resulting amplification curves. Despite higher variability when using septa caps, our data show that qPCR can be conducted in the SmartCycler using TaqMan assays in microgravity conditions, and that resulting Ct values are comparable to those of 1 g controls, albeit noisier (Fig 2G & 2H). These results indicate that the physical alterations of fluid and thermal dynamics in microgravity are not sufficient to alter enzymatic amplification of DNA during PCR thermal cycling in the SmartCycler.\n\nTo validate that the WetLab 2 system could successfully isolate RNA from intact cells and tissue, as well as perform RT qPCR analyses on orbit, we prepared and froze samples ofE.coliand mouse liver tissue on the ground. Results show that RNA was successfully isolated on orbit using the SPM and that singleplex and multiplex RT qPCR analyses from bothE.colicells and mouse liver tissues resulted in successful qPCR amplification (Fig 3andS1 Table). Successful multiplex RT qPCR allows for the use of ratiometric methods; expression of genes of interest can be measured relative to reference genes in the same tube, thereby effectively normalizing variability that may exist in RNA concentrations or other artifacts of microgravity PCR amplification.\n\nComparison of raw background fluorescence data showed significant differences between microgravity and 1 g control samples (S1 File), however, no significant differences in Ct values. In agreement with genomic DNA standards data, increased variability was also observed in the microgravity samples using SPM derivedE.coliand mouse RNA, likely due to bubble formation during thermal cycling.\n\nAs this variability in Ct values may limit the utility of the system for researchers, a follow up \"volunteer science\" experiment was conducted by astronaut Kate Rubins. This test was aimed at reducing or eliminating bubbles formed during thermal cycling and showed that the positive pressure formed in the tubes when closed using a standard cap drastically reduces bubbles and results in smooth amplification curves similar to those typically seen during RT qPCR runs in 1 g (Fig 4). This run yielded data with less variability; standard deviations up to 0.659 Ct for standard caps compared to 1.035 Ct for septa caps. Therefore, for future experiments, we intend to use standard commercial tubes to suppress degassing bubble formation.\n\nThrough these experiments, we have demonstrated that qPCR can be successfully performed in the microgravity environment of space and developed an system of molecular biology tools and reagents for extracting and quantitatively analyzing RNA from biological samples on orbit and generating RT qPCR Ct data (See photos of actual on orbit operations inFig 5).\n\nA) On orbitE.coliRNA isolation using the SPM inside the DGB, B) filling tubes using the repeater pipette, C) Rotor centrifugation using the ISS cordless drill D) SmartCycler and DGB set up.

This new capability allows investigators unprecedented flexibility with ISS research and the opportunity to re design and iterate experiments based on data received in almost real time. The WetLab2 system is publicly available to investigators for research on ISS [37] and can also potentially be used to analyze environmental samples, for medical diagnostics, or to provide purified RNA and cDNAs for expressome sequencing and global gene expression analysis using nanopore sequencing [17] as our group recently demonstrated [38]. Overall the novel molecular biology capabilities we describe here for for ISS, although trivial on earth, are an important step forward in the quest for making possible the exploration and development of space for human use.",
