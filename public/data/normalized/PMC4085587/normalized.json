    "abstract": "Low fluid shear force, including that encountered in microgravity models, induces bacterial responses, but the range of bacteria capable of responding to this signal remains poorly characterized. We systematically analyzed a range of Gram negative Enterobacteriaceae for conservation of the low shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) response using phenotypic assays, qPCR, and targeted mutations. Our results indicate LSMMG response conservation across Enterobacteriacae with potential variance in up  or down regulation of a given response depending on genus. Based on the data, we analyzed the role of thetrpoperon genes and the TrpR regulator in the LSMMG response using targeted mutations in these genes inS.Typhimurium andE. coli. We found no alteration of the LSMMG response compared to WT in these mutant strains under the conditions tested here. To our knowledge, this study is first of kind forCitrobacter, Enterobacter, andSerratia,presents novel data forEscherichia, and provides the first analysis oftrpgenes in LSMMG responses. This impacts our understanding of how LSMMG affects bacteria and our ability to modify bacteria with this condition in the future.\n\nKeywords:Enterobacteriaceae, environmental response, low shear modeled microgravity, rotating wall vessel, Salmonella Typhimurium.",
    "methods": "Cultures were grown in the RWV in LB (Lennox) broth as previously described [3,4,7]. Experimental set up with RWV cultures is depicted in Fig. (1). The RWV apparatus used was model RCCS 1 from Synthecon, Inc., Houston, TX as used in previous studies [3,4,7]. Strains used in this study were as follows:S.Typhimurium 3339 [29],E. coliTOP10 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA),E. coliMG1655 [30],E. coliDH5a (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA),E. coliAS11 [31],E. cloacaeATCC23355 [32],C. freundiiATCC8090 [32], andS. marcescensATCC14041 [33].\n\nStress Assays and qPCR\n\nAcid and oxidative stress assays were performed as previously described [3,4,7]. The qPCR reactions were performed as previously described using 16S rRNA andlpxCgenes for normalization [3,34]. DNA oligonucleotides used as primers in qPCR are provided in Table1.\n\nDNA oligonucleotides used in this study.\n\nDeletion mutations in thetrpRandtrpDEgenes were constructed using standard recombineering techniques inS.Typhimurium andE. coliand confirmed using both PCR and phenotypic indications [35]. DNA oligonucleotides used in the recombineering are provided in Table1. Briefly, PCR products were amplified from the template plasmid pKD3 using primers containing 40 bp regions of homology to the ends of thetrpRandtrpDEgenes such that deletion of the genes would be obtained. Strains containing plasmid pKD46 were electroporated with the PCR products, and colonies were selected on LB Cm medium.",
    "results": "To determine if the individual members of Enterobacteriaceae exhibited similar growth kinetics in both LSMMG and control conditions (an important parameter for comparing the two culture orientations with a given species), we grew the following members of this family in the RWV in the LSMMG and control orientations (Fig.2):S.Typhimurium ,E. coli,Enterobacter cloacae,Citrobacter freundii, andSerratia marcescens.Data obtained withS.Typhimurium have previously shown that growth in LSMMG and control conditions results in very similar kinetic profiles for this organism in LB medium [1,4,7]. Analysis of bacterial growth in the LSMMG and control conditions forE. coli, E. cloacae, C. freundii, andS. marcescensrevealed essentially identical kinetics in both environments for each organism (Fig.2). This assures that phenotypic assays performed at a given point in the growth of LSMMG and control cultures are using cells at equivalent growth phases.\n\nGrowth of Enterobacteriaceae in the RWV.PanelA: \nA representative growth curve for Enterobacteriaceae (Enterobacter cloacaeATCC23355) in the RWV for the LSMMG and control conditions in LB media, 37  degreesC. \nThe RWV apparatuses were set up and operated as shown in Fig. (1) and as \npreviously described [1, 3 5, 7]. At the indicated time points, aliquots were removed from the indicated \napparatuses, serial diluted, and plated for CFU/ml counts in triplicate. This \nexperiment was also performed forEscherichia coliTOP10,Citrobacter \nfreudiiATCC8090, andSerratia marcsescensATCC14041 with equivalent \nresults (data shown in panel B below).PanelB: Cultures of the indicated bacteria were grown in the RWV \nin the LSMMG and control conditions in LB media and samples processed as in panel A. For each time point, the ratio of CFU/ml \nLSMMG to control was calculated. The results were obtained from at least two \nindependent cultures for each strain, and the average and standard deviation are \nplotted. ForE. coli, the data shown here is for strain TOP10. StrainsE. coliMG1655,E. coliDH5 alpha, \nandE. coliAS11 displayed results equivalent to those presented here \n(data not shown).\n\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that resistance to acid and oxidative stress is altered by LSMMG inS.Typhimurium [1 5,7,33]. Therefore, we tested each genus (includingS.Typhimurium ) for these phenotypes by comparing LSMMG and control cultures for resistance to acid stress (pH=3.5, citric acid) and oxidative stress (hydrogen peroxide, 35   70 mM) (Figs.3and4). It is worth noting that acid stress resistance was tested using the conditions reported in the Wilson,et al.(2007) and Wilson,et al. (2008) references in which resistance is decreased by LSMMG inS.Typhimurium for cultures grown 24 hours which more appropriately matched spaceflight conditions involved in those studies [3,7].\n\nLSMMG mediated alteration of acid stress resistance in\nEnterobacteriaceae.The indicated strains were grown in the RWV in the LSMMG and control\nconditions for testing of acid stress resistance (pH=3.5, citric\nacid, 2 hours stress exposure) as previously described \n[3, 7]. To test survival of the stress in the LSMMG and control samples,\naliquots from each sample were removed from the stress,\nserially diluted in PBS, and plated for CFU counts on LB media. The\npercent survival of the bacteria compared to the number present at\nt=0 before addition of the stress was determined for each sample,\nand then a ratio of percent survival values was calculated and\nplotted as indicated in the graph (either control/control or\nLSMMG/control). The data was obtained from at least three\nindependent experiments each plated in triplicate, and the average\nand standard deviation are plotted. The differences between LSMMG\nand control were significant at p value\n< 0.05.\n\nOxidative stress resistance altered by LSMMG in Enterobacteriaceae.RWV cultures of the indicated strains were tested for oxidative stress resistance\n(hydrogen peroxide, 35   70 mM, 2 hours stress exposure)\nas described in Fig. (3) and as previously described\n[4, 33] The data was obtained from at least three independent experiments\neach plated in triplicate, and the average and standard deviation\nare plotted. The differences between LSMMG and control were\nsignificant at p value < 0.05.\n\nForS.Typhimurium , acid stress resistance was decreased in LSMMG as reported previously (Fig.3) [3,7]. However, under the same conditions, resistance to acid stress was increased by LSMMG forE. coli, and this result was repeated in four differentE. colistrains to ensure that strain differences did not explain the deviation from theS.Typhimurium phenotype (Fig.3). InE. cloacaeandS. marcescens, LSMMG decreased and increased acid stress resistance, respectively (Fig.3). ForC. freundii, acid stress resistance was not significantly different between LSMMG and control cultures (Fig.3). For oxidative stress resistance, LSMMG decreased resistance for all tested genera (Fig.4). These results are equivalent to previously published data forS.Typhimurium [4,33]. ForS. marcescens, oxidative stress resistance could not be tested due to the fact that this organism could not be killed by the levels of hydrogen peroxide we tested for this study (up to 175 mM for this organism).\n\nTo test for changes in gene expression induced by LSMMG in different genera, we isolated total RNA fromS.Typhimurium ,E. coli,E. cloacae, andC. freundiicultures grown at LSMMG and control conditions and analyzed gene expression using qRT PCR [3,18]. InS.Typhimurium , the expression of thehfqandtrpDgenes was decreased and increased, respectively, by LSMMG (Fig.5). This result is consistent with previously published data which identified altered expression of these genes by LSMMG using microarray analysis and qPCR [3,5,7]. InE. coli, LSMMG decreased the expression of both genes indicating that LSMMG altered gene expression in this genus, but that the direction oftrpDregulation was reversed compared toS.Typhimurium (Fig.5). This is interesting given the fact that the direction of LSMMG induced acid resistance alteration was also reversed accordingly in these two genera (Fig.3). InC. freundii,hfqexpression was also decreased by LSMMG, buttrpDexpression was not significantly altered (Fig.5). As inE. coli, thetrpDresult also correlates to the acid resistance phenotype inC. freundiiwhere LSMMG did not cause altered resistance to this stress. InE. cloacae, we did not observe alteration ofhfqexpression by LSMMG but did observe an increase in expression of theydcIgene by LSMMG (Fig.5). TheydcIresult is consistent with previously reported data which identified this gene as LSMMG regulated inS.Typhimurium [4,5]. Overall, qRT PCR analysis demonstrated that a molecular response to LSMMG resulting in gene expression changes is conserved across Enterobactericeae, but the direction of gene expression change (i.e. up or down) can potentially vary depending on genus.\n\nqRT PCR analysis to determine LSMMG induced alterations of gene expression in Enterobacteriaceae. Total RNA harvested from LSMMG and control cultures was converted to single stranded cDNA and used as template in qPCR analysis with primers hybridizing to the indicated genes as described previously [3, 18]. PCR product levels were normalized to both the 16S rRNA andlpxCgenes [3, 34], and a ratio of each gene level for LSMMG to control was calculated to give a fold difference in expression between the two samples as previously described [3]. Differences in expression between LSMMG and control samples were significant at p value < 0.05. The data was obtained from at least four qPCR reactions using RNA from at least two independent cultures for each condition, and the data is plotted as the average and standard deviation.\n\nIn the experiments above, we observed an inverse correlation between the direction of change in acid resistance by LSMMG and the direction of regulation oftrpDexpression by LSMMG inS.Typhimurium andE. coli(Figs.3,5). In addition,we observed that inC. freundii, these phenotypes correlated to eachother in that LSMMG did not induce alteration of acid stress ortrpDexpression in this species (Figs.3,5). This observation is curious since thetrpgenes are not involved in acid resistance, and the activity of the anthrylate synthase enzyme encoded by thetrpoperon is not involved in environmental stress resistance. However,inS.Typhimurium , thetrpDgene was one of the few genes in a group found to be up regulated by all low shear/micro gravity conditions tested including LSMMG in LB media [5] and by spaceflight in both LB and M9 media [3,7], and this result was observed using both microarray and qPCR analysis [3,5,7]. In addition, a study with adherent invasiveE. colishowed that a mutation in a tryptophan permease gene altered an LSMMG induced phenotype related to cell adherence, and this alteration was complemented by restoring the WT gene or by exogenous indole supplementation [28]. Taken together, the above observations provided justification to analyze the role oftrpgenes in the LSMMG response.We reasoned that the changes intrpDexpression under LSMMG could be related to a regulatory mechanism acting up stream of thetrpoperon that is responsive to and/or involved in the LSMMG response pathway. The TrpR protein is a transcriptional regulator that controls expression of thetrpoperon as well as several other genes distributed across theS.Typhimurium andE. coligenomes [36]. Since this protein regulates a global gene regulon, we viewed TrpR as a possible candidate regulatory mechanism through which the LSMMG response acts in bacteria. We therefore constructed trpRmutations inS.Typhimurium andE. coli, and we tested these mutants for display of LSMMG phenotypes (Fig.6). We found that the deletion of TrpR had no effect on the acid and oxidative stress LSMMG responses in these genera indicating that TrpR is likely not involved in the LSMMG response under the conditions tested here (Fig.6). In addition, we also considered the possibility that the anthrylate synthase enzyme encoded by thetrpoperon could be having a role in the LSMMG response. Therefore, we constructed a trpDEmutation inS.Typhimurium andE. colithat knocked out expression of this enzyme, and we tested these mutants for LSMMG phenotypes compared to WT (Fig.6). As with the trpRstrains, we observed no effect of trpDEon LSMMG responses in these genera indicating that thetrpoperon genes are not involved the LSMMG response as tested here.\n\nAnalysis of role oftrpgenes in LSMMG phenotypes.S.Typhimurium andE.colitrpRand trpDEstrains were compared to respective WT strains for LSMMG mediated alteration of \nacid and oxidative stress as described in Figs. (3,4). \nThe data was obtained from at least three independent experiments each plated in \ntriplicate, and the average and standard deviation are plotted. The differences \nbetween LSMMG and control were significant at p value < 0.05.",
    "discussion": "The results presented here provide significant evidence using several strains and multiple assays that the response to the LSMMG growth environment is conserved across Enterobacteriaceae.Thus, the pathways and mechanisms used for sensing this environmental signal appear to be present in these different cells. This report also demonstrates that in a \"side by side\" study, the direction of LSMMG induced regulation of phenotypes and gene expression can vary depending on genus. These results indicate that applications using the LSMMG environment (and related spaceflight conditions) have the potential to be targeted to a range of Entrobacteriaceae genera. Future work will focus on understanding the underlying causes of the variance in the direction of LSMMG regulation observed here and on the use of LSMMG/spaceflight to engineer bacteria in different ways.",
