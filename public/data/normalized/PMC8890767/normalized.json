    "abstract": "Intranasally administered unfractionated heparin (UFH) and other sulfated polysaccharides are potential prophylactics for COVID 19. The purpose of this research was to measure the safety and pharmacokinetics of clearance of intranasally administered UFH solution from the nasal cavity.\n\nDouble blinded daily intranasal dosing in C57Bl6 mice with four doses (60ng to 60ug) of UFH was carried out for fourteen consecutive days, with both blood coagulation measurements and subject adverse event monitoring. The pharmacokinetics of fluorescent labeled UFH clearance from the nasal cavity were measured in mice byin vivoimaging. Intranasal UFH at 2000U/day solution with nasal spray device was tested for safety in a small number of healthy human subjects.\n\nUFH showed no evidence of toxicity in mice at any dose measured. No significant changes were observed in activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), platelet count, or frequency of minor irritant events over vehicle only control. Human subjects showed no significant changes in aPTT time, international normalized ratio (INR), or platelet count over baseline measurements. No serious adverse events were observed.In vivoimaging in a mouse model showed a single phase clearance of UFH from the nasal cavity. After 12h, 3.2% of the administered UFH remained in the nasal cavity, decaying to background levels by 48h.\n\nUFH showed no toxic effects for extended daily intranasal dosing in mice as well as humans. The clearance kinetics of intranasal heparin solution from the nasal cavity indicates potentially protective levels for up to 12h after dosing.\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11095 022 03191 4.\n\nKEY WORDS:Covid 19, heparin, intranasal delivery, SARS CoV 2",
    "methods": "Heparin Sodium Injection, USP was purchased in two different formulations for human intranasal administration: 5000 USP units per mL (NDC: 71288 403 10) and 10,000 USP units per mL (NDC: 00409 2721 30). Heparin sodium salt from porcine intestinal mucosa (>= 180U/mg) was obtained from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) and used without further purification. CF680R dye was obtained from Biotium (Fremont, CA). Reagents for aPTT analysis were obtained from Pacific Hemostasis. aPTT times were measured on a KC4 coagulometer (Sigma Amelung). Other chemicals were purchased from VWR International (Radnor, PA). The U line S 20037C   1 Oz Glass Dropper Bottles with pump (100ul per spray) was provided by Brister's H & W Compounding Pharmacy, Grenada, MS.\n\nAll formulation steps were performed under a Biosafety cabinet hood in BSL 2 level laboratory. For animal studies, diluent medium was prepared using 39.6mL of sterile milliQ water, 0.4mL benzyl alcohol, and 0.36g of NaCl. The pH of the diluent was adjusted to 6.2, and the diluent solution was filtered using a 0.2um filter. A stock solution of 5mg/mL of heparin was prepared by dissolving 10.5mg of dry heparin sodium in 2mL of diluent solution. The stock solution was then serially diluted 10x using the diluent medium to prepare specified doses of heparin.\n\nFor human studies, heparin sodium injection at either 5000U/mL (NDC: 71288 402 10) or 10,000U/mL (NDC: 00406 2721 30) was transferred into glass intranasal U line S 20037C   1 Oz Glass Dropper spray bottles with a 100uL actuator (Aptar Pharma, Congers NY) under sterile conditions. The intranasal spray bottles were verified to dispense 0.1mL of heparin solution per pump.\n\nAll procedures were approved by the University of Mississippi Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol #19 009) or the University of Mississippi Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol #1571). Toxicology experiments were performed on wild type male (19 23g) and female (16 19g) C57BL6 mice from Envigo (Indianapolis, IN) in study groups of six mice for each dose (three male, three female). The study was powered to preserve an 80% chance of not committing a Type II error with a 5% chance of Type I error at significant effect sizes (weight as the variable: power>0.8 to detect a 20% change in body weight within sex (n=3), 10% change in body weight within entire group (n=6); aPTT time: power>0.8 to detect a 100% change in aPTT (n=4); buried food recovery time: power>0.8 to detect a 100% change in recovery time (n=5)). No data were excluded from analysis.\n\nIn vivoimaging experiments were performed on six (three male, three female) SKH1 Elite mice (Crl:SKH1 HrhrOutbred: Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA). One female mouse exhibited poor response to the anesthetic resulting in significant movement during imaging, so data for this mouse were excluded from the nasal clearance kinetics modeling. All animals for toxicology studies were housed in the AALAC accredited University of Mississippi Animal Facility and given access to rodent chow (Cat.# 7001, Envigo Teklad 4% Fat Rodent Diet) and tap waterad libitumfor the duration of the experiments. Mice were group housed (3 4 mice/cage) in climate controlled rooms (30 40% relative humidity, 21 23 degreesC) under a 12:12h light/dark cycle (lights on at 06:00). All mice were acclimated to the vivarium colony room for five days prior to initiating the drug administration regimen. Upon completion of the study, mice were anesthetized with vaporized isofluorane, perfused with phosphate buffer saline, and secondarily euthanized with decapitation. Tissues of interest were examined, weighed, and fixed in buffered 4% formalin. The left liver lobes were embedded in 30% sucrose (Sigma, S9378) overnight at 4 degreesC and frozen in optimal cutting temperature for cryosectioning (Leica CM 3050S) at  15 degreesC. Serial slices (10um) were transferred to superfrost coated glass slides and stained following standard H&E protocols (dehydrated with alcohol, stained in hematoxylin for 2min, rinsed, differentiated in 70% alcohol and then subsequently stained in 0.01% eosin Y for 30s, rinsed in 95% ethanol, dehydrated with absolute ethanol and cleared in three xylene washes). Entire hepatic cross sections were imaged (40x) and stitched (10% overlap) using an HCA Nikon Ti2 E microscope and assessed by a blinded observer.\n\nMice were transferred to a surgical suite each day and weighed prior to inhaled anesthesia induction with up to 5% isofluorane. Mice were then administered 6uL per nostril of Heparin solution at concentrations from 5 to 5000mg/L using a micropipette timed to inspiration. Mice were returned to their home cage and were monitored during recovery (less than 5min). Drug was administered each morning (08:00 12:00) for 14 consecutive days. Signs of inflammation, bleeding, and/or nasal discharge were monitored twice daily by visual inspection of the nose, body, cage, and bedding. Images of the nose were taken prior to administration, one week into administration, and on the 14th day of administration for further visual analyses of inflammation or irritation.\n\nThe Buried Food Test was used to assess the ability to smell volatile odors following the 14 day regimen of IN administration. Mice were habituated to the food stimulus of choice, Teddy Grahams (Nabisco, Hanover, New Jersey), at least 24 h prior to behavioral testing to confirm its rewarding stimulus. Mice were food deprived (water ad lib) immediately following Day 14 of IN drug administration to motivate subjects, and tested 24 h later (signs of distress were monitored while food deprived). On test day, the subject was placed in a test chamber containing 3cm of fresh 1/8 in corncob bedding for a 15 min trial, with the food stimulus buried approximately 1cm below the bedding surface in a randomly assigned corner of the cage. The subject successfully completed the assay when it uncovered the food stimulus and began to eat, using one or both forepaws on the food. Latency to uncover and eat the food served as the dependent measure. Each trial had a maximum latency of 900s. Immediately following testing, mice were returned to their home cage, and ad lib access to food was restored.\n\nAt the time of exsanguination, 20uL of whole blood was removed and smeared on coverglass for histological assessment. The smears were air dried and stained with Wright's Blood Stain (Fisher, #9513306), washed 3 times, and dried for microscopic imaging. Only the highest heparin dose was analyzed for platelet count. Five fields per sample were imaged at random at 600x phase contrast using a Nikon Ti2 E Microscope. Platelets in each image were counted by a blinded observer.\n\nActivated partial thromboplastin time assay (aPTT) was performed by incubating 50uL of test animal plasma with 50uL of control reference plasma. Following this, 100uL of aPTT reagent was added and the individual mixtures were further incubated for five minutes at 37 degreesC. Clotting time was measured in seconds immediately following the addition of 100uL of 25mM CaCl2. For control values, heparin was added directly to 100uL of reference plasma at a defined concentration (U/mL), aPTT reagent was added and the aPTT assay performed as described.\n\nCF680R heparin was generated by conjugating the free reducing end of heparin with the aminooxy group of the CF680R. Briefly, 50uM of heparin (EMD Millipore) stock solution was prepared in 100mM sodium phosphate and 1.5M sodium chloride (pH7.4). 5mM of CF680R (Biotium) stock solution was prepared in water. 150uL of 5mM CF680R was added to 300uL of 50uM heparin. The molar ratio of heparin and CF680R was 1:50. 45uL of aniline was added to catalyze the reaction. The mixture was reacted at room temperature overnight in the dark. The conjugate was purified by a 3kDa Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter (Millipore Sigma) at 13,000xg for 30min, followed by three washes with 400uL of water at 13,000xg for 30min. The final sample was further purified by HPLC size exclusion chromatography using a 4.6mmx300mm ACQUITY BEH SEC column (Waters). Sample was analyzed using an isocratic gradient of 40mM sodium acetate in 20% methanol at a flow rate of 100uL/min and detection by UV absorbance at 680nm.\n\nCF680R heparin (excitation maximum=680nm; emission maximum=701nm) was resuspended in 1X PBS (600ug/72ul) and administered at 1ul per nostril (1.67ug total) in the mouse anesthetized with 3% isoflurane initially and maintaining anesthesia with 1% isoflurane. Images were acquired on an IVIS Spectrum animal imager system using Living Image Software (Perkin Elmer). Images were captured before administration of heparin and at 5min, 15min, 30min, 1h, 2h, 5h, 12h, 24h, 48h, 72h and 96h post administration. Quantification was performed by manual definition of the nasal cavity followed by software quantification of IR fluorescence average radiant efficiency in the defined area. Background IR intensity was obtained pre dosing for each animal and subtracted from each time point. Each replicate was normalized to the intensity of nasal IR fluorescence measured five minutes post dose for each animal. One phase and two phase exponential decay modeling was carried out using GraphPad Prism 9.3.1 and hypothesis testing using an extra sum of squares F test was performed. As thepvalue for the comparison of fits measurement was not below 0.05 (p=0.37) and gains in the goodness of fit parameters were minimal for the two phase decay model (R2=.77 for the one phase modelversus.78 for the two phase model), the simpler model was chosen.\n\nPrior to the initiation of treatment, all mice were thoroughly examined for abnormalities and one mouse with a blunted nose was removed and replaced. Drug was assigned to the mice using block randomization for equal group size and drug doses were coded to ensure administration and outcome assessments were performed double blinded. Data were analyzed using SPSS and SyStat SigmaPlot v13 software. Normality was assessed with Shapiro Wilk test and equal variance was assessed with Brown Forsythe test. One way ANOVAs with post hoc Bonferonni tests were utilized to compare differences with a statistically significant cut off value of p<0.05. Two way ANOVAs for sex and treatment revealed a significant main effect of sex across all body weights and most tissue weights, thus each sex was considered independently.\n\nAn Early Phase 1 interventional clinical trial (NCT04490239) in a small sample population was performed under the approval and guidance of the University of Mississippi Institutional Review Board (protocol #21 004). Six volunteers (three male, three female) between the ages of 18 and 61 (mean age 31yr) were included in the non randomized exploratory study after screening ten participants in Oxford, MS (Table I). The six participants were selected based on subject availability during the preferred study dates; the remaining four were retained as replacement subjects in case of participant withdrawal. Exclusion criteria were allergy to heparin; current use of anti coagulant or anti platelet drug therapies or any intranasal medication; known history of anemia, thrombocytopenia or other blood disorder; autoimmune disorders; known history of neurologic/psychiatric disorders; reports of any active infection; or subject is pregnant, breast feeding or is expecting to conceive during the study. All female volunteers were tested for pregnancy via HCG test during each blood draw; no tests returned positive for pregnancy at any point during the study. All subjects submitted written informed consent prior to enrollment in the study. At baseline, all volunteers had clinically normal aPTT (24 33s) and INR values (0.8 1.2), along with clinically normal platelet counts (150000 450,000 platelets/uL). All participants completed the entire course of the study. This study was not randomized, as all participants received the intranasal heparin intervention.\n\nAdministration was carried out in two phases: an acute phase to determine tolerability of two doses, and a chronic phase to determine tolerability of repeated daily doses using U line nasal spray bottle with pump over a two week period. During the acute phase, volunteers applied a single spray of 500U to each nostril on Day 1 in the clinic and volunteers were observed for one hour for adverse events. Whole blood was drawn by venipuncture 24h after dosing to allow for aPTT measurement. If the aPTT value remained in the clinically normal range, volunteers applied a single spray of 1000U to each nostril on Day 3 in the clinic. Again, aPTT was measured 24h post dosing. No differences in aPTT levels were observed at either dose in the acute phase, thus all participants entered the chronic phase of the intervention. A five day washout period was used between the acute phase and the chronic phase.\n\nDuring the chronic phase, each volunteer had a single 1000U heparin spray per nostril administered on Day 1 in the clinic, and the subject was observed for adverse events. Subjects were instructed on how to self administer the heparin dose, and subjects were given the test article to self administer daily at home. Volunteers maintained a dosing journal to document self administration. Follow up calls were made on Day 4, Day 7, Day 9 and Day 11 to check on subject compliance, response and adverse events. Blood was drawn after the final dose on Day 14 in the clinic for aPTT measurement. Blood was drawn 24h after the final dose, on Day 15, and two weeks following completion of the study (Day 30) for aPTT, PT/INR and platelet count measurements. All hematological assays were performed by a contract medical testing lab. Results were registered withclinicaltrials.gov(NCT04490239). No changes were made to methods or assessment criteria after trial commencement.",
    "results": "Varying doses of heparin or vehicle control were administered to the nasal cavities of male and female mice once per day for 14 consecutive days to monitor safety and tolerability with this route of administration. Block randomization was used to assign dosing groups of 5mg/L (0.06ug/day), 50mg/L (0.6ug/day), 500mg/L (6ug/day), and 5000mg/L (60ug/day) heparin formulated in 5mg/mL sodium chloride, 1% benzyl alcohol (pH5.0 7.5). 12uL (6uL/nostril) were administered daily via drop pipetting into the nasal cavity during inspiration. Notes were taken on animal appearance, grooming, signs of distress, and other notable behaviors twice daily throughout the treatment period. Detailed results are shown in Supplementary Table1. As expected with this developmental stage, both cohorts of male and female mice exhibited small weight gains over the 14 day drug treatment. Two way multiple comparison ANOVA indicated a main effect of sex on weight, but no treatment effect when all groups were compared. When sex was considered independently, a one way ANOVA revealed no difference in the extent of weight gain between any of the treatment doses in females (p>0.05). In males, between group differences were observed and a post hoc Bonferonni test revealed a statistically significant increase in weight gain in mice treated with 6ug/day heparinversusvehicle only control (mean: 1.33g gain vs 0.33g gain, p=0.018). No differences in the weights of mice receiving lower or higher doses were observed (Fig.1).\n\nSample results from 14day toxicology trial of intranasal heparin in mice. Images of representativeA.vehicle control andB.60ug/day mouse nose after two weeks.C.Change in body weight from pre dose to after the 14th day dose\n\nMinor nasal discharge, minor nose wetness, dried nasal residue, and sneezing or nasal bubbling upon administration were observed in both test and vehicle only groups. Minor irritation (pink discoloration) and minor swelling of the nose was observed in a few animals throughout the 14day protocol, with no differences in prevalence across groups. Only one mouse (male, 6ug/day heparin) showed irritation on more than one day of the study and the three days of observed irritation were non consecutive and ended on day 10. No signs of epistaxis or topical bleeding were evident in any mice during the study (Fig.1). Overall, the frequency of observed minor effects for heparin dosed animals were small and consistent between males and females (0.29+/ 0.07 events per day for males, 0.29+/ 0.10 events per day for females). No dose dependence was observed in the frequency of minor effects for heparin dosed animals (Fig.2). The frequency of observed minor effects in vehicle only control animals in males (0.22+/ 0.10 events per day) or females (0.49+/ 0.14 events per day) was not significantly different from heparin dosed animals (p>0.05), suggesting the minor irritation may be attributed to the technical aspects of inspiration timed intranasal administration in young mice.\n\nDose dependence of frequency of minor observations reported for 14 day heparin trial in mice. No dose dependence in the frequency of minor observations (nasal discharge, dried nasal residue, mild nasal discoloration, etc.) was observed, and no difference between heparin dosed and vehicle only control animals were observed\n\nNecropsies were performed at the completion of the drug treatment paradigm with no overt pathology noted across all mice. The wet weights of heart, lungs, liver, spleen, and both kidneys were compared. The only significant difference in wet organ mass observed compared to vehicle only control was a decrease in liver mass in females receiving the 6ug/day dose (0.22g decrease; p=0.0207). When normalized to total body weight, one way ANOVA analysis with post hoc Bonferroni test revealed a small but significant decrease in relative liver:body mass ratio weight in females at 0.6ug/day (0.0127g decrease, p=0.0009), 6ug/day (0.0131g decrease, p=0.0007) and 60ug/day (0.0112g decrease, p=0.0022). Histological assessments of the 6ug/day and control females revealed no evidence of hepatotoxicity or neoplasia. No significant change was found in liver:body mass ratio for any individual dose in males. All necropsy data are presented in Supplementary Table1. Whole blood was sampled upon completion of the 14day dosing regimen and platelet count at this time point revealed no significant difference across all treatment groups (p=0.766, Fig.3), indicating no signs of heparin induced thrombocytopenia.In vitroanalysis of coagulation time of plasma isolated at this time point also revealed no significant difference in aPTT across all treatment groups (Fig.4), indicating no clinically significant systemic bioavailability of daily administered intranasal heparin. As expected, inclusion of 1U/mL and 0.5U/mL exogenous heparin in thein vitroaPTT test as a positive control resulted in significant differences (p<0.0001) in aPTT clotting time (Fig.4), thereby supporting the efficacy of the aPTT assay.\n\nBlood platelet count after 14days of daily administration of 60ug of intranasal heparin in mice. No significant difference in platelet count was observed (p=0.766)\n\naPTT assay of mouse plasma after 14 day heparin trial. No significant differences in aPTT clotting time was observed between heparin at any doseversusvehicle only. Significant differences were observed between vehicle only and the vehicle plasma with exogenous heparin added directly at concentrations of 1U/mL or 0.5U/mL (p<0.0001)\n\nTo assess whether repeated intranasal administration disrupted olfactory function, the buried food test was performed after the final drug administration with the saline and 60ug/day heparin treatment groups (Fig.5). Control nave mice who did not receive any intranasal treatments were also assessed to determine whether physical administration to the nose each day altered the behavioral phenotype. All mice successfully uncovered the food reward, with no significant difference in the latency to complete the task between any group (one way ANOVA, p=0.2387). One outlier was observed in the 60ug/day group with an unusually long time to retrieve the buried food; the subject dug at the location of the food after 43s, but waited to retrieve it. Overall, no evidence of overt toxicity, intolerability, or systemic bioavailability of intranasal heparin was observed in the mice during the two week dosing period at any dose, up to 60ug/day.\n\nBuried food retrieval anosmia assay of nave, vehicle only, and 60ug/day heparin in mice. No significant differences were observed between groups (p=0.2387)\n\nOf key concern in any therapeutic strategy involving nasal administration of heparin to block viral attachment and entry to nasal epithelial cells is the pharmacokinetics of heparin clearance from the nasal cavity. Unlike residence in the lungs (29), the mucosa of the nasal cavity is constantly cleared into the stomach which can drive intranasal drug clearance. However, heparin has many physical and chemical features that are not common in nasally administered drugs, being much larger and having high negative charge density. To test the lifetime of heparin in the nasal cavity, we labeled heparin at the reducing end with a near IR chemical dye through an oxime linkage, resulting in a single dye molecule (95Da) per heparin molecule (avg. ~15,000Da). After purification, the resulting CF680R heparin showed no substantial presence of unconjugated dye by analytical size exclusion chromatography (Fig.6A). The resulting CF680R heparin has biophysical characteristics almost identical to unmodified heparin, while having quantitative near IR fluorescence that can be imaged in the living mouse. Due to the intensity of the signal, we administered a dose of 1.67ug of CF680R heparin to the mouse and quantified the fluorescence signal in the nasal cavity. A comparison of fits test failed to show a statistically significant improvement in model quality for a two phase model (p=0.37), with a one phase exponential decay model fitting the observed data well (Fig.6B). The observed half life of the heparin in the nasal cavity was 39.34min (95% CI 22.7 66.6min). At the goal of 12h protection time post dose, we retain ~3.2% of the initial heparin dose in the nasal cavity. Based on an average mouse nasal cavity volume of 32mm3(30) and an initial dose of 60ug found to be safe for repeated daily dosing in mice, our model indicates we should retain 60mg/L heparin in the nasal cavity after 12h, 10,000 times higher than the heparin IC50measured for inhibiting pseudotyped SARS CoV 2 attachment and entry (9). Movement of the fluorescence signal is consistent with passage through the nasopharynx and into the digestive tract during mucus clearance (Fig.6C).\n\nIn vivoimaging of 1.67ug of nasally administered CF680R heparin in mice.(A)Analytical size exclusion chromatography verifies that purification has removed nearly all free dye, resulting in all IR fluorescence signal coming from CF680R heparin.(B)Clearance from the nasal cavity follows a one phase exponential decay (black line; 95% CI shown as red dotted line) to reach background IR levels (normalized to zero); K=0.01762, Y0=1.070, half life =39.34min. Signal is normalized to the measured radiant efficiency at 5min.(C)In vivoimaging shows accumulation and residence in the nasal cavity, with clear evidence of clearance through the gut\n\nHeparin was administered to six healthy human volunteers (three male, three female) in two phases. The initial acute phase was performed at two intranasal doses (1000U/day and 2000U/day administered as one spray per nostril daily) to monitor for acute adverse effects. No adverse effects were reported during the acute phase, so the chronic phase was performed at 2000U/day administered as one spray per nostril daily to monitor for longer term effects after fourteen consecutive days of daily dosing. Effects of intranasal heparin on blood coagulation parameters were followed via an aPTT test 24h after each dose in the acute phase, as well as immediately after the final dose in the chronic phase, 24h after the final dose in the chronic phase, and 16days after the final dose in the chronic phase (16day washout period). An INR test was also performed 24h after the final dose in the chronic phase, as well as 16days after the final dose in the chronic phase. In all cases, no evidence of systemic bioavailability of heparin was observed based on changes in blood coagulation times compared to the pre study screening results or the clinically normal range (Fig.7A and B). Platelet counts were also performed during pre study screening, immediately after the final dose in the chronic phase, 24h after the final dose in the chronic phase, and 16days after the final dose in the chronic phase. No evidence of heparin induced thrombocytopenia was observed based on changes in platelet count compared to pre study values or clinically normal ranges (Fig.7C). Subjects also reported mild adverse events, summarized in TableI. Two subjects reported mild nasal irritation and/or sneezing after administration, consistent with exposure to the benzyl alcohol found in the heparin formulation. One subject reported spontaneous brief epistaxis during sedentary time on Day 7 of the chronic phase, as well as seven days after the last dose of the chronic phase. Follow up questioning indicated that this subject had a history of epistaxis that was undisclosed during screening. These early Phase 1 results support that heparin administered intranasally is tolerableat doses up to 2000U/day for at least 14days, with no clinically significant systemic distribution of the heparin and no effect on blood coagulation.\n\nBlood results from intranasal heparin human subjects.

No dose dependence in the frequency of minor observations (nasal discharge, dried nasal residue, mild nasal discoloration, etc.) was observed, and no difference between heparin dosed and vehicle only control animals were observed Necropsies were performed at the completion of the drug treatment paradigm with no overt pathology noted across all mice. The wet weights of heart, lungs, liver, spleen, and both kidneys were compared. The only significant difference in wet organ mass observed compared to vehicle only control was a decrease in liver mass in females receiving the 6ug/day dose (0.22g decrease; p=0.0207). When normalized to total body weight, one way ANOVA analysis with post hoc Bonferroni test revealed a small but significant decrease in relative liver:body mass ratio weight in females at 0.6ug/day (0.0127g decrease, p=0.0009), 6ug/day (0.0131g decrease, p=0.0007) and 60ug/day (0.0112g decrease, p=0.0022). Histological assessments of the 6ug/day and control females revealed no evidence of hepatotoxicity or neoplasia. No significant change was found in liver:body mass ratio for any individual dose in males. All necropsy data are presented in Supplementary Table 1 . Whole blood was sampled upon completion of the 14day dosing regimen and platelet count at this time point revealed no significant difference across all treatment groups (p=0.766, Fig. 3 ), indicating no signs of heparin induced thrombocytopenia. In vitro analysis of coagulation time of plasma isolated at this time point also revealed no significant difference in aPTT across all treatment groups (Fig. 4 ), indicating no clinically significant systemic bioavailability of daily administered intranasal heparin. As expected, inclusion of 1U/mL and 0.5U/mL exogenous heparin in the in vitro aPTT test as a positive control resulted in significant differences (p<0.0001) in aPTT clotting time (Fig. 4 ), thereby supporting the efficacy of the aPTT assay.

Open in a new tab aPTT assay of mouse plasma after 14 day heparin trial. No significant differences in aPTT clotting time was observed between heparin at any dose versus vehicle only. Significant differences were observed between vehicle only and the vehicle plasma with exogenous heparin added directly at concentrations of 1U/mL or 0.5U/mL (p<0.0001) To assess whether repeated intranasal administration disrupted olfactory function, the buried food test was performed after the final drug administration with the saline and 60ug/day heparin treatment groups (Fig. 5 ). Control nave mice who did not receive any intranasal treatments were also assessed to determine whether physical administration to the nose each day altered the behavioral phenotype. All mice successfully uncovered the food reward, with no significant difference in the latency to complete the task between any group (one way ANOVA, p=0.2387). One outlier was observed in the 60ug/day group with an unusually long time to retrieve the buried food; the subject dug at the location of the food after 43s, but waited to retrieve it. Overall, no evidence of overt toxicity, intolerability, or systemic bioavailability of intranasal heparin was observed in the mice during the two week dosing period at any dose, up to 60ug/day.

No significant differences were observed between groups (p=0.2387)\n\nIn Vivo Imaging of Instranasal Heparin Clearance Kinetics Of key concern in any therapeutic strategy involving nasal administration of heparin to block viral attachment and entry to nasal epithelial cells is the pharmacokinetics of heparin clearance from the nasal cavity. Unlike residence in the lungs ( 29 ), the mucosa of the nasal cavity is constantly cleared into the stomach which can drive intranasal drug clearance. However, heparin has many physical and chemical features that are not common in nasally administered drugs, being much larger and having high negative charge density. To test the lifetime of heparin in the nasal cavity, we labeled heparin at the reducing end with a near IR chemical dye through an oxime linkage, resulting in a single dye molecule (95Da) per heparin molecule (avg. ~15,000Da). After purification, the resulting CF680R heparin showed no substantial presence of unconjugated dye by analytical size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 6A ). The resulting CF680R heparin has biophysical characteristics almost identical to unmodified heparin, while having quantitative near IR fluorescence that can be imaged in the living mouse. Due to the intensity of the signal, we administered a dose of 1.67ug of CF680R heparin to the mouse and quantified the fluorescence signal in the nasal cavity. A comparison of fits test failed to show a statistically significant improvement in model quality for a two phase model ( p =0.37), with a one phase exponential decay model fitting the observed data well (Fig. 6B ). The observed half life of the heparin in the nasal cavity was 39.34min (95% CI 22.7 66.6min). At the goal of 12h protection time post dose, we retain ~3.2% of the initial heparin dose in the nasal cavity. Based on an average mouse nasal cavity volume of 32mm 3 ( 30 ) and an initial dose of 60ug found to be safe for repeated daily dosing in mice, our model indicates we should retain 60mg/L heparin in the nasal cavity after 12h, 10,000 times higher than the heparin IC 50 measured for inhibiting pseudotyped SARS CoV 2 attachment and entry ( 9 ). Movement of the fluorescence signal is consistent with passage through the nasopharynx and into the digestive tract during mucus clearance (Fig. 6C ). Fig. 6. Open in a new tab In vivo imaging of 1.67ug of nasally administered CF680R heparin in mice. (A) Analytical size exclusion chromatography verifies that purification has removed nearly all free dye, resulting in all IR fluorescence signal coming from CF680R heparin. (B) Clearance from the nasal cavity follows a one phase exponential decay (black line; 95% CI shown as red dotted line) to reach background IR levels (normalized to zero); K=0.01762, Y 0 =1.070, half life =39.34min. Signal is normalized to the measured radiant efficiency at 5min. (C) In vivo imaging shows accumulation and residence in the nasal cavity, with clear evidence of clearance through the gut\n\nTolerability of Intranasal Heparin in Healthy Human Volunteers Heparin was administered to six healthy human volunteers (three male, three female) in two phases. The initial acute phase was performed at two intranasal doses (1000U/day and 2000U/day administered as one spray per nostril daily) to monitor for acute adverse effects. No adverse effects were reported during the acute phase, so the chronic phase was performed at 2000U/day administered as one spray per nostril daily to monitor for longer term effects after fourteen consecutive days of daily dosing. Effects of intranasal heparin on blood coagulation parameters were followed via an aPTT test 24h after each dose in the acute phase, as well as immediately after the final dose in the chronic phase, 24h after the final dose in the chronic phase, and 16days after the final dose in the chronic phase (16day washout period). An INR test was also performed 24h after the final dose in the chronic phase, as well as 16days after the final dose in the chronic phase. In all cases, no evidence of systemic bioavailability of heparin was observed based on changes in blood coagulation times compared to the pre study screening results or the clinically normal range (Fig. 7A and B ). Platelet counts were also performed during pre study screening, immediately after the final dose in the chronic phase, 24h after the final dose in the chronic phase, and 16days after the final dose in the chronic phase. No evidence of heparin induced thrombocytopenia was observed based on changes in platelet count compared to pre study values or clinically normal ranges (Fig. 7C ). Subjects also reported mild adverse events, summarized in Table I . Two subjects reported mild nasal irritation and/or sneezing after administration, consistent with exposure to the benzyl alcohol found in the heparin formulation. One subject reported spontaneous brief epistaxis during sedentary time on Day 7 of the chronic phase, as well as seven days after the last dose of the chronic phase. Follow up questioning indicated that this subject had a history of epistaxis that was undisclosed during screening. These early Phase 1 results support that heparin administered intranasally is tolerableat doses up to 2000U/day for at least 14days, with no clinically significant systemic distribution of the heparin and no effect on blood coagulation.

    "conclusion": "Our results demonstrated that UFH produces no local nor systemic adverse effects when administered intranasally to either mice or human volunteers. We observed no signs of nasal inflammation, epistaxis, alterations on platelet count that could lead to potential heparin induced thrombocytopenia, and significant changes on the aPTT analysis. Our findings revealed no overt signs of toxicity nor disruption of olfactory functions in mice administered UFH intranasally over two weeks at doses up to 60ug/day. From the findings ofin vivoimaging, we observed a two phase clearance of intranasal UFH from the nasal cavity, with protective concentrations still present 12h post dosing, in which approximately 2% of the starting dose remained in the cavity until background levels were again reached after 12 additional hours. No significant changes were observed for aPTT, PT/INR, and platelet counts in human volunteers, indicating that intranasal administration of heparin is tolerable at doses up to at least 2000U/day for at least 14days. The lack of both local irritation and systemic bioavailability suggest that intranasal heparin may have a high tolerance with a potentially large therapeutic window for preventing viral infections from respiratory viruses that use heparan sulfate as a co receptor, including SARS CoV 2."
