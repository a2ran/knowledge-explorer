    "abstract": "An imaging system was refined to monitor the health of vegetation grown in controlled conditions using spectral reflectance patterns. To measure plant health, the singleimage normalized difference vegetation index (SINDVI) compares leaf reflectance in visible and nearinfrared light spectrums.\n\nThe SINDVI imaging system was characterized to assess plant responses to stress before visual detection during controlled stress assays. Images were analyzed using Fiji image processing software and Microsoft Excel to create qualitative false color images and quantitative graphs to detect plant stress.\n\nStress was detected inArabidopsis thalianaseedlings within 15 min of salinity application using SINDVI analysis, before stress was visible. Stress was also observed during ammonium nitrate treatment ofEruca sativaplants before visual detection. Early detection of plant stress is possible using SINDVI imaging, which is both simpler to use and more cost efficient than traditional dualimage NDVI or hyperspectral imaging.\n\nKeywords:early stress detection, imaging, plant health monitoring, vegetation index",
    "methods": "A detailed benchside protocol for development and use of the SINDVI imager in controlled plant stress assays is available in Appendix1.\n\nA GoPro Hero4 Black camera (GoPro Inc., San Mateo, California, USA) was retrofitted with a BackBone Ribcage AIR modification kit (BackBone Gear Inc., Ottawa, Canada) to create the SINDVI imager (Fig.1). This camera contains a 12megapixel (MP; 4000 x 3000 pixel) CMOS optical sensor. The BackBone system allows for the removal of the internal infrared blocking filter and addition of the ability to accept varied lenses. The lens used in this study is an M12 5.4mm MP10 with infrared correction. A singlefilter lens with dual bandpass was added (NDVI7; IRpro, Brea, California, USA) that allowed light to transmit in the 400 575nm range and the 675 775nm range. The quality of the images taken can be varied based on intrinsic camera setting options, which include 5 MP, 7 MP, and 12 MP. Camera settings were kept consistent and calibrated to produce the most meaningful data for a given experiment. The Protune settings, optimized for use in our work, on the GoPro Hero4 Black camera were as follows: white balance = 6500 K, color = flat, ISO min = 100, ISO max = 100, sharpness = high, and EV comp = 0.0. These settings produced the images that provided greatest manipulation options in data analysis. It should be noted that it is important to manually lock the white balance and color settings, instead of using autocorrect settings, to prevent discrepancies between images in downstream analysis.\n\nPhotograph of the disassembled singleimage normalized difference vegetation index (SINDVI) imager.

(C) The M12 5.4mm MP10 with infrared correction lens used in this study.\n\nA Heliospectra LX300 lighting system (Heliospectra AB, Gteborg, Sweden) was used for all SINDVI imaging. This system allows for application of 450 nm (blue), 660 nm (red), 735 nm (far red/NIR), and 5700 K (white) LEDs. Additionally, each of the LED light spectra is individually adjustable with this system, thus maximizing customizability. For all experiments in this report, NIR (735 nm) and blue light (450 nm) were supplied to the plant tissue. The exact composition of light wavelengths used (as recorded by an external spectrometer) is provided in a spectral graph (Fig.2).\n\nSpectral graph demonstrating composition of light wavelengths used in this study for singleimage normalized difference vegetation index (SINDVI) analysis. This exact light spectrum was obtained utilizing a customizable controlled lighting source allowing for application of both nearinfrared and blue light to plant tissue. Spectral readings taken from under a typical fluorescent growth light are provided for comparison.\n\nAfter image collection, the photographs from the SINDVI imager can be analyzed qualitatively to produce false color images. Application of the Photo Monitoring plugin (Horning,2012) of Fiji is used to begin the photo processing (Schindelin etal.,2012). The Photo Monitoring graphical user interface (GUI) allows for different options that can be optimized for user needs, including selection of channels for the NDVI equation (Horning,2012). Selecting the blue channel in place of the traditionally used red band, and the red channel in place of the NIR band, enables the SINDVI calculation. Proper channel selection in the Photo Monitoring GUI of Fiji is imperative to SINDVI analysis using the NDVI7 filter because NIR reflectance is recorded in the red channel of the camera. The following SINDVI equation will be applied to each individual pixel in the image of interest:\n\nTo produce a false color image, a color index file must first be generated from the raw SINDVI image. The color index file retains the SINDVI score calculated for each individual pixel and divides the scores into 256 categories termed \"color index values.\" SINDVI scores range from  1.0 to 1.0; therefore, each color index value category corresponds to an increment of 0.0078125 in SINDVI scores. Using this increment system, a score of  1.0 will be categorized to color index value 0, a score of 0.0 to color index value 127, and a score of 1.0 to color index value 255. False color images are then generated by applying a color lookup table (LUT) to the color index file. LUTs are adjustable, artificially generated color scales that can be set to meet the needs of the user in terms of highlighting pixels with specific color index values in distinct colors. False color images are produced by using the following settings in the Photo Monitoring plugin when applying a LUT: select the option to stretch the NIR band before creating the index, then set the minimum index value for scaling color index image to  1.00 and the maximum to 1.00.\n\nOptimal visual presentation in the false color image is achieved through choice of LUT and the ability to optimize the balance and contrast between colors in any given LUT. Although selection of a color LUT impacts the aesthetic characteristics of a false color image, the selection of one LUT over another has no bearing on the categorization of pixel scores (Fig.3). To demonstrate the ability to highlight pixels with highscoring color index values in varying colors, multiple LUTs were applied to an image ofNicotiana benthamianaDomin (Fig.3D F). For example, when using the \"Jolly Green Cyant\" LUT, a pixel with a score of  1.00 will be categorized to color index value 0 and colored white, whereas a pixel with a score of 1.00 will be categorized to color index value 255 and colored dark orange (Fig.3F). For comparison, when using a different LUT such as \"Physics,\" a pixel with an SINDVI score of  1.00 will similarly be categorized to color index value 0, but colored dark blue instead (Fig.3E) (Horning,2012). A variety of LUTs are included in the Photo Monitoring plugin upon initial download (Horning,2012), and more are available online for download (https://github.com/nedhorning/PhotoMonitoringPlugin/tree/master/downloads). Additionally, users can design custom LUTs (Balor,2004) such as the \"NDVI Cyantific\" and \"Jolly Green Cyant\" LUTs, which were specifically customized for this work (Fig.3D, F, respectively; LUT files available in AppendicesS1andS2).\n\nApplication of lookup tables (LUTs) to a filtered normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) image for qualitative data analysis has no impact on quantitative analysis.

(C) Plot of the color index value for all pixels in the filtered image shown in panel B. Three LUT color scales are shown below thexaxis to demonstrate that LUT selection has no bearing on pixel score categorization. (D F) Various LUTs applied to the same filtered image ofN. benthamianashown in panel B. (D) NDVI Cyantific LUT. (E) Physics LUT. (F) Jolly Green Cyant LUT.\n\nIn addition to false color images, the same SINDVI image can be used to generate a graph that displays the number of pixels present at each pixel value. For graph production, the same channel settings are used as previously described in the process of generating false color images. To generate graphs with less background from nonvegetative material, the settings in the Photo Monitoring GUI can be adjusted to highlight only vegetative data. This is accomplished by exclusively categorizing pixels with an SINDVI score between 0.00 and 1.00, which is done by reducing the increment per color index value category to 0.00390625. All pixels with a score lower than 0.00 are categorized to color index value 0 using this approach. Categorized data are then graphed to examine the number of pixels that were assigned to each color index value (Figs.3C,4C D,5C D). Additionally, pixels barely surviving the 0.00 cutoff (color index value 25 and below) are removed from the data set before graphing to focus exclusively on vegetative tissue. Larger color index values seen on thexaxis reflect higher SINDVI scores, whereas higher peaks indicate highly concentrated color index values as reflected on theyaxis (Figs.3C,4C D,5C D). Plant health or growth can then be studied by analyzing changes in the curve over time.\n\nSingleimage normalized difference vegetation index (SINDVI) analysis enables early detection of salt stress inArabidopsisplants, prior to white light visible detection. (A, B) Images taken throughout duration of salt stress (A) or control (B) treatments. White light images were taken with a normal camera (scale bar = 1 cm), filtered images taken with the SINDVI imager, and finally the NDVI Cyantific LUT was applied to the filtered images for qualitative data analysis (LUT scale shown between panels A and B).

C=control treatment; N = ammonium nitrate stress treatment.\n\nSalt treatments ofArabidopsisHeynh. seedlings were used to demonstrate the potential of early stress detection using SINDVI analysis. Sterilized wildtypeArabidopsis thaliana(L.) Heynh. Columbia0 seeds were planted onto square 10cm2Petri plates containing 0.5% (w/v) Phytagel (SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA). Media was prepared using 2.2 g of Murashige and Skoog (MS) salts, 0.5 g of MES hydrate, 5.0 g of sucrose, 1.0 mL of Gamborg vitamins (SigmaAldrich), and then adjusted to pH 5.72 with 1 M KOH. The media was solidified with 0.5% (w/v) Phytagel (SigmaAldrich). Seeds were sown in densities ranging from 18 to 36 seeds per Petri plate. For any individual experiment, plates containing the same density of seeds were used for experimental and control treatments. Petri plates were sealed with porous surgical 3M Micropore tape (3M, Maplewood, Minnesota, USA). Plants were grown for 10 19 d under 24h fluorescent growth lights. For any individual experiment, plates containing plants of the same age were used for the experimental and control treatments.\n\nAt the start of the stress experiments, both control and treatment plates were acclimated to the Heliospectra LX300 lighting for 2 3 h before administering treatment. Both the SINDVI imager and the normal white light camera were set up using tripods and scheduled to image the plants every 15 min for 24 h. After the acclimation period and the initial images were taken, stress or control treatments were applied to the plants. For the salt stress treatment, 7 10 mL of 3% salt water was applied to the Petri plate to flood the roots, taking care not to flood the leaves. For the control treatment, 7 10 mL of Millipore deionized water was applied to the roots.\n\nPlants treated with salt stress showed little difference to the naked eye 15 min after salt treatment was administered (Figs.4,6). However, in the SINDVI images, stress is detectable in the plants given the salt treatment. After only 15 min of salt exposure, color changes are seen in the false color images of the saltstressed plants compared to the control plants (Fig.4A, B). This decline in health could also be detected by quantitative image analysis, seen by the decrease in the number of pixels with a high color index value, correlating to a high SINDVI score, in stressed plants compared to control plants over time (Fig.4C, D).\n\nSingleimage normalized difference vegetation index (SINDVI) analysis is capable of repeatedly detecting statistically significant salt stress responses before visual detection. Pixel counts in color index values 115 125 from a total of eight ROI replicates were summed for the initial time point before treatment application, as well as 0.25, 1, 9, and 21 h after treatment. Color index values 115 125 correspond to the peak decrease in SINDVI scores over time as seen in Fig.4. Pictured below the graph are white light images of two single plants from a single replicate, chosen as visual representatives of the control or stress treatments. * indicates a statistically significant difference calculated by Student'sttest (P< 0.05). C = control treatment; S = salt stress treatment.\n\nStatistical significance was calculated by cropping the images obtained from each replicate into smaller regions of interest (ROIs). For this experiment, eight ROIs were included in the calculation of significance from two biological replicates. The ROIs chosen were nonoverlapping to ensure that any individual plant was only included in a single ROI. Analysis as previously described for graph production was performed on each smaller ROI individually. After this analysis, the numbers of pixels assigned to color index values 115 125 were summed for each individual ROI. The summed pixel counts from all ROIs were then represented graphically using a boxandwhisker plot (Fig.6), and twotailed Student'sttests assuming equal variances were calculated for comparison between control and stress treatments at each individual time point (Table1). Statistics were calculated using both the data analysis tool in Excel and the t.test() function in R with identical results. Color index values 115 125 were chosen for statistical calculation because the primary decrease seen in color index values over time occurs in this range (as seen in Fig.4C). At the initial time point, there was no statistically significant difference between the number of pixels assigned to color index values 115 125 in the control and salt stress treatment groups. After only 15 min of salt stress exposure, however, the number of pixels categorized to color index values 115 125 was significantly lower in the saltstressed plants than in the control treatments (Fig.6). A single plant from both the control and salt stress treatments was chosen as a visual representative (Fig.6). The background has been subtracted in the representative images for clarity.\n\nStatistical values obtained from singleimage normalized difference vegetation index (SINDVI) analysis of anArabidopsis thalianasalinity stress experiment over a 16h period.a\n\nStatistics were calculated using summed pixel counts from color index values 115 125 from eight nonoverlapping regions of interest per treatment, using twotailed Student'sttests assuming equal variances.\n\nAmmonium nitrate treatments ofE. sativaMill. (arugula) plants on soil were used to demonstrate the potential of early stress detection in a more productionrelated growth situation. Sterilized commercial arugula seeds (Arugula Myway no. 67165A; W. Atlee Burpee & Co., Warminster, Pennsylvania, USA) were sown on round, deepwelled Petri plates 10 cm in diameter containing 0.5% (w/v) Phytagel prepared as described for theArabidopsisseedlings. Arugula seeds were allowed to germinate on plates for 7 d before transplantation to sterile soil in sixwelled pots, with one arugula seedling transplanted per well. Arugula plants were exposed to 24h fluorescent growth lights both during germination on plates and growth on soil. Plants were allowed to grow for a total of 25d before use for ammonium nitrate assays.\n\nBefore application of the ammonium nitrate treatment, the arugula plants were allowed to acclimate to the Heliospectra LX300 lighting overnight. Both the SINDVI imager and the normal white light camera were set up using tripods and scheduled to image the plants every 30 min for 3 d. After acclimation, an initial image was taken prior to administering stress or control treatments. Each sixwelled pot was placed in an individual plastic tray to contain treatment solutions. For both the treatment and control plants, 200 mL of solution was applied to each sixwelled pot by pouring the solution into the plastic tray and allowing the solution to reach the plant through the soil. For the ammonium nitrate treatment, 10x ammonium nitrate solution was utilized based on the recommended concentration of ammonium nitrate in basal Murashige and Skoog medium. For the control treatment, tap water was utilized.\n\nFor several days after stress treatment, arugula plants subjected to the ammonium nitrate solution do not appear visibly stressed (Fig.5A). Finally, after 60 h of exposure to the high ammonium nitrate concentration, the plants become noticeably wilted, whereas control plants look relatively unchanged (Fig.5A, B). Despite the lack of change in the visual appearance of the ammonium nitrate treated plants, SINDVI quantitative analysis in comparison to control plants enables detection of a decrease in high scoring color index values, correlating to a decrease in healthy plant tissue, as early as 6 h after stress treatment (Fig.5C, D).\n\nAnalysis was done on a single leaf from five different arugula plants per treatment following the previously described method for graph production. For each time point analyzed, the color index value with the highest pixel count was recorded and termed the \"peak color index value.\" The peak color index value of each successive time point was then subtracted from the peak color index value at the initial time point before treatment application for each individual arugula leaf analyzed, and the difference was termed the \"peak color index value change.\" The color index value changes were then represented graphically in a boxandwhisker plot (Fig.5E), and twotailed Student'sttests assuming equal variances were calculated on the peak color index value change at each time point (Table2). Statistics were calculated using both the data analysis tool in Excel and the t.test() function in R with identical results. By 12 h of treatment exposure, the peak color index value change in the ammonium nitrate treated plants was statistically significantly different from the peak color index value change in the control plants (Fig.5E).\n\nStatistical values obtained from singleimage normalized difference vegetation index (SINDVI) analysis ofEruca sativaammonium nitrate stress experiment over a 60h period.a\n\nStatistics were calculated using the peak color index value change of five leaflocalized regions of interest from five individual plants per treatment, using twotailed Student'sttests assuming equal variances. Peak color index value change refers to the difference between the color index value with the highest pixel count for a given time point and the color index value with the highest pixel count at the initial time point.",

    "conclusion": "Compared to traditional NDVI or hyperspectral imaging approaches, the dollar cost of implementing an SINDVI imaging system is low because SINDVI requires only one camera and can rely on completely free, open source software for analysis. In addition, the implementation barriers within a laboratory setting or greenhouse facilities are essentially nonexistent. To optimize SINDVI imaging to be similar to the historical NDVI applications, precise application of light in the blue and NIR spectrums can be supplied using controlled lighting (Fig.2). In our study, this was accomplished through the use of programmable LED lighting. Alternatively, NDVI cameras have been developed to function in natural lighting, such as the smart NDVI camera developed by Dworak and colleagues (Dworak etal.,2013). This study demonstrated that SINDVI imaging allows for detection of plant stress before it is apparent to the human eye, in controlled conditions using two of the many potential stresses that may be of interest in the laboratory or greenhouse. This work has demonstrated that the SINDVI imaging system is capable of enabling detection of stress inArabidopsisseedlings within 15 min of exposure to salt on agar plates (Figs.4,6) and in young arugula plants on soil within 6 h of exposure to high concentrations of ammonium nitrate.\n\nWhen cultivating crops in controlled conditions, it is especially desirable to detect stress early to improve the overall success rate of cultivation. SINDVI imaging has clear applications in the development of indoor farming practices, which are increasingly relied upon to provide fresh food to geographical areas not conducive to crop cultivation, such as in urban cities or areas of extreme temperature. Additionally, SINDVI imaging could potentially be used as a highthroughput screening technique for identification of mutant phenotypes in controlled laboratory plant studies.\n\nHence, the implementation of SINDVI will likely improve the success of controlled greenhouse or laboratory growing efforts, and should be tested further. This work has characterized an SINDVI response curve corresponding to saltstressed agargrownArabidopsisseedlings and ammonium nitrate stressed soilgrown arugula plants. Future research should work toward characterizing SINDVI phenotypes for additional plant stressors, species, and growth mediums. Furthermore, future work should address practical concerns associated with deploying the SINDVI method in realworld controlled crop cultivation efforts."
