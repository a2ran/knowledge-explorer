    "abstract": "The on going Microbial Observatory Experiments on the International Space Station (ISS) revealed the presence of various microorganisms that may be affected by the distinct environment of the ISS. The low nutrient environment combined with enhanced irradiation and microgravity may trigger changes in the molecular suite of microorganisms leading to increased virulence and resistance of microbes. Proteomic characterization of twoAspergillus fumigatusstrains, ISSFT 021 and IF1SW F4, isolated from HEPA filter debris and cupola surface of the ISS, respectively, is presented, along with a comparison to experimentally established clinical isolates Af293 and CEA10. In depth analysis highlights variations in the proteome of both ISS isolated strains when compared to the clinical strains. Proteins that showed increased abundance in ISS isolates were overall involved in stress responses, and carbohydrate and secondary metabolism. Among the most abundant proteins were Pst2 and ArtA involved in oxidative stress response, PdcA and AcuE responsible for ethanol fermentation and glyoxylate cycle, respectively, TpcA, TpcF, and TpcK that are part of trypacidin biosynthetic pathway, and a toxin Asp hemolysin. This report provides insight into possible molecular adaptation of filamentous fungi to the unique ISS environment.\n\nKeywords:Aspergillus fumigatus, proteome, the International Space Station",
    "methods": "Procedures to isolate and identifyA. fumigatuscollected from the ISS were described previously45. In brief, HEPA filter associated particulates were scraped, resuspended in sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) and spread onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates22. Cupola surfaces were sampled with sterile polyester wipes assembled at Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) prior to space flight. After each sampling event on board the ISS, wipes were returned to JPL for subsequent processing. During that process, two of multiple isolates were identified via ITS region and subsequently whole genome sequencing (WGS) asA. fumigatus.\n\nAf293, CEA10, ISSFT 021 and IF1SW F4 were cultivated for 5 days at 30 degreesC on glucose minimal medium (GMM) agar plates (6 g/L NaNO3, 0.52 g/L KCl, 0.52 g/L MgSO47H2O, 1.52 g/L KH2PO4, 10 g/L D glucose, 15 g/L agar supplemented with 1 mL/L of Hutner's trace elements) covered with cellophane membrane. Each Petri plate (D=10 cm) was inoculated with 10*106spores/plate. For supplementary comparison, each strain was also cultured in potato dextrose (PD, BD Difco, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and Czapek dox (CD, BD Difco) liquid media for 2 days and 10 days, respectively.\n\nMycelia and spores from GMM agar plates were collected. The hyphae from the liquid media were collected on Whatman paper filter and washed with cell culture grade water. All samples were stored at  80  degreesC prior to protein extraction. The lysis buffer consisted of 100 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB) with 1:100 Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) and 200 ug phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The hyphae from the liquid media were first homogenized on ice using a Polytron (Kinematica AG, Bohemia, NY) with a speed setting of 5 for 3 5 times (1 min/time, 30 sec pause). Subsequently, the crude homogenates were subjected to a Precellys 24 homogenizer (Bertin, Rockville, MD) in which each sample was processed inside a 2 mL cryotube with 0.5 mm glass beads three times (at 4  degreesC, 6500 rpm, 1 min., repeated 3 times with 15 sec pauses in between). Mycelia from GMM were homogenized directly by bead beating due to their small volume. The lysed fungi were centrifuged at 17,000 g for 15 min. Protein concentrations in the supernatants were measured by Bradford assay (Bio Rad Laboratories, Inc. Hercules, CA).\n\n200 ug proteins from each group were TCA precipitated. Obtained protein pellets were washed with ice cold acetone, and resolubilized in 25 uL TEAB (100 mM) and 25 uL 2,2,2 trifluoroethanol (TFE). Subsequently, proteins were reduced with tris(2 carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP, 500 mM), alkylated with iodoacetamide (IAA) and digested overnight using mass spec grade trypsin/lysC (Promega, Madison, WI) at 37 degreesC. The digested peptides were quantified using the Pierce Quantitative Colorimetric Peptide Assay (Thermo Scientific). 40 ug of peptides from each specific sample was labeled with the Thermo Scientific TMTsixplex Isobaric Mass Tagging Kit (Af293 with TMT6 126, CEA10 with TMT6 127, ISSFT 021 with TMT6 128, and IF1SW F4 with TMT6 130) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The TMT6 131 label was used as a reference that contained an equal amount of peptides from each of the samples. All labeled peptide mixtures were combined into a single tube, mixed, and fractionated into eight fractions using the Thermo Scientific Pierce High pH Reversed Phase Peptide Fractionation Kit. The fractionated samples were dried using a SpeedVac concentrator and re suspended in 1% (v/v) formic acid prior to LC MS/MS analysis.\n\nAn Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer with the Thermo EASY nLC ion source, 75 um x 2 cm Acclaim PepMap100 C18 trapping column, and 75 um x 25 cm PepMap RSLC C18 analytical column was used to analyze the samples. Peptides were eluted at 45 degreesC with a flow rate of 300 nL/min over a 110 min gradient, from 3 30% solvent B (100 min), 30 50% solvent B (3 min), 50 90% solvent B (2 min), and 90% solvent B (2 min). The solvent A was 0.1% formic acid in water and the solvent B was 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile.\n\nThe full MS survey scan (m/z 400 1500) was acquired at a resolution of 120,000 and an automatic gain control (AGC) target of 2x105in the Orbitrap with the 50 ms maximum injection time for MS scans. Monoisotopic precursor ions were selected for fragmentation with charge states 2 7, within a +/ 10 ppm mass window, using a 70 s dynamic exclusion function. MS2scans (m/z 400 2000) were performed using the linear ion trap with the 35% CID collision energy. The ion trap scan rate was set to \"rapid\", with an AGC target of 4x103, and a maximum injection time of 150 ms. Subsequently, ten fragment ions from each MS2experiment were subjected to an MS3experiment. The MS3scan (m/z 100 500) generated the TMT reporter ions in the linear ion trap using HCD at a 55% collision energy, a rapid scan rate and an AGC target of 5x103, and a maximum injection time of 250 ms.\n\nThe Proteome Discoverer (version 2.1.0.81, Thermo Scientific) with searching engines Sequest HT against anA. fumigatusAf293 protein database from NCBI containing 9845 non redundant sequences was used to search all MS/MS spectra. The following parameters: 5 ppm tolerance for precursor ion masses and 0.6 Da tolerance for fragment ion masses were selected. The static modification settings included carbamidomethyl of cysteine residues, whereas dynamic modifications included oxidation of methionine, TMT6plex modification of lysine  amino groups and peptide N termini, and acetyl modification of peptide N terminus. A false discovery rate (FDR) of 1% for peptides and proteins was obtained using a target decoy database search. The reporter ions integration tolerance was 0.5 Da while the co isolation threshold was 75%. The average signal to noise threshold of all reporter peaks was greater than 10. The sum of all detected reporter ions of associated peptides from a protein was used to determine the total intensity of a reporter ion for that protein. The ratios between reporter and the reference reporter ions (TMT6 131) were used to estimate the abundance ratio of each protein. For the statistical analysis, the sum of reporter ion intensities for each protein was Log2 transformed and technical triplicate measurements for each protein were averaged. Only the proteins that were identified with at least one peptide detected in each technical replicate, and quantified in all three technical replicates, were considered for the analysis. One way ANOVA was performed to identify proteins that are differentially expressed. Proteins with p value <= 0.05 were further evaluated for up  and down regulation using a cut off value of >= +/ 1 fold (Log2) change.",
    "results": "Proteins with altered abundance in ISS isolated strains ISSFT 021 and IF1SW F4, and clinical isolates Af293 and CEA10, were investigated upon extraction of total protein from each strain. Extracted proteins were digested into peptides and labeled using tandem mass tags (TMT), fractionated, and analyzed via LC MS/MS followed by spectrum/sequence matching usingA. fumigatusAf293 protein database (NCBI). The abundance ratios of all identified proteins were normalized to Af293, that enabled identification of 553, 464 and 626 increased and 314, 289 and 317 decreased in abundance proteins in CEA10, ISSFT 021 and IF1SW F4 strains respectively (Table S 1,Figure S 1). When compared to both, Af293 and CEA10, 60 proteins showed increased and 32 decreased abundance in space strains only (fold change (FC) > |2|) (Table S 2). AspGD GO Slim terms46were used to study the distribution of differentially abundant proteins in space strains. Analysis of proteins with increased abundance revealed involvement of 14 proteins in carbohydrate metabolic processes, eight in stress responses, five in secondary metabolism and toxins biosynthesis, and two in pathogenesis whereas five, three, one and zero proteins showed respectively decreased abundance in these categories. Proteins associated with cellular amino acid metabolic process (6), lipid cellular homeostasis (3), metabolic processes (2), pathogenesis (2), and translation (2) exhibited increased abundance in space strains only (Figure 1). FungiDB47was used to carry out GO term enrichment analysis to gain a general understanding of biological processes possibly affected by unique environment of the ISS. The results revealed that significantly over represented up regulated biological processes included secondary metabolic processes (40% of all up regulated proteins), carbohydrate metabolic processes (23%), and response to chemical (~15%), whereas significantly over represented down regulated processes included carbohydrate metabolic processes (15%), response to heat (6%), and mRNA metabolic processes (6%) (Table S 3).\n\nDifferentially expressed proteins in ISSFT 021 and IF1SW F4 are categorized into GO Slim categories using AspGD. Categories containing at least 2 up  or down regulated proteins are presented.\n\nThe proteomic analysis revealed altered abundance of proteins involved in secondary metabolism (Table 1). Proteins involved in trypacidin biosynthetic pathway, including emodin O methyltransferase TpcA (AFUA_4G14580), glutathione S transferase TpcF (AFUA_4G14530), and dehydratase TpcK (AFUA_4G14470)48 50, were at least threefold more abundant in ISS isolated strains than in clinical isolates. Arp1 (AFUA_2G17580), a scytalone dehydratase involved in conidial pigment biosynthesis51 53was threefold more abundant, whereas Asp hemolysin (Asp HS; AFUA_3G00590)54was eight times more abundant in ISS strains.\n\nProteins involved in secondary metabolism and toxin biosynthesis that revealed increased or decreased abundance\n\nLog2 fold change of CEA10, ISSFT 021, and IF1SW F4 compared to Af293 (P < 0.05)\n\nTo confirm observed up regulation of proteins involved in the trypacidin biosynthesis secondary metabolite profiles of the clinical and ISS isolates were acquired using high performance liquid chromatography photodiode array detection mass spectroscopy (HPL DAD MS) analysis. Examination of the production yields of monomethylsulochrin, the final intermediate in trypacidin biosynthesis, (trypacidin is not detectable until 7 8 days of growth50) showed ~600% and ~200% increased production in ISSFT 021 ad IF1SW F4, respectively (Figure S 2). Additionally, proteome of clinical and ISS strains was examined in liquid CD and PD media and confirmed significant up regulation of AspHS (Table S 4). Lastly, observed differences in sporulation capacity between the strains do not seem to be directly correlated with conidiaassociated protein expression levels (Figure S 3), suggesting that the observed variations are due to exposure to space environment rather than different growth rates.\n\nAmong proteins with altered abundance, 11 were involved in the stress response ofA. fumigatus(Table 2). AFUA_5G11430, a quinone oxidoreductase, and Pst2 (AFUA_1G02820), an NADH quinone oxidoreductase, involved in oxidative stress response were three and four times more abundant in space strains. Erythromycin esterase, AFUA_1G05850, and 3' exoribonuclease AFUA_2G1598056were at least twofold more abundant in ISS strains. Among proteins with decreased abundance several were heat shock proteins including Scf1 (AFUA_1G17370)57,58, and Awh11 (AFUA_6G12450)56. Other down regulated protein was dehydrin like protein DprA (AFUA_4G00860) that is known to play a role in oxidative stress response59.\n\nProteins involved in stress response that revealed increased or decreased abundance\n\nLog2 fold change of CEA10, ISSFT 021, and IF1SW F4 compared to Af293 (P < 0.05)\n\nComparative analysis of proteomes of ISS isolated strains, IF1SW F4 and ISST 021, with clinical isolates CEA10 and Af293 revealed changes in abundance of proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolic processes (Table 3). Pyruvate decarboxylase PdcA (AFUA_3G11070), which catalyzes the first step in anaerobic conversion of pyruvate to ethanol60, was about three times more abundant in space strains when compared to clinical isolates. Proteins involved in glycerol metabolism, including glycerol dehydrogenase GldB (AFUA_4G11730), and glycerol kinase AFUA_4G1154055were at least 2.5 fold more abundant in ISS isolated strains. AFUA_5G10540 and AFUA_1G02140, which are homologues ofA. nigerAn14g04190 and GdbA (An01g06120)61, respectively, and involved in glycogen biosynthesis and metabolism were at least twofold more abundant. Protein abundance of AFUA_3G08470, AFUA_4G08880, AFUA_7G_01830, and AFUA_1G14710 involved in glucose metabolism, increased twofold at minimum. Both, the 14 3 3 family protein ArtA (AFUA_2G03290)62and malate synthase AcuE (AFUA_6G03540)63were threefold more abundant when compared to clinical isolates. At minimum twofold increased abundance of phosphoketolase (AFUA_3G00370) and hexokinase HxkA (AFUA_2G05910)64was observed. Among the decreased in abundance proteins were hydrolase Exg17 (AFUA_6G14490)65and beta 1,3 glucan modifying enzyme Sun1 (AFUA_7G05450)66.\n\nProteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism that revealed increased or decreased abundance\n\nLog2 fold change of CEA10, ISSFT 021, and IF1SW F4 compared to Af293 (P < 0.05)",
    "discussion": "The proteome ofA. fumigatushas been studied under various conditions, including short 67, and long term hypoxia68, following exposure to antifungal agents like amphotericin B69, and voriconazole70, and during different developmental stages58. However, in this report we present unique proteome differences observed in the two ISS isolated strains when compared to clinical isolates. To date, there is no report which elucidates the molecular response of filamentous fungi to the distinct environment of the ISS, despite previous reports of their presence on board of the ISS22and Mir27,71. In depth understanding of alterations triggered in the proteome of omnipresentA. fumigatusremains imperative for astronauts' health, as it is an opportunistic pathogen that affects individuals with impaired immune system functions41.\n\nBoth ISS isolatedA. fumigatusstrains displayed higher abundance of several proteins involved in trypacidin biosynthesis. Trypacidin is a potent mycotoxin produced byA. fumigatusconidia. It has been shown to have cytotoxic activity against A549 alveolar lung cells suggesting its importance during the infection76. Further, it has been reported thatA. fumigatusconidia with disrupted production of trypacidin exhibit higher susceptibility to macrophage clearance49. Increased abundance of proteins involved in biosynthesis of trypacidin in both ISS isolated strains may be possible cause of the reported increased virulence in the larval zebra fish model of both ISS isolated strains when compared to clinical isolates45. Moreover, emodin and questin, precursors of trypacidin, are pigmented anthraquinones that have been reported to have a protective effect against UV in other organisms (Xanthoria elegansandCetraria islandica) that produce these types of compounds50,77. It is therefore reasonable to assume that up regulation of trypacidin production may be another adaptation to the enhanced irradiation environment of the ISS, however this hypothesis has to be validated by further experiments.\n\nFurther, the level of Asp HS, which is a known toxin produced byA. fumigatus54,78was highly increased in both ISS isolates. While several studies have reported its hemolytic79and cytotoxic80,81activities in the past, a recent report showed lack of attenuated virulence when Asp HS gene was deleted82. This discrepancy may be strain specific as the studies used differentA. fumigatusstrains to carry out the experiments or related to experimental models used in both studies, as at times results observed forin vitroanalyses do not correlated with the outcomes observed inin vivostudies. The exact role of Asp HS in the pathogenicity remains to be determined during future studies. Nonetheless, increased abundance of Asp HS observed in both ISS isolated strains appears to be a part of theA. fumigatusadaptation response to the unique ISS environment.\n\nOne of the increased in abundance proteins in ISS isolatedA. fumigatusstrains was Arp1, which is one of the six enzymes involved in the DHN melanin production51 53. Arp1 disruption resulted in production of reddish pink conidia with induced C3 binding that led to phagocytosis and killing of conidial spores during infection51,52. Increased abundance of Arp1 protein may, therefore, be another cause of the previously reported increased virulence in the larval zebra fish model45. Additionally, higher AlbA abundance, involved in DHN melanin production72, was observed in JSC 093350089A. nigerisolated from the ISS73. Seemingly, both ISS isolated species,A. fumigatusandA. niger, responded with increased melanin production to enhanced irradiation on board of the ISS. This observation is in agreement with previous reports of increased melanin production in fungi isolated from high radiation environments such as the Chernobyl Power Plant accident sites or \"Evolution Canyon\"74,75. However, because none of the other enzymes involved in the melanin biosynthesis showed increased abundance when compared to both clinical isolates simultaneously, further assessment of melanin production is necessary to definitively conclude its increased production under ISS conditions.\n\nProteome analysis of both ISS isolatedA. fumigatusstrains revealed altered levels of proteins involved in oxidative stress response. ArtA, a regulatory protein, was reported to be increased in abundance in response to incubation with H2O2, suggesting its importance in overcoming oxidative stress62. Pst2, which is also present inCandida albicansandSaccharomyces cerevisiae, was shown to be induced in response to oxidative stress83,84. Additionally, Pst2 was reported to be a post translational modification target protein that is ubiquitinated under peroxide stress conditions inC. albicans85. Interestingly, such post translational modifications play a role in several cellular processes in eukaryotes, including cell growth regulation and environmental adaptation, suggesting their importance in gaining survival advantage86. These data are in agreement with previous reports of induced oxidative stress response in humans, mice and yeast while in space87 91. Overall, increased abundance of proteins involved in oxidative stress response was also observed inAcinetobactersp. Ver3 when exposed to UV irradiation92and JSC 093350089A. niger73. Although increased abundance of several oxidative stress correlated proteins was observed in this study, it was previously reported that ISS isolated strains were more resistant than Af293 to H2O2exposure, but less resistant than CEA10, suggesting no adaptation45.\n\nAmong the more abundant proteins in both ISS isolated strains several were involved in carbohydrate metabolism. Malate synthase AcuE (AFUA_6G03540) is one of the three key enzymes involved in glyoxylate cycle63, which has been shown to be crucial for fungal growth on C2compounds and fatty acids as a sole carbon source93. In our earlier study it was documented that these two ISS isolated strains significantly outgrew both clinical isolates45. Further, more abundant PdcA (AFUA_3G11070), a pyruvate decarboxylase, has been shown to be involved in ethanol fermentation60. These data therefore suggest possible adaptation ofA. fumigatusto low nutrient environment of the ISS20,22, which is in agreement with changes observed in proteome ofA. fumigatusduring starvation94. Similarly, up regulation of proteins involved in starvation response was observed in ISS isolated JSC 093350089A. niger73.\n\nThis study presents comparative proteomic analysis of two ISS isolatedA. fumigatusstrains, ISSFT 021 and IF1SW F4 when compared to clinically established isolates Af293 and CEA10. Such comparison has enabled the identification of possible adaptation responses to the unique microgravity environment of the ISS, which includes increased abundance of stress response related proteins, and modulation of proteins involved in carbohydrate and secondary metabolism. To our knowledge this is the first report that focused on studying the proteomic changes in filamentous fungus isolated from on board of the ISS. Complex analyses of possible molecular alterations triggered by microgravity and enhanced irradiation will be pertinent to the future long term manned space flights, as such an understanding is crucial for astronauts' health and biodeterioration of the closed habitat.\n\nThe mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE95partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD008517.",
