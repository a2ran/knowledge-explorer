    "abstract": "Skeletal muscles overcome terrestrial, gravitational loading by producing tensile forces that produce movement through joint rotation. Conversely, the microgravity of spaceflight reduces tensile loads in working skeletal muscles, causing an adaptive muscle atrophy. Unfortunately, the design of stable, physiological bioreactors to model skeletal muscle tensile loading during spaceflight experiments remains challenging. Here, we tested a bioreactor that uses initiation and cessation of cyclic, tensile strain to induce hypertrophy and atrophy, respectively, in murine lineage (C2C12) skeletal muscle myotubes. Uniaxial cyclic stretch of myotubes was conducted using a StrexCell (STB 1400) stepper motor system (0.75Hz, 12% strain, 60min day^ 1). Myotube groups were assigned as follows: (a) quiescent over 2  or (b) 5 day (no stretch), (c) experienced 2 days (2dHY) or (d) 5 days (5dHY) of cyclic stretch, or (e) 2 days of cyclic stretch followed by a 3 day cessation of stretch (3dAT). Using  sarcoglycan as a sarcolemmal marker, mean myotube diameter increased significantly following 2dAT (51%) and 5dAT (94%) vs. matched controls. The hypertrophic, anabolic markers talin and Akt phosphorylation (Thr308) were elevated with 2dHY but not in 3dAT myotubes. Inflammatory, catabolic markers IL 1, IL6, and NF kappaB p65 subunit were significantly higher in the 3dAT group vs. all other groups. The ratio of phosphorylated FoxO3a/total FoxO3a was significantly lower in 3dAT than in the 2dHY group, consistent with elevated catabolic signaling during unloading. In summary, we demonstrated proof of concept for a spaceflight research bioreactor, using uniaxial cyclic stretch to produce myotube hypertrophy with increased tensile loading, and myotube atrophy with subsequent cessation of stretch.\n\nSubject terms:Cell biology, Physiology",
    "methods": "We used a commonly used immortal cell line (C2C12) (American Type Culture Collection; Manassas, VA, USA) derived from mouse skeletal muscle, generously provide by Dr. James Fluckey's Muscle Biology Laboratory at Texas A&M University. C2C12 cells were capable of differentiation and are a widely used model to study differentiated skeletal muscle cells. The C2C12 myoblasts were cultured in a 10 cm2 chamber filled with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, growth medium (DMEM+NA Pyruvate), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 degreesC and 5% CO235,73.Once the myoblast cultures reached 60 65% confluency, the myoblasts were then trypsinized and re cultured in 4 well 2 cm2silicone chambers coated by laminin at 37 degreesC and 5% CO2, using 1ml per well. Once the cells reached 70 80% confluency, myotube differentiation was initiated by switching to differentiation medium DMEM ( ) NA Pyruvate, supplemented with 2% horse serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 0.4% insulin transferrin selenium. To study the effects of increased and decreased mechanical stress in C2C12 myotubes, we maintained myotubes on laminin coated silastic membrane and initiated stretch through a StrexCell system, then observed the effects of stretch and cessation of stretch on cellular responses34. Twelve hours after beginning differentiation, the myotube silicone chambers were exposed to the uniaxial stretching using the StrexCell unit. The differentiation medium was refreshed daily under sterilized conditions.\n\nCyclic stretch of skeletal muscle cell cultures or \"myotubes\" has been used to mimic the loading pattern of skeletal muscle induced hypertrophy and atrophy74. However, several limitations for the FlexCell system that could impair compatibility for research in spaceflight, including the necessity of a powerful vacuum pump, considerable weight, and difficulty generating true uniaxial stretch. StrexCell uses a stepper motor and modular contractile cartridges to generate uniaxial stretch on muscle fibers mounted on the silastic membrane. StrexCell is automated and computer controlled, which enables precise control of the strain levels on the cells, providing a consistent stretch at high and low frequencies of 1 20%.\n\nMyoblasts and myotubes on a StrexCell system were exposed to uniaxial stress/tensile loads and release of tensile loading. While the myotubes were not free floating, they are plated on laminin that simulates the extracellular matrix/endothelium normally attached to muscle fibers surrounding myocytes. The myoblast and myotubes were then suspended in an aqueous medium, which induces equal pressure on all sides. At the micron level, gravity is a relatively weak force compared with adhesions, ion affinity, intermolecular forces, and fluid dynamics, especially in an aqueous medium that surrounds the myoblasts and myotubes. Importantly, adhesion to laminin allows controlled levels of uniaxial stretch to be exercise on myotubes that simulates tensile loading in an aqueous environment.\n\nWe used a StrexCell STB 1400 (B Bridge International, Inc., Cupertino, CA, USA) to apply a cyclic uniaxial stretch on C2C12 myotubes (Fig.5a). The stretch instrument employs a computer controlled stepper motor to drive two metal frames apart. A flexible silicone chamber was attached to both frames, and the chamber was stretched and released in a programmable sinusoidal oscillation. STB 1400 includes a 10cm2stretch chamber model (Culture area: 3.2x3.2x1.0cm), which supports up to 6 chambers simultaneously. The C2C12 cells (2x105cells) were seeded in silicon stretch chambers coated with laminin (Fig.5a). The amount of strain experienced by the myotubes was measured as the percent change in the stretch from the starting position (Fig.5b). Based on the preliminary validation experiments and the published report of Soltow, et al. (2013)35, the strain program was set at 0.7Hz frequency, 12% stretch using a sinusoidal wave pattern for 1hour/day for 2 or 5 days. Exposure to the uniaxial cyclic stretching was utilized to induce hypertrophy with increased loading. Conversely, cyclic stretch cessation was deemed off transient unloading to induce myotube atrophy release of cyclic tensile loads, with replicate control cultures maintained under quiescent conditions with no applied cyclic strain.\n\naSTB 1400 10 model: Automated Cell uniaxial stretching system including silicone chamber ((STB CH 10) 10cm stretch chambers, C2C12 myotubes in growth medium), and the static controls (chambers outside the system).bCyclic stretch and cessation protocol timeline and sampling periods.cStrain programs rage between 1 20% at frequencies between 1 60 cycle/min using a sine wave pattern.\n\nTwenty four hour old myotubes were used at the commencement of this experiment. Five different groups were assigned (n=4/group): (a) 2 days no stretch controls (no Stretch 2d), (b) 5 days no Stretch controls (no Stretch 5d), (c) 2 days cyclic stretching (1h/d) (2dHY), (d) 5 days cyclic stretching (1h/d) (5dHY), (e) 2 days cyclic stretching (1h/d) + 3 days cessation of stretching (3dAT). Myotubes cultures were collected at the end of each group protocol to be fixed for immunofluorescence imaging or homogenized using lysis buffer for western blot analysis.\n\nImmunofluorescence imaging was performed to observe cell morphology. C2C12 myotubes were fixed in a 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution for 30min at 4 degreesC. Then, the myotubes were washed three times with 1X PBS. Cell membranes were solubilized for intracellular assays using a 0.5% Triton X 100 for 3min until washed with 1X PBS. Myotubes were blocked with 1X PBS with 0.05% Tween20 and 5% goat serum for 30min at RT. Myotubes were then incubated with beta sarcoglycan (membrane marker) primary antibody (1:200 beta sarcoglycan mouse mAb, abcam, Cat # ab55683) for 1h at RT, and subsequently washed with 1X PBS (3x5min). Myotubes were then incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody (1:250 goat anti mouse IgG, Alexa Flour 488, ThermoFisher, Cat # A 11029) for 1h at RT, followed by washing with 1X PBS (3x5min) and then counterstaining with 1ug/ul DAPI. After washing with 1X PBS (3x5min) and then double distilled water (2x5min), slides were mounted with antifade mounting medium (ProLong Gold Antifade, Invitrogen, cat #P36930). Myotubes immunofluorescence staining was visualized using a Leica SP8 confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica SP8 Confocal Lightning GPU based Deconvolution (20X, zoom 2.25, emission wavelength 450 500nm) in the Texas A&M Image Analysis Core Laboratory. Images were analyzed using Leica LAS X softwarev.4.3 and NIH ImageJ (Fiji. ImageJv.1.53k) software for fiber diameter assessment and nucleus quantification.\n\nProtein abundance was as described by Lawler et al. (2021)4and determined by Western immunoblot analysis. The whole cell lysate was collected using TRIS HCL lysis buffer for 30min at 4 degreesC. The protein concentration was measured using Bradford assay using a microplate reader (Beckman Coulter DTX 880 Multimode Detector). Twenty ug of protein samples were loaded on SDS PAGE gels and electrophoresed at 120V for 75min using a Bio Rad Protein III gel box onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio Rad: Hercules, CA). The membranes were then blocked in a non fat milk buffer (5% non fat milk in TBS) for 1h. Following blocking, membranes were incubated overnight (4 degreesC) in a blocking buffer with the appropriate primary antibodies: Anabolic signaling (anti total Akt (rabbit mAb; 1:500; Cell Signaling Cat# 4691S), anti Akt phosphorylation at Thr308 (rabbit pAb; 1:500; Cell Signaling Cat# 9271S), anti Talin (rabbit mAb; 1:500; Cell Signaling Cat# 4021); Catabolic signaling with anti Foxo3a (rabbit mAb; 1:500; Cell Signaling Cat# 12829S) and anti phospho Foxo3a at Ser473 (rabbit pAb; 1:300; Cell Signaling Cat# 9464L); inflammatory markers anti IL 1beta (rabbit mAb; 1:1,000; Cell Signaling, Cat #12703), anti IL 6 (rabbit mAb; 1:1,000; Cell Signaling, Cat #12912), and anti P65 (mouse mAb; 1:500; abcam, Cat# ab32536). Then, the membranes were washed with T TBS (3x5min) and incubated with the secondary antibody for 1h at 4 degreesC.\n\nProteins were visualized using Clarity Western ECL Substrate (BioRad, cat# 1705061) enhanced chemiluminescence detection and developed using a Cytiva Amersham ImageQuant 800 Western Blot Imaging System (Cytiva). Quantification was performed by ImageQuant TL10v.10.2 and NIH ImageJ software with Ponceau S staining serving as a loading control.\n\nCalpain activity was performed using a Calpain Activity Assay Fluorometric Kit (Abcam # ab65308) according to the manufacturer's instructions, using 20ug of the whole cell lysate (mixed with lysis buffer provided with the kit). Calpain activities for each sample were expressed as relative fluorescence units (RFUs) per milligram of protein per minute (RFU/ug/min). The fluorescence signal was detected at 400nm excitation and 505nm emission using a microplate reader (Beckman Coulter DTX 880 Multimode Detector).\n\nResults were collected and processed for statistical analysis using Prism 9.0 (GraphPad). One way ANOVAs with Tukey's post hoc analysis was performed to distinguish among group mean differences and between the different variables with significance set atP<0.05. A nested ANOVA design was used to quantify myotube diameter.\n\nFurther information on research design is available in theNature Research Reporting Summarylinked to this article.",
    "results": "To study the effects of cyclic stretch and cessation of stretch on skeletal muscle myotube morphology and size, we used C2C12 mouse lineage myoblasts to generate myotubes, and mounted on laminin.beta sarcoglycan immunofluorescence positive staining was used as a membrane marker to calculate the myotube diameter as a marker of hypertrophy and atrophy (Fig.1). Confocal immunofluorescence quantification revealed a significant increase of 51% and 94% in mean myotube diameter following 2 and 5 days of a cyclic stretch, compared to the 2 day and 5 day quiescent controls, respectively (Fig.1b). When myotubes underwent three days without cyclic stretch in myotubes, following 2 days of cyclic stretch, then myotube diameter was 32% lower compared to the loaded, stretched myotubes (Fig.1b). Quantification of the total nuclei population per field revealed a significant reduction as a result of 2 and 5 days of cyclic stretching compared to the controls (Fig.1c), indicating an increase in fiber size while the nuclear number was relatively static. The fusion index was found to be increased significantly by the 2, and 5 days stretching protocol compared with quiescent controls (Fig.1d). However, three days of cessation of daily bouts of cyclic stretch (3dAT), did not alter the fusion index compared to the 2 days cyclic stretching.\n\naConfocal fluorescence staining images for C2C12 myotubes.

Myotubes were divided into the following groups (n=4/group): 2 days quiescent control (no stretch (2d), 5 days quiescent control (no stretch (5d), 2 days cyclic stretch (2dHY), 5 days cyclic stretch (5dHY), and 2 days of cyclic stretch followed by a 3 day cessation of stretch (3dAT).

The median of the data is indicated by the central line.\n\nWe then determined the effects of (1) uniaxial cyclic stretching and (2) release from or cessation of daily bouts of cyclic stretch on markers of protein synthesis and proteolysis commonly used in muscle atrophy and hypertrophy studies35,38,39. Protein abundance of the focal adhesion complex and cytoskeletal protein talin was chosen as a muscle hypertrophy marker, while the activity of calpains was chosen as a proteolytic marker (Fig.2). Our findings revealed that both 2 and 5 days of cyclic stretching significantly elevated the levels of talin protein compared to the control levels (Fig.2a). There was no statistically significant difference between 2 and 5 days of stretch on talin protein levels.\n\naProtein abundance for talin protein levels.

The boxplots illustrate the interquartile range (25th 75th percentiles) displayed with whiskers spanning from the 10th to the 90th percentiles. The median of the data is indicated by the central line.\n\nHowever, three days of cessation of daily bouts of cyclic stretch (3dAT) resulted in a significantly lower level of talin than 2 and 5 days of daily cyclic stretch. Talin protein levels were not statistically different from quiescent myotubes that experienced no daily stress and strain due to stretch.\n\nIn contrast, calpain activity that was measured by fluorescence revealed a significant increase in activity in the 2dHY and 5dHY groups, indicating that daily bouts of cyclic stretch elevated calpain levels and presumably remodeling (Fig.2b). Myotubes that completed stretch cessation myotubes displayed calpain levels that were not statistically different than the no stretch and 2dHY groups. Calpain activity was significantly lower in the 3dAT group vs. 5dHY myotubes.\n\nThe Akt activation pathway has been involved in regulating muscle hypertrophy and atrophy. To reveal the effects of daily cyclic stretch and subsequent cessation of daily bouts of cyclic stretch, we measured total Akt, phosphorylated Akt at Thr308, total protein levels for FoxO3a, phosphorylated FoxO3a, and the p FoxO3a/total FoxO3a ratio (Fig.3). Our data revealed that phosphorylated Akt levels were elevated after daily bouts of cyclic stretch (Fig.4b). The phosphorylated Akt to total Akt activity ratio trended upwards with 2 days of a daily cyclic stretch but was not different from than controls (Fig.3c). Akt phosphorylation levels were significantly lower in 3dAT than in 2dHY but were no different than controls (Fig.3b). pAkt/total Akt for 3dAT was similar to the no stretch control group.\n\naTotal Akt activity.bPhosphorylation level of Akt (Thr308).cRatio between phosphorylation Akt (Thr32) and total Akt levels.dTotal FOXO3a activity.ePhosphorylation level of FoxO3a.fRatio between phosphorylation FoxO3a and total FoxO3a levels.

The boxplots illustrate the interquartile range (25th 75th percentiles) displayed with whiskers spanning from the 10th to the 90th percentiles. The median of the data is indicated by the central line.\n\nThe FoxO3a transcription factor can be phosphorylated and inactivated by Akt phosphorylation or conversely dephosphorylated and stimulated by pro inflammatory signaling. Total protein levels for FoxO3a were elevated by almost 3 fold after cessation of daily cyclic stretch compared with the no stretch, 2dHY and 5dHY groups (Fig.3d). However, the p FoxO3a/total FoxO3a levels were significantly lower in the 3dAT group than in controls and trended lower than in the myotubes subjected to daily bouts of cyclic strain (Fig.3f). The data suggest that FoxO3a levels are elevated, and the proportion of dephosphorylated FoxO3a and thus activated FoxO3a is upregulated with when daily bouts of cyclic stretch are removed.\n\nIn order to understand whether the cessation of cyclic strain and subsequent atrophy was linked with catabolic, inflammatory signaling, we interrogated three canonical inflammatory proteins that contribute to skeletal muscle fiber atrophy during unloading. For this purpose, we measured myotube levels of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin 1 (IL 1) and interleukin 6 (IL 6), as well as the p65 subunit of the pro inflammatory, pro oxidant transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF B). Protein abundance detected through immunoblotting revealed no statistical difference in IL 1, IL 6, and p65 among myotubes subjected to no stretch, 2 days of cyclic stretch, and 5 days of cyclic stretch (Fig.4). However, there was a 2 3 fold increase in IL 1, IL 6, and p65 compared with 2dHY, 5dHY, and the no stretch controls, similar to the pattern observed in total FoxO3a levels. These data suggest a significant role of key pro inflammatory cytokines and NF kappaB in myotube atrophy following the removal of daily bouts of cyclic stretch.",
    "discussion": "In the current study, we examined the efficacy of the application and withdrawal of uniaxial cyclic stretch on myotubes as a prospective bioreactor for use in spaceflight research. The uniaxial cyclic stretch produced tensile loading on myotubes with some shear in anchoring interface with laminin on the dish or membrane. Withdrawal from cyclic stretch elicits an 'off transient' period that our data suggest mimics unloading microgravity. The cyclic stretch protocol (12% sinusoidal stretch, 0.7Hz waveform frequency, 1hour/day) over 2 and 5 days produced marked hypertrophy of skeletal muscle myotubes, accompanied by elevated anabolic markers (talin, Akt phosphorylation at Thr308). In contrast, withdrawal and cessation of cyclic stretch resulted in substantial atrophy on myotube diameter, concomitant with reduced Akt phosphorylation, and elevation of catabolic, pro inflammatory markers (e.g., IL 1, IL 6, NF kappaB subunit p65) as well as proteolytic signaling (e.g., reduced FoxO3a phosphorylation/total FoxO3a ratio, elevated total FoxO3a). A discussion of the physiological and technological development relevance follows.\n\nThese findings have a number of parallels with the data published by Soltow, et al. (2013)35using the FlexCell as a model for overloading and unloading (e.g., microgravity). The FlexCell's 2 days cyclic stretching protocol (12%, 0.7Hz,1h/d) using collagen coated plates increased myotube diameter, talin levels, Akt phosphorylation activity, and FoxO3a phosphorylation leading to stretch induced muscle hypertrophy and growth. In contrast, 48h after the removal of bouts of cyclic stretch resulted in decreased anabolic signaling, increased FoxO3a dephosphorylation, thus activating pro inflammatory and muscle atrophic signaling and causing smaller myotube diameter. These data suggest that uniaxial stretch and cessation of stretch can be validly used to test myotube responses to both increased and decreased mechanical loading.\n\nIn contrast, rotating wall vessels bioreactors are commonly used in tissue engineering and cell culture research to simulate microgravity conditions. These bioreactors create a three dimensional culture environment with low shear forces, mimicking some aspects of weightlessness. However, they are not effective in inducing the primary consequence of weightlessness on skeletal muscles, which is a dramatically reduced tensile load. Furthermore, centrifugation adds compressive stress to alleviate microgravity, a far different loading profile that skeletal muscles and attached tendons experience (e.g., tension along the long axis) in a terrestrial environment.\n\nIncreased tensile stress and strain in skeletal muscle fibers promote muscle growth by elevating protein synthesis and altering protein degradation, thus initiating muscle hypertrophy40 42. Recent reports also characterized an increase in myotube diameter ex vivo in response to mechanical stretch and stimulation35,43,44. In our StrexCell application, the uniaxial cyclic stretching protocol for 2 days and 5 days produced tensile loading on myotubes, which resulted in muscle fiber hypertrophy. Thus, loading of tensile force stimulated an increased myotube diameter and size, confirming that cyclic stretch in myotubes elicits hypertrophy of the muscle fibers (Fig.1). Overloading produced by cyclic stretch induced muscle hypertrophy that was directly linked to increased markers of anabolism and hypertrophy, including upregulation of talin and increased Akt phosphorylation at Thr308. Akt activation is a causal regulator in protein synthesis signaling in skeletal muscle45,46. For example, the overexpression of active Akt levels previously elicited skeletal muscle myotube hypertrophy47. Furthermore, we found that bouts cyclic stretch activated Akt through phosphorylation at Thr308, which was linked to an elevated phosphorylated FoxO3a/total FoxO3a ratio which could suppress catabolism. Consistently, we previously demonstrated that the antioxidant enzyme mimetic EUK 134 relieved unloading induced decrease in Akt phosphorylation (deactivation) and decrease in FoxO3a phosphorylation (activation)5.\n\nWithdrawal and cessation of the cyclic stretching protocol affect skeletal muscle myotubes producing mechanical unloading alterations. Using the StrexCell system to release from daily cyclic stretch, C2C12 myotubes underwent a significant reduction in myotube size after 3 days cessation of cyclic stretch (Fig.1). A rapid reduction in skeletal muscle size mimics the muscle disuse atrophy that occurs with mechanical unloading4,6,35. Indeed, mechanical unloading and spaceflight lead to both a suppression of anabolic signaling and an elevation of proteolytic pathways, thus leading to muscle fiber atrophy1,12. FoxO3a is an atrophy associated transcription factor that is translocated to the nucleus in its active form during skeletal muscle unloading. Indeed, nuclear accumulation of active FoxO3a is the atrophy associated transcription factor FoxO3a is linked to muscle atrophy48,49. In our StrexCell protocol, withdrawal of daily cyclic stretching led to increased levels of unphosphorylated (i.e., active) FoxO3a, consistent with protein degradation's role in muscle atrophy (Fig.3). The total amount of FoxO3a was nearly tripled, also suggesting potential stimulation of catabolic signaling. There was a smaller 40% increase in phosphorylated Foxo3a. thus was a statistically significant decrease (more than 50%) in the p FoxO3a/total FoxO3a ratio, consistent with greater potential for rapid protein degradation and myotube fiber atrophy. Notably, spaceflight microgravity lowered the Akt activity pathway by downregulating the eIF4/p70S6K signaling50. Furthermore, Bodine and Baehr (2014)51reported that the FoxO3a transcription factor regulates the MuRF1 and MAFbx expression involved in the protein degradation process leading to muscle atrophy52.\n\nAkt activation is a well known causal regulator of protein synthesis signaling in skeletal muscle45,46. Downregulation of the Akt activation pathway, which is associated with dephosphorylation of Akt and 4E BP1, has been consistently reported in muscle atrophy53 55. Our laboratory previously reported downregulation of Akt and mTOR phosphorylation in response the mechanical unloading, prevented by EUK 134 an antioxidant mimetic of superoxide dismutase and catalase8. In this study, Akt phosphorylation was significantly decreased when daily cyclic stretch was withdrawn for three days. This observation would be consistent with reduced protein synthesis and thus muscle atrophy.\n\nSimultaneous activation of FoxO3a and suppression of an Akt mTOR pathways with skeletal muscle wasting, including mechanical unloading has been a frequent observation12,40,46,56 58. Indeed, historical and recent studies have consistently documented increased proteolysis59coupled with decreased skeletal muscle protein synthesis in response to hindlimb unloading of hindlimb muscles13,60. Furthermore, we previously documented greater dephosphorylation of FoxO3a, accompanied by downregulation of an Akt mTOR pathway with unloading induced skeletal muscle atrophy8. This is consistent with the argument that dephosphorylation of Akt can activate FoxO3a and thus enhance proteolysis during unloading induced atrophy8,61. Integration of Akt1 and FoxO3a signaling illustrated the role of Akt in simultaneously regulating muscle protein synthesis and protein degradation62.\n\nVarious pro inflammatory signaling pathways activated by cytokines, inflammatory transcription factors, and inflammatory substrates have been implicated in muscle atrophy by affecting muscle protein turnover or myonuclear turnover63,64. Unloading induced muscle atrophy has been consistently linked to an elevation of inflammatory cytokines including interleukin 1 beta (IL 1), interleukin 6 (IL 6), interferon gamma (IFN gamma), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF alpha)65. Furthermore, the transcription factor NF kappaB (NF B) is often elevated during mechanical unloading and may contribute to the atrophy process12. We found that the inflammatory cytokines IL 1 and IL 6 and the p65 subunit of NF kappaB were markedly higher in the muscle myotubes after daily cyclic stretching had been discontinued for three days (Fig.4). The large magnitude of upregulation for IL 2, IL 6, and p65 while myotubes were in a humoral free medium clearly indicated that circulating cytokines and endocrine factors could not exclusively account for the marked elevation of inflammatory signaling. Indeed, these data support the hypothesis that much of inflammatory medication in unloaded muscle fibers could be localized within the muscle fibers. Therefore, upregulation of inflammatory mediators during the loading period must be a result of mechanosensing within the myotubes, rather than circulatory factors.\n\nPhysiologically, a 2 3 fold elevation of IL 1 and IL 6 would be expected to stimulate pro inflammatory signaling, oxidative stress, protein degradation, and muscle atrophy66. Spaceflight and hindlimb unloading induced atrophy are not surprisingly characterized by increased levels of IL 1 and IL 667,68. Given that IL 1 and IL 6 can activate or be activated by NF B57, thus it was expected that NF kappaB subunit p65 would also upregulated following cessation of daily cyclic stretch (Fig.4C). NF B has previously found to be involved in mechanical unloading induced muscle atrophy69 71. Upregulation of NF B, IL 1, and IL 6 can lead to a decrease in phosphorylation of Akt and FoxO3 phosphorylation, consistent with a shift toward catabolic signaling72. Therefore, it is likely that the large elevation of IL 1, IL 5, and p65 contributed to suppression of anabolism, elevation of catabolic signaling, and thus atrophy of the myotubes.\n\nThis study has some limitations, while the unloaded/microgravity model was not free floating we argue that there is a tradeoff is being able to induce cyclic tensile strain and release of cyclic stretch bouts as a reasonable simulation of the unloading of microgravity. Skeletal muscles are complex tissues that generate tensile forces to produce body movement and stability. Muscles adapt to changes in tensile loading by adjusting their mass and cross sectional area. When mechanical tensile loading is diminished or absent in vivo (e.g., spaceflight, casting, bedrest) during periods of immobility or inactivity, muscle fiber cross sectional area is decreased in response. Even with the limitations outlined above, myotubes in this study responded significantly to bouts of cycle stretch by myotube hypertrophy and underwent atrophy when unloaded. Thus, our StrexCell model of increased and release of tensile loading resulted in biological responses that would be predictable given the physiological responses to overloading and unloading in vivo.\n\nWhile tensile loading produces stretch on the myotubes, there is a limitation of a lack of contractile activity during stretch. Indeed, StrexCell modules may not fully mimic resistive training bouts, and there could be significant differences in mechanosensing, Ca2+homeostasis, etc. the response of calpains to both loading and unloading recapitulate in vivo responses to exercise and disuse (Hyatt & Powers 2020). In addition, anabolic, catabolic, and inflammatory responses would be predictable and consistent with in vivo loading and unloading data.\n\nWhile calpain activity is accepted as an important indicator of cellular Ca2+ overload, we were unable to measure cellular Ca2+directly, using a fluorescence probe (e.g., fluo 4), We will measure [Ca2+] levels in future as well as additional, important markers of Ca2+overload such as SERCA1, SERCA2a, sarcolipin, etc.\n\nIn conclusion the development of a uniaxial bioreactor for skeletal muscle will assist future studies, on the ground and during spaceflight, to elucidate mechanisms that cause skeletal muscle atrophy and remodeling during spaceflight. In addition, the StrexCell bioreactor would allow direct testing of countermeasure strategies against the adverse effects of spaceflight, including microgravity and radiation. In this study, we tested and developed an alternative bioreactor to mimic the effects of both overloading and microgravity induced skeletal muscle atrophy by imposing and withdrawing periods of cyclic tensile strain, using a StrexCell uniaxial stretch system. The withdrawal of cyclic stretch was used to demonstrate that mechanical inactivity turns off signaling for muscle hypertrophy, while elevating pro inflammatory, pro catabolic pathways that drive protein degradation, thus causing myotube atrophy. Therefore, we conclude that the StrexCell uniaxial stretch system is a viable alternative bioreactor to study spaceflight and re  (over)loading in skeletal muscle cells.",
