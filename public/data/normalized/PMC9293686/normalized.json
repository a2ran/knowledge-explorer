    "abstract": "The forces generated by gravity have shaped life on Earth and impact gene expression and morphogenesis during early development. Conversely, disuse on Earth or during spaceflight, reduces normal mechanical loading of organisms, resulting in altered cell and tissue function. Although gravity mechanical loading in adult mammals is known to promote increased cell proliferation and differentiation, little is known about how distinct cell types respond to gravity mechanostimulation during early development. In this study we sought to understand, with single cell RNA sequencing resolution, how a 60 min pulse of 50ghypergravity (HG)/5kPa hydrostatic pressure, influences transcriptomic regulation of developmental processes in the embryoid body (EB) model. Our study included both day 9 EBs and progenitor mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) with or without the HG pulse. Single cell t distributed stochastic neighbor mapping shows limited transcriptome shifts in response to the HG pulse in either ESCs or EBs; this pulse however, induces greater positional shifts in EB mapping compared to ESCs, indicating the influence of mechanotransduction is more pronounced in later states of cell commitment within the developmental program. More specifically, HG resulted in upregulation of self renewal and angiogenesis genes in ESCs, while in EBs, HG loading was associated with upregulation of Gene Ontology pathways for multicellular development, mechanical signal transduction, and DNA damage repair. Cluster transcriptome analysis of the EBs show HG promotes maintenance of transitory cell phenotypes in early development; including EB cluster co expression of markers for progenitor, post implant epiblast, and primitive endoderm phenotypes with HG pulse but expression exclusivity in the non pulsed clusters. Pseudotime analysis identified three branching cell types susceptible to HG induction of cell fate decisions. In totality, this study provides novel evidence that ESC maintenance and EB development can be regulated by gravity mechanostimulation and that stem cells committed to a differentiation program are more sensitive to gravity induced changes to their transcriptome.\n\nKeywords:mechanotransduction, embryoid bodies, embryonic stem cells, single cell RNA sequencing, development",
    "methods": "Clonal C57BL/6J ESCs (ATCC SCRC 1002) were seeded at 3E6 cells in a 10cm2tissue culture dish coated with 0.1% gelatin (Fig. 1A). The mESCs were expanded for two passages in mESC medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, 4mML glutamine, 1xnonessential amino acids, 1mM sodium pyruvate, 1% antibiotic solution [penicillin/streptomycin], trace beta mercaptoethanol, and 10ng/mL leukemia inhibitory factor [LIF]). The medium was changed daily and cells were passaged every 48h using 0.25% trypsin solution and re seeded at 3E6 cells per dish before reaching experimental maturity (Fig. 1A, C). After the second expansion, a subset of the mESCs (6E6 cells per dish) were transferred to an ultra low adhesion 10cm2tissue culture dishes and LIF removed from the culture media to allow cells to aggregate and form EBs (Fig. 1B). Half of the media was changed daily and cell aggregation was inspected using a Leica DMi1 inverted light microscope.\n\nSixty minutes 50g/5kPa hydrostatic pressure loading pulse induces limited transcriptomic shift in ESC or EB model. Brightfield images of cultured mouse ESCs(A)and non adherent day 5 EBs(B)show morphologic differences from the actin cytoskeleton (green) and DAPI nuclear (blue) florescent images of post HG pulse ESCs(C)and day 9 adherent EBs(D). Experimental design for EB development and 60 min HG loading(E)and no pulse control(F).(G)tSNE mapping show the HG pulse cause limited positional shifts for either the ESC or EB cells. However, the HG EBs do show islets (positional shifts indicated by dashed encirclement) indicating mechanotransduction is more pronounced in later developmental states of cell commitment. 36.1% of all upregulated genes(H)and 27.4% of downregulated genes(I)are shared between ESCs and EBs. DAPI; EB, embryoid body; ESCs, embryonic stem cells; HG, hypergravity; tSNE, t distributed stochastic neighbor.\n\nThe EBs were cultured for 5 days before further processing. On the fifth day, EBs were seeded onto 0.1% (w/v) collagen coated platinum treated silicon membranes and allowed to adhere and outgrow for 4 days (Fig. 1D). After the 4 days, the EB cultures and control mESC cultures were exposed to a 1 h HG pulse of 50gin a cell culture 1 ft diameter centrifuge. The acceleration level of 50gused in this study with a 1cm medium column above adherent cells results in a calculated hydrostatic pressure of about 5kPa corresponding to a mid range physiological value for mammalian non load bearing tissues (P=gh, whereis the density of the medium in kilogram per cubic meter,gis gravity acceleration in meter per second squared, andhis the depth of the liquid in meter). Centrifugation was performed using a custom modified (vented lid) Eppendorf 5804 1 ft diameter rotor centrifuge with multi well plate adapters inside an environmental chamber with 5% carbon dioxide, 37 degreesC, and 90% humidity. After mechanostimulation, the cultures were continued for a further 6h, allowing for transcriptomic response under static 1gconditions.\n\nThe EB and ESC cultures were dissociated into single cell suspension and prepared for 10xGenomics RNA sequencing according to the Gene Expression Profiling v2 chemistry protocol (10xGenomics). The four conditions evaluated were mESC control and HG mechanical pulse stimulated and EB control and HG mechanical pulse stimulated (respectively ESC_C, ESC_HG, EB_C, EB_HG). After Illumina sequencing, the samples were demultiplexed and analyzed using 10xGenomics CellRanger software v4.0 to produce barcode, gene expression, and library identification matrices. These datasets were then assessed for clustering by Seurat and for developmental trajectory by Monocle 2 and 3 to produce our data visualizations in t distributed stochastic neighbor (tSNE), uniform manifold approximation, and projection (UMAP) statistical and Pseudotime relationship mapping methods.

    "results": "Single cell tSNE mapping of ESCs and EBs show that a 60 min HG pulse results in minimal deviation in cellular transcriptomic signature (Fig. 1G). Cell mapping shows that most ESC cells share general overlap between the HG pulse (red) and unstimulated controls (blue); However, HG pulse EB cells have areas in the tSNE space largely populated by HG pulse cells with minimal EB non pulse control cells (Fig. 1G area largely populated by HG pulse cells indicated by dashed encirclement). Assessing mechano induced (Fig. 1J) or  suppressed (Fig. 1K) differentially expressed (DE) genes shared between ESCs and EBs show only 1/3 DE genes have common mechanoregulation. In response to HG pulse EBs show more upregulated genes than ESCs while ESCs and EBs have similar numbers of downregulated genes but fewer are shared.\n\nWhen single cell expression information was assessed by Gene Ontology (GO) Consensus Pathway Analysis (CPA) [31] the DE genes were found to be related to developmental pathways, mechanotransduction, and genomic stress/repair mechanisms.Figure 2presents the GO CPA mapping and expression heatmaps for the highest DE genes from each pathway. The pathways presented are highly connected, indicating organized response to mechanical loading (Fig. 2A). HG pulse EBs DE genes show organized upregulation compared to no pulse EBs expression while the HG pulse ESC cells show upregulation of many genes within the pathways but many also have no expression change, indicating cellular response to loading but not organized change in the population transcriptome (Fig. 2B D). Genes associated with angiogenesis are the exception as ESCs cultured under HG pulse show organized upregulation of genes while the EBs do not.\n\nPathway analysis shows HG pulse induces organized upregulation of multicellular organism developmental, mechanotransduction, and DNA stress/repair pathways.(A)CPA results show three main GO pathways differentially regulated by hypergravity pulse stimulation in developmental model:green bluecoloring labels developmental pathways;navy yellowcoloring labels mechanotransduction and signal transduction pathways; andmagenta orangecoloring label DNA damage and repair mechanism pathways (see legend).(B D)Expression mapping for key genes in representative nodes of each of the three key regulatory processes upregulated by mechanical stimulation in the developmental model.(B)Genes key to developmental pathways,(C)genes key to mechanotransduction and signal transduction, and(D)are genes key to DNA damage and repair mechanisms. Results demonstrate that HG stimulation induces upregulation of many pathway genes in both EB and ESC models. However, the EBs respond with the greatest number of upregulated genes per pathway and greatest upregulation of individual genes in response to hypergravity pulse. CPA, consensus pathway analysis; GO, gene ontology.\n\nEB UMAP clustering shows little deviation in mathematical clustering due to HG pulse stimulation (Fig. 3A). Nine clusters are identified in both libraries with minimal mapping divergences. ESCs, pre  and post implantation lineage, primitive endoderm, germ cells, and extra embryonic cell general positions are identified within the UMAP space. Within the UMAP reference frame, the application of HG pulse changes the location of the extra embryonic cells and cluster 9 is suppressed (indicated by grey boxes). Extra embryonic cells are responsible for regulating implantation and development of the amnion and placental tissue, which are the first adherent cells affected by direct mechanical stimulation and the gene markers for the trophoblasts (cluster 1 markers includeEfna1,Dab2,Pparg, andKrt18) and extraembryonic ectoderm (cluster 9 markers includeTfap2a,Hand1,Cdx2,Krt7, andWnt6) have increased expression with HG pulse.\n\nHG pulse elicits greater expression of developmental markers but reduces cluster expression exclusivity in favor of more transitory cell phenotype.(A)UMAP clustering identifies nine clusters for both HG pulse and no pulse control EBs. Two clusters identify as extra embryonic tissues (gray boxes) and seven clusters identify along the three germ layer developmental program. General cell type locals are indicated for progenitor ESCs, pre  and post implant epiblasts (pre I and post I epiblast respectively), PrE, and germ cell transcriptomic signatures. HG pulse reduces the separation of pre implant epiblasts and primitive endoderm cells (indicated byhashed arrow).(B)Cluster specific expression of developmental cell type markers show HG pulse increases occurrence of multiple cell type marker expression within a cluster, indicating more transitory phenotypes with HG pulse loading. PrE, primitive endoderm; UMAP, uniform manifold approximation and projection.\n\nFigure 3Bvisualizes representative marker genes of potency, ESC, primitive endoderm, pre  and post implantation epiblast lineages. Cluster specific assessment show high expression of the potency markerOct4/Pou5f1in all EB clusters irrespective of loading condition; However, clusters 5 9 show deviation in the level and normality of theOct4expression with HG pulse. Clusters 5 7 deviate toward greater expression with HG pulse, suggesting maintenance of potency features within these clusters. Clusters 8 and 9 have reduced expression, suggestive of stem/progenitor cell commitment to specialization.\n\nESC markerEsrrbis expressed in clusters 3 and 4 independent of HG pulse while clusters 5 and 7 expressEsrrbexclusively under conditions of HG pulse. These data suggest maintenance of \"stemness\" transcriptomic qualities in cells of clusters 5 and 7 in response to HG pulse. Mapping and expression of Pre Implant epiblast markerTfap2cshow expression in no pulse control EB cells of clusters 4, 5, and 8. Co expression of ESC markerEsrrband Pre Epiblast markerTfap2cin cluster 4 indicate a transitory phenotype between ESC and Pre Implant epiblast. The application of HG pulse induces co expression ofEsrrbandTfap2cin clusters 5 and 7. This transcriptomic shift shows that HG pulse increases cells with ESC/Pre Implant Epiblast transitory phenotype. In the non pulse control EB cells clusters 5 and 8 expressTfap2cwithout corresponding ESC marker expression, defining these cells as non transitory Epiblasts.\n\nPost implant epiblast markerDnmt3bshows co expression with pre implant epiblast clusters 5 and 8. HG pulse results in additional co expression ofDnmt3bandTfap2cin cluster 7 indicating increased pre  to post implant epiblast transitory cells.Dnmt3bis expressed in clusters 2, 3, 5 8 of both libraries, implying the majority of cells at day 9 EB culture are post implant epiblast transcriptionally identified cells, which is consistent with published literature [13,26].Dmnt3bis expressed in cluster 9 of the no pulse control EB cells but not the HG pulse cluster 9 cells, linking post implant epiblasts to the extra embryonic tissue and suggesting a branch point in the developmental program that is hidden in the single cell trajectory, by mechanism of silencing or acceleration through the developmental program by the HG pulse.\n\nPrimitive endoderm markerNplis present in cluster 6 of the no pulse control cells and cluster 8 of the HG pulse EBs. The HG pulse cluster 8 identified primitive endoderm cells that show co expression of pre  and post implant epiblast markers. Location within the UMAP coordinate system demonstrates that HG pulse reduces the transcriptomic separation of pre implant and primitive endoderm cells (distance indicated by dashed arrows inFig. 3). These data show that early commitment lineages are regulated by the mechanical environment, and that specifically HG pulse stimulation causes transition of cells through the early developmental program.\n\nTo more closely examine how HG pulse influences cell transitory transcriptomic signature, Monocle 3 mapping assigned pseudotime scale to the non pulse control EB UMAP and the HG pulse EB UMAP (Fig. 4A). The pseudotime mapping shows that the developmental tracing for the EB libraries is similar with HG pulse advancing pseudotime distance between the ESCs (cluster 3 cells identified as the start of the trajectory) and the terminal cells (ectoderm lineage). Monocle trajectory mapping was done to more directly identify developmental relationship of cells within the UMAP space (Fig. 4B). The developmental trajectory identifies several branch points unique to the HG pulse EB cells (Fig. 4C, grey boxes).\n\nDevelopmental trajectory of EBs stimulated with HG show more commitment to lineage differentiation and unique branching points responsible for cell fate decisions.(A)UMAP dimension colored for pseudotime scale show HG pulse advances cell commitment to developmental differentiation.(B)EB HG pulse and non pulse cells mapped in the pseudotime coordinate system show the developmental trajectory of the non extra embryonic cells (gray boxesindicate cell carried into developmental trajectory analysis).(C)Phenotype identified cellular staging for progenitor ESCs (ESC), pre  and post implant epiblasts (Pre I and post I respectively), PrE, and the Endo, Meso, and Ecto germ layers. Unique branching points for populations of senESC, cephalocaudal folding cells (Ceph Caud), and PS cells. These phenotypes could not be segregated in the non pulse control EBs; however, these are likely still present as the developmental trajectory of the EBs are not altered between control and HG pulse EBs. HG pulse moves the PrE cluster closer to ESCs along the developmental trajectory compared to control, indicating maintained progenitor potency in cells committed to later differentiation states. Ecto, ectoderm; Endo, endoderm; Meso, mesoderm; PS, primitive streak; senESC, senescent ESCs.\n\nProgrammatically the first branch of cells to diverge from the main trajectory pathway, labeled as branch point 5 in the HG pulse trajectory map, was identified as senescent ESC (senESC) cell type due to high expression of ESC markersOct4/Pou5f1,Esrrb,Zfp42, andTcf15in addition to higher expression of senescence markerCdkn2a/P16. Branch point 1 cells present transcriptional signatures related to cephalocaudal folding (Ceph Caud), showing co expression of genesAtp4a,Foxj1,Nkx2,Ctnnb1, andWnts, descriptive of foregut formation. At branch point 3, cells are transcriptomically identified as Primitive Streak (PS), which are transitory cells with transcriptomic signature similar to post implantation epiblasts (Dnmt3b,Kif1a,Fgf5), markers consistent with developmental signaling (Wnts,Ctnnb1,Fgf8,T,Psmb8) and the of the three germ layer lineages (Spink1,Apob,Postn,Sox11,Pdgfc). These transcriptomically identified cells are positioned along the trajectory before the post implant epiblast and endoderm branch point, again supporting that HG pulse encourages maintenance of diversity of transcriptional states by retention of cell markers associated with transitory stages.",
    "discussion": "Investigations of mechanical unloading during spaceflight in microgravity have demonstrated the maintenance of \"stemness\" in ESCs, developmental EB spheroids, and lineage specific stem cells [22,23,32,33]. In contrast positive dynamic loading studies have shown that mechanical stimulation induces upregulation of proliferative and specialization gene pathways via independent molecular mechanisms [5]. Our study demonstrated that a 60 min HG pulse in day 9 EBs results in limited divergence in cell type assignment and transcriptomic signature from traditional static culture EBs. Embryo development studies varying gravity environment in murine models have shown that stage of gestation when the gravity disturbance is applied is critical. NASA NIH.R1, NASA NIH.R2 studies assessed rat breeding pairs on orbit finding that on orbit breeding resulted in no viable pups; However, there were signs of early stage pregnancies in a small portion of the females [34].\n\nConversely, studies of 2gHG during gestation did not interfere with mating or gestation [35] but 3gresulted in no viable pupping. Another study conducted by Schenker and Forkheim, on early pregnancy mice found that spaceflight exposure resulted in failed gestation of pre implantation embryos, however mid  or late stage embryos completed gestation without significant developmental deviation [36,37]. Assessment of the developing embryos for molecular mechanism of failed early stage gestation identified decreased DNA repair mechanisms and increased identification of DNA damage response (DDR). These data correspond with findings of Lei et al., which found that blastocyte formation and quality were compromised by spaceflight by mechanisms similar to ground based low dose radiation [38]. Our investigation established that a pulse of HG loading increased DNA repair and apoptotic processes. These studies collectively suggesting a potential gravity regulated DDR pathway that may play a role in regulating how developmental cells respond to DNA damage, critical for the cell transition from pre  to post implantation and gestation success.\n\nOur single cell study evaluated the transcriptomic change associated with a single physiologically relevant pulse of mechanical loading and demonstrated the load unload dynamics result in increased developmental progression. Similarly, a recent parabolic flight study evaluated repeated micro  to hyper gravity periodic loading [39] finding ESCs exposed to the 31 parabolas elicited downregulation of proliferation and cell cycle genes and upregulation of developmental/differentiation genes. Additionally, ESCs recovered from the parabolic gravity loading then cultured as EBs for a further 12 days showed elevated Gene Ontology/ Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways associated with skeletal, respiratory, blood vessels, liver, and nervous system and suppression of cardiac development pathways.\n\nBlaber et al., collected 15 day EBs on orbit for gene expression profiling, finding inhibition of terminal germ layer lineage markers and decrease in mechanotransduction signaling and membrane spanning proteins [22]. These data providing further evidence that absence of normal mechanical loading may restrict developmental potential. Together these complementary studies provide strong evidence that gravity loading regulates mammalian developmental processes and stem cell specialization. It is possible, however, that synergistic effects between mechanical unloading during spaceflight and space radiation, as reported by Blaber et al., may also contribute to the observed effects. Future investigations should address this potential synergy by combining mechanical loading with particle accelerator simulated relevant space radiation doses and dose rates.\n\nFinally, the single cell approach we used also allowed for mapping of the developmental program in a pseudotime coordinates system that models and orders temporal relationships between various gene expression states of cells in a population. Mapping EB development of the HG and unstimulated controls show cell populations are susceptible to \"branching\" cell fate decisions in response to gravity loading. Embryogenesis cell fate decisions are highly choreographed in response to cell cell, cell matrix, and cytokine signaling [40 42]. Because these cell fate decisions play a decisive role in execution of the developmental program, single cell may allow for more precise transcriptomic mapping of cell fate decisions based on transcriptomic similarity between cells [43,44].\n\nUtilizing such methods to assess embryogenesis, investigations have found specificity of cell lineage tracing such as primordial germ cell tracing to pre implant epiblasts [27] and definition of mid  to late PS transitory transcriptomic signature [28]. Our single cell assessment of HG trajectory demonstrates that a positive gravity load induces branching of an inactive pluripotent population of ESC signature positive cells (Oct4+, Tcf15+, Gbx2+, etc.) with little to no cell cycle transcriptomic activity (cyclin/CDK complexes [45]), distinct from the starting ESC cell population. Our study also visualized branching points for cephalocaudal folding gene expression and PS signature cells between pre  and post implant epiblast transition.",
    "conclusion": "This study offers a novel assessment of how in vitro ESC maintenance and EB development can be regulated by a positive pulse of gravity loading at single cell resolution. Specifically, we show that a 60 min 50g/5kPa HG pulse resulted in cells during early development maintaining transitory phenotypes, and having enhanced expression of germ layer lineage markers. This study further defines the power of gravity loading in regulating stem cell self renewal and differentiation by identification of transcriptomic patterns in stem cells and developmental processes, which can aid in understanding how gravity can be leveraged to elicit regenerative responses; benefiting in vitro platforms for organoid tissue culture, and regenerative medicine."
