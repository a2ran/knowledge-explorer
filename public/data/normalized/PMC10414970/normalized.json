    "abstract": "Plant roots navigate in the soil environment following the gravity vector. Cell divisions in the meristem and rapid cell growth in the elongation zone propel the root tips through the soil. Actively elongating cells acidify their apoplast to enable cell wall extension by the activity of plasma membrane AHA H+ ATPases. The phytohormone auxin, central regulator of gravitropic response and root development, inhibits root cell growth, likely by rising the pH of the apoplast. However, the role of auxin in the regulation of the apoplastic pH gradient along the root tip is unclear. Here, we show, by using an improved method for visualization and quantification of root surface pH, that theArabidopsis thalianaroot surface pH shows distinct acidic and alkaline zones, which are not primarily determined by the activity of AHA H+ ATPases. Instead, the distinct domain of alkaline pH in the root transition zone is controlled by a rapid auxin response module, consisting of the AUX1 auxin influx carrier, the AFB1 auxin co receptor, and the CNCG14 calcium channel. We demonstrate that the rapid auxin response pathway is required for an efficient navigation of the root tip.\n\nResearch organism:A. thaliana",
    "methods": "We used the Col 0 ecotype and the following mutant and transgenic lines. The PIN2>>AHA2delta95, PIN2>>PP2C D1 originate from this study, see Molecular cloning. Further, we used theaha2 4(SALK_082786),pp2c d2/5/6triple mutant (Ren et al., 2018) (pp2c d2 WsDsLOX493G12, pp2c d5GABI_330E08, and pp2c d6 SAIL_171H03),aux1 100(SALK_020355),pin2(NASC_N16706). Theafb1 3and AFB1::AFB1 mCitrine inafb1 3originate fromPrigge et al., 2020. Theafb1 1s(SALK_144884C) was genotyped using the following primers SALK_LBb1.3,AACGGAAGACTAGGAAGCGAG,GCAACAGCTTCAAGACCTTTG. Thecngc14 1(SALK_206460) was genotyped by SALK_LBb1.3,CACCTGCTTGTAAAGCAAAGG,TCGGAACAATTGGCAGAATAC;cngc14 2(wiscDsLox437E09) by WisDsLox_LBP (AACGTCCGCAATGTGTTATTAAGTTGTC),TGTTTCACGTAAAGTCAAACCC,TAAGAATCCAAGTGGCCACAC. The CNGC14::CNGC14 GFP (see Molecular cloning) was transformed into thecngc14 1andcngc14 2homozygous lines. Thetir tripleis thetir1,afb2,3mutant (Dharmasiri et al., 2005). We used thetmk1 1 (SALK_016360),tmk4 1 (GABI_348E01) (Li et al., 2021), and theabp1 TD1(SK21825) (Gao et al., 2015). AUX1::AUX1 YFP (Swarup et al., 2004) was introduced intoafb1 3andcngc14 2by crossing. AUX1::AUX1 YFP was crossed with PIN::PIN2 mCherry (Retzer et al., 2019).\n\nSeeds were surface sterilized by chlorine gas for 2 hr. Seeds were sown on 1% (wt/vol) plant agar (Duchefa) with  Murashige Skoog salts (MS, Duchefa), 1% (wt/vol) sucrose, adjusted to pH 5.8 with KOH, and stratified for 2 days at 4 degreesC. Seedlings were vertically grown for 5 days in a growth chamber at 23 degreesC by day (16 hr), 18 degreesC by night (8 hr), 60% humidity, and light intensity of 120 umol photons/m2/s.\n\nThe tissue specific estradiol inducible lines were prepared as follows. For PIN2>>AHA2delta95, we cloned the CDS 1 886 of AHA2 (AT4G30190) lacking the last 95 amino acids as inPacheco Villalobos et al., 2016, and fused mScarlet I (Bindels et al., 2017) to the C terminal part. For PIN2>>PP2C D1, we cloned the CDS of PP2C D1 (AT5G02760) and fused mScarlet I to the C terminal part. Both constructs were cloned downstream of the 4xLexA Operon fused to CaMV 35S minimal promoter (Sarrion Perdigones et al., 2013) and the transcriptional units were terminated by the 35S terminator and cloned into the alpha1 3 vectors (Dusek et al., 2020). XVE (Zuo et al., 2000) was cloned under the control of the PIN2 promoter (1.4 kb upstream of the AT5G57090), terminated by the RuBisCo terminator fromPisum sativumand the resulting transcriptional unit was cloned into alpha1 1 vector. The alpha transcriptional units were then interspaced with matrix attachment regions (Dusek et al., 2020), combined with a Basta resistance cassette and introduced into the pDGB3omega1 binary vector (Sarrion Perdigones et al., 2013). The CNGC14::CNGC14 GFP construct contains the CNCG14 promoter (1.5 kb upstream of the start codon) and the CNGC14 coding sequence (the AT2G24610.1 splice variant) with the GFP fused to the C terminus and 35S terminator. This transcriptional unit was combined with a kanamycin resistance cassette and FastRed marker for rapid selection of transgenic seeds into the pDGB3omega1 binary vector. All cloning steps were performed using the GoldenBraid methodology (Sarrion Perdigones et al., 2013;https://gbcloning.upv.es/).\n\nCol 0 ecotype (PIN2>>AHA2delta95, PIN2>>PP2C D1) orcngc14 1andcngc14 2lines (CNGC14 mVenus) were transformed using the floral dip method (Clough and Bent, 1998).\n\nTreatments were prepared using the following chemicals: IAA (10 mM stock in ethanol; Sigma Aldrich), FC (1 mM stock in ethanol; Sigma Aldrich), estradiol (20 mM stock in DMSO; Sigma Aldrich). Fluorescein Dextran 10,000 MW, Anionic (D1821, Thermo Fisher)   10 mg/ml stock in miliQ H2O, final concentration in media is 29 ug/ml. Oregon Green 488 Dextran, 10,000 MW (D7170, Invitrogen)   1 mg/ml stock in miliQ H2O, final concentration in media is 2.5 ug/ml. HPTS (H1529, Sigma Aldrich), 100 mM stock in H2O, final concentration in media is 1 mM. FS (F1130, Thermo Fisher), 100 or 50 mM stock in H2O, final concentration in media is 50 uM.\n\nInduction of PIN2>>AHA2delta95 and PIN2>>PP2C D1 lines was done by incubating 5 day old seedlings for 2.5 hr in 1/2 MS MES buffered media (g/l), 1% sucrose, pH 5.8 containing 2 uM estradiol before experiments.\n\nFor measurement of fluorescent spectra of FS,  MS media with 1% sucrose were prepared with pH 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0 (adjusted with KOH). FS stock (50 mM in H2O) was added to the media to achieve a final concentration of 50 uM. For the measurement, 200 ul of this media was pipetted into a 96 well plate, five wells per each pH value and the spectras were measured using Spark multimode microplate reader (Tecan). The values for each pH were averaged and plotted.\n\nTo demonstrate the wide pH reporting range of FS (Figure 1c), citric acid and sodium citrate were mixed in various ratios and water was added to obtain citrate buffers with a range of pH values. The pH of citrate buffers was measured, the buffers were mixed with agar (0.8% final concentration), boiled and FS was added (50 uM final concentration). The mixture was poured into a Petri dish. After cooling down, slabs of the solidified buffers were cut out, and placed into imaging chambers.\n\nTo measure the effects of ions and redox status (according toMartinire et al., 2013) on FS fluorescence (Figure 1 figure supplement 1e), MES buffer (1 g/l) was prepared and boiled with agar (1% final concentration), supplied with salts, H2O2, DTT, and FS was added (50 uM final concentration). The mixture was poured into a Petri dish. After cooling down, slabs of the solidified buffers were cut out, placed into imaging chambers and imaged using a spinning disk microscope, see Imaging of root surface pH. The signal intensity was measured in both 405 and 488 nm excitation channels and F488/405ratio was calculated.\n\nFor imaging of surface pH, 5 day old seedlings were transferred to unbuffered  MS, 1% sucrose, pH 5.7 (adjusted with KOH) containing 50 uM of FS +/ treatments and allowed for recovery 25 min before imaging. The medium was prepared as follows: For 100 ml of medium, 1 g of plant agar and 1 g sucrose (wt/vol) were added to 100 ml of unbuffered  MS in a 250 ml reagent bottle. The media was boiled until the agar was completely dissolved. Note: we always prepared a fresh solid medium for each experiment from a stock of liquid  MS, sucrose and agar, as re boiling the medium might affect the results. The medium was cooled to a temperature of 45 50 degreesC and FS was added to achieve 50 uM concentration. This pre solution was then divided into two equal volumes to make control and treatment medium.\n\nFor the gravitropic experiments, the seedlings were rotated +/ 90 degrees. Only roots with a starting angle of 90 degrees+/ 10 degrees were selected for analysis to obtain homogeneous gravitropic stimulations.\n\nSurface pH imaging was performed using a vertical stage Zeiss Axio Observer 7 with Zeiss Plan Apochromat 10x/0.8, coupled to a Yokogawa CSU W1 T2 spinning disk unit with 50 um pinholes and equipped with a VS401 HOM1000 excitation light homogenizer (Visitron Systems). Images were acquired using the VisiView software (Visitron Systems).\n\nFS was sequentially excited with a 488 and 405 nm laser and the emission was filtered by a 500 550 nm bandpass filter. Signal was detected using a PRIME 95B Back Illuminated sCMOS Camera (1200x1200 pixels; Photometrics). The Flat field correction mode was used for image acquisition.\n\nFor vertical growth experiments, seedlings were imaged every 10 min for 30 min. The profiles shown correspond to the first time frame while the root elongation was calculated over the whole experiment. Imaging to observe oscillations of the root surface pH was conducted by imaging every 5 s.\n\nFor gravitropic experiments, seedlings were imaged using the sandwich method (https://doi.org/10.1017/qpb.2022.4) every 2 min for 42 min. The profile shown corresponds to the last time frame except specified otherwise. The angles were quantified over the entire duration of the experiment.\n\nThe images inFigure 4gwere acquired using the Zeiss LSM 880 confocal microscope, with a 25x/0.8 water immersion objective using settings appropriate for the respective fluorophores.\n\nWhole mount immunolocalization of 5 day oldA. thalianaseedlings was performed as described previously inSauer et al., 2006, with the following modifications. The protocol was adapted to the InSituPro VS liquid handling robot (Intavis AG, Germany). Prior to immunolocalization, seedlings were fixed 1 hr with 4% paraformaldehyde dissolved in MTSB (50 mM PIPES, 5 mM EGTA, 5 mM MgSO47H2O pH 7, adjusted with KOH) at room temperature. In the robot, procedure started with 5x15 min washes with MTSB T (MTSB+0.01% Triton X 100) then the cell wall was digested by 30 min treatment at 37 degreesC with 0.05% Pectolyase Y 23 supplemented with 0.4 M mannitol in MTSB T, followed by 2x30 min membrane permeation with 10% DMSO and 3% Igepal in MTSB T. The samples were blocked 1 hr with BSA (blocking solution: 2% BSA in MTSB T) and incubated 4 hr at 37 degreesC with primary (antiAHA rabbit antibody, Agrisera AS07260, RRID:AB_1031584) and 3 hr at 37 degreesC with secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 555 goat, anti rabbit, Abcam ab150078, RRID:AB_2722519). The antibodies were diluted in 2% BSA in MTSB T in concentration: 1:500 for primary and 1:1000 for secondary antibody. Between the all described steps the seedlings were washed 5x15 min with MTSB T. For the final step, MTSB T was exchanged by deionized water. From the robot seedlings were transferred to microscopy slides into 50% glycerol in deionized water and fluorescence signal was imaged by Zeiss LSM 880 inverted confocal scanning microscope equipped with Airyscan detector with 40x/1.2 C Apochromat objective.\n\nFour day old seedlings were transferred on  MS, 1% (wt/vol) plant agar, 1% (wt/vol) sucrose, pH 5.8, covered with sterilized nylon meshes of pore sizes of 109, 119, 139 um (polyamide mesh UHELON). Plates were grown overnight vertically and then were tilted to 45 degrees and grown 24 hr. After that, the root penetration through the mesh was scored using a binocular microscope. The penetration efficiency was calculated by normalizing each variant (genotype x pore size) to the Col 0 efficiency in the 139 um variant in the particular repetition. In addition, the reference Col 0 was normalized to the Col 0 average over all repeats.\n\nWe determined root elongation by measuring the total root length increment between the first and last time frame divided by the number of minutes. The root length increment was measured with the segmented line in ImageJ/Fiji v1.53f51 (Schindelin et al., 2012). The pH along the root was automatically measured from 10 to 25 pixels off the root surface using custom Python scripts (ATR v5,https://sourceforge.net/projects/atr along the root, seeFigure 1 figure supplement 1f) averaging bins of 15*20 pixels from the fluorescence intensity of both 405 and 488 nM channels. Root angles over time were automatically measured using ACORBA v1.2 (Serre and Fendrych, 2022). Fluorescence intensity of AFB1 mCitrine and CNGC14 GFP was measured as the signal intensity along a segmented line that covered the epidermal cell file using Fiji; the intensities were then binned to 10 um bins and plotted.\n\nThe averages and SD of surface pH or alkalinization factor in function of the distance from the root tip were plotted using the Sourcecode1.py Python script. The root elongation boxplots and the associated statistics were performed using the Sourcecode2.R: R script.\n\nStatistical analyses were performed using the R software (R v4.0.2 and RStudio v1.3.1073). Boxplots represent the median and the first and third quartiles, and the whiskers extend to data points <1.5 interquartile range away from the first or third quartile; all data points are shown as individual dots. The results of the statistical tests are compiled in Supplemental statistics.\n\nThe pH surface profiles and data represented as boxplots were statistically analyzed from genotype to genotype or condition to condition using the nparcomp package (Konietschke et al., 2015). For two conditions or two genotypes comparisons, we used a non parametric Student's test. For multiple comparisons, we used a non parametric multi comparison test. For the pH surface profiles, each independent data point (a bin of pixels at a defined distance from the root tip) for the control genotype or condition were compared the same data point from the other(s) genotype(s) or condition(s) using the Sourcecode3.R or Sourcecode4.R R scripts. The results of the statistical tests for all the figures are compiled inSource data 1.\n\nSample size and biological replicates were determined as the maximum number of roots fitting the microscopy chamber, this number being influenced by the number of conditions and genotypes for a given experiment. Experiment technical replicates were arbitrarily set to three replicates. Fluorescence values were measured blindly by fully automated scripts. Data depicted in this publication represent a pool of technical and biological replicates. No technical or biological replicates were excluded from this publication.\n\nGraphics were created with the R software or in Python (v3.8) with the Seaborn plugin (v0.11.2,https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.03021) and aesthetic modifications of the graphs (fonts, size) were modified in Inkscape (v1.0).",
    "results": "To monitor the spatio temporal dynamics of root ion fluxes and apoplastic pH in vertically growing roots ofA. thaliana, we re evaluated the available fluorescence staining methods to visualize pH in roots. Cell wall staining by 8 hydroxypyrene 1,3,6 trisulfonic acid trisodium salt (HPTS) (Barbez et al., 2017) was not satisfactory in our setup, due to the very high background signal and probably due to the absence of the optimal 458 nm excitation in our vertical stage spinning disk microscope (Serre et al., 2021). However, at the transition zone of the root, we could observe an alkaline domain on the root surface (Figure 1 figure supplement 1a). Further, we attempted to visualize root surface pH using Fluorescein Dextran and Oregon Green Dextran (Figure 1 figure supplement 1a) pH reporters (Monshausen et al., 2011;Geilfus and Mhling, 2011), but the results were not satisfactory due to an artifact when roots were imaged on solid medium (Figure 1 figure supplement 1d). We therefore searched for alternative pH sensitive fluorescent dyes, and discovered Fluorescein 5 (and 6) Sulfonic Acid, Trisodium Salt (FS) (Invitrogen F1130;Seksek et al., 1995;Rosario and Rojas, 1986) as an excellent reporter of root surface pH.\n\nThe F488/405excitation ratio of FS efficiently reported pH when dissolved in liquid or solid medium (Figure 1a d,Figure 1 figure supplement 1b,c). The F488/405excitation ratio of FS is insensitive to the redox state of the medium but influenced by cation concentration (Figure 1 figure supplement 1e). FS allows to visualize pH of the root surface and the surrounding rhizosphere, without penetrating the root tissues (Figure 1e). The pH imaging with FS highlighted the previously described relatively alkaline domain in the transition zone/early elongation zone of the root (Monshausen et al., 2011;Staal et al., 2011). In addition, we observed two relatively acidic pH domains, one located in the late elongation/root hair zone and the other in the proximity of the root tip (Figure 1e). To unbiasedly quantify the root surface pH, we developed a Python based program to determine the F488/405ratio of the root surface (Figure 1 figure supplement 1f). The quantification highlighted the presence of the observed relatively alkaline and acidic domains (Figure 1f). Throughout the text, we will refer to these domains as alkaline and acidic domains, by which we mean values relatively acidic or relatively alkaline in comparison with the pH of the medium. The surface pH profile of roots shown by FS is in agreement with the data obtained using numerous electrode and microscopy measurements in several species includingA. thaliana(Zieschang et al., 1993;Staal et al., 2011;Monshausen et al., 1996;Weisenseel and Meyer, 1997). The FS pH detection range thus reveals both the alkaline and acidic domains of the root surface and allows direct and dynamic visualization of proton concentration on the root surface and its close surroundings.\n\n(a, b) The pH dependence of the excitation (a) and emission (b) spectrum of FS in liquid plant growth medium. Excitation spectra were recorded at Em = 520 nm, emission spectra were excited by Ex = 488 nm. (c) FS fluorescence in solid agar medium at indicated pH values, fluorescence excited by 488 nm, 405 nm and the F488/405excitation ratio, LUT as in (e).

The color of the root itself does reflect pH, as the root itself is not stained by FS (seeFigure 1 figure supplement 1f). The pink line shows the region in which F488/405 excitation ratio was plotted in (f). (f) The F488/405excitation ratio of FS along the longitudinal axis of the root. In (e, f), the typical root zones are depicted for illustration. The source data can be found inFigure 1 source data 1.\n\nWe first hypothesized that the observed spatial surface pH gradients might originate from gradients of AHA ATPase abundance or activity (Groeholz et al., 2022). We therefore immunolocalized endogenous AHAs using the antibody which recognizes multiple AHA ATPases paralogs in multiple plant species (Agrisera AS07260). To test the specificity of the antibody inArabidopsisroots, we imaged Col 0 roots,aha2 4mutants lacking the dominant AHA2 paralogue, and lines inducibly expressing a dominant version of AHA2 (AHA2 d95 mScarlet). The antibody showed signal in the PM in Col 0 andaha2 4roots (Figure 2 figure supplement 1a and b). When we inducibly overexpressed the AHA2 d95 mScarlet, we detected colocalization of the mScarlet signal with the antibody signal (Figure 2 figure supplement 1c). These results indicate that the antibody recognized multiple plasma membrane localized AHAs inArabidopsisroots. The immunolocalization of endogenous AHAs, however, didn't reveal any obvious absence of AHAs in the transition zone (Figure 2a,Figure 2 figure supplement 1d) that would explain the presence of the alkaline domain. To overcome the hypothetical lack of AHA activation in the TZ, we treated seedlings with fusicoccin (FC), a fungal toxin that stimulates the AHA's activity (Ballio et al., 1964) and thus increases proton efflux. FC lowered the surface pH of the root acidic domains but, surprisingly, did not affect the alkaline domain (Figure 2b and c). This partial acidification was correlated with the known FC induced stimulation of root growth (Figure 2 figure supplement 2a).\n\n(a) Immunostaining of AHA proton pumps in the Col 0 root transition zone (arrowhead). Scale bar = 20 um. (b,c) Root surface pH visualized by FS of wild type (WT) Col 0 seedlings treated with 0 uM (control) or 2 uM fusicoccin.

(e) Representative images (scale bar = 100 um), and (f) quantifications of FS F488/405 excitation ratio profile. For (c) and (f), the bars above the curves mark regions with non significant (ns) and significant (*: p value <0.05) statistical difference in comparison to control. The source data can be found inFigure 2 source data 1.\n\nTo exclude an FC independent regulation of AHAs in the TZ, we createdA. thalianalines inducibly expressing a fluorescently tagged hyperactive version of AHA2 (Pacheco Villalobos et al., 2016)   AHA2 d95 mScarlet, and lines expressing an inhibitor of AHAs PP2CD1 mScarlet (Ren et al., 2018) under the control of the epidermal/cortex PIN2 promoter (Figure 2d). Expression of hyperactive AHA2 increased the acidic domain in the root tip, slightly reduced the alkaline domain, but did not prevent its formation (Figure 2e and f). This restricted acidification led to a tendency to stimulate root growth (Figure 2 figure supplement 2b).\n\nInhibition of AHA activity by overexpression of PP2C D1 raised the overall root tip surface pH, but did not prevent the formation of the alkaline domain in the TZ (Figure 2e and f). Alkalinization of the root tip surface correlated with a statistically insignificant reduction of root growth (Figure 2 figure supplement 2b). We further measured the root surface pH profile ofaha2andpp2c d triplemutants that showed decreased (Haruta and Sussman, 2012) and increased (Ren et al., 2018) AHA activity, respectively. Plants lacking the expression of PP2CDs showed a significantly acidified root tip surface, however, the alkaline halo remained unaffected (Figure 2 figure supplement 2f and h). On the other hand, plants lacking the expression of AHA2 were slightly impaired in the alkaline halo domain formation (Figure 2 figure supplement 2f and h).aha2 4roots were growing slower than Col 0 whilepp2c d tripleroot growth was stimulated (Figure 2 figure supplement 2g).\n\nThe manipulation of the AHA proton pump activity resulted in the expected outcome of influencing the overall root surface pH and root growth. However, the spatial organization of the root surface pH profile with the alkaline domain of the TZ does not appear to be simply controlled by the activation or abundance of AHAs, as the alkaline domain cannot be fully removed by genetic or pharmacological modulation of the proton pumping activity.\n\nIt is well established that the application of auxin to roots causes an increase in apoplastic and root surface pH (Monshausen et al., 2011;Shih et al., 2015;Li et al., 2021). To investigate the effect of auxin application on surface pH profile and formation of the TZ alkaline domain, we analyzed surface pH in response to the native auxin indole 3 acetic acid (IAA). With the increasing IAA concentration, the alkaline domain pH rose and the domain expanded toward the elongation zone of the root, which resulted in disappearance of the acidic domain (Figure 3a and b). The extent of the surface alkalinization correlated with IAA induced root growth inhibition; the response was detectable at 1 nM IAA and was saturated between 100 and 1000 nM IAA (Figure 3c). This implies that the entire root surface is capable of alkalinization upon external auxin treatment, and that the alkaline domain is the hotspot of auxin response.\n\n(a c) Surface pH correlates with growth rate dose response of Col 0 roots to indole 3 acetic acid (IAA) auxin. (a) Representative images of root surface pH visualized by FS after 20 min IAA treatment. (b) Quantifications of FS F488/405 excitation ratio profile. (c) Root elongation rate (um/min) measured over a 40 min period. (d f) Root surface pH visualized by FS of Col 0,aux1andpin2mutants after 20 min treatment with 0 or 100 nM IAA. (d) Representative images. (e) Quantification of FS F488/405 excitation ratio profile in (e) control condition and (f) in response to 100 nM IAA. For (b,e,f), the bars above the curves mark regions with non significant (ns) and significant (*: p value <0.05) statistical difference in comparison to control. For (c), *: p value <0.05, ***: p value <0.0005. Scale bars = 100 um. The source data can be found inFigure 3 source data 1.\n\nWe further analyzed the root surface pH response to IAA in line with altered AHA activity. The PIN2>>AHA2 d95 and PIN2>>PP2 CD1 (Figure 2 figure supplement 2c and d) as well as thepp2c d triplemutant responded to IAA treatment by alkalinization of the root surface pH (Figure 2 figure supplement 2h and i). The alkalinization factors (a measure of IAA induced alkalinization) were similar to Col 0 with the exception of the very root tip ofpp2c d triplewhich responded slightly less (Figure 2 figure supplement 2e and j). These results were correlated with control level IAA induced root growth inhibition (Figure 2 figure supplement 2b and g). On the other hand, knockout mutation of AHA2 led to reduced IAA induced root surface alkalinization (Figure 2 figure supplement 2h, i and j), but strong enough to observe an auxin induced root growth inhibition (Figure 2 figure supplement 2g). The alkaline domain does not seem to be caused by the lack of proton efflux in the TZ, and the amplitude of the alkaline domain can be increased by auxin application. We therefore tested how auxin transport, perception, and response contribute to the spatial determination of root surface pH. First, we tested the mutant in the PIN2 auxin efflux carrier, in which the shootward auxin flux through the outer root tissues is perturbed (Luschnig et al., 1998;Mller et al., 1998). Thepin2mutant root showed a reduced alkaline domain that was shifted toward the root tip (Figure 3d and e). Upon application of 10 nM IAA topin2mutant, the alkaline domain position and amplitude were partially restored (Figure 3 figure supplement 1a and b), thepin2roots also responded to auxin by growth inhibition (Figure 3 figure supplement 1c). Upon treatment with 100 nM IAA, the alkaline domain and the overall IAA induced root alkalinization were fully restored (Figure 3d and fandFigure 3 figure supplement 1d and e).\n\nThe auxin influx carrier AUX1 is essential for auxin uptake and transport during root gravitropism (Swarup et al., 2005;Band et al., 2014), and the nullaux1mutant was shown to have a more acidic surface with an altered root tip pH profile (Monshausen et al., 2011). We determined the root surface pH profile in theaux1mutant, and found that its pH showed a gradual decrease from the tip toward the root hair zone. While the acidic zone in the elongation zone was comparable to control roots,aux1mutants displayed a complete absence of the TZ alkaline domain (Figure 3d and e). Application of 10 nM IAA onaux1mutants did not affect root elongation (Figure 3 figure supplement 1c) and did not trigger a root surface alkalinization in contrast to the control Col 0 (Figure 3 figure supplement 1a and b). However, at 100 nM IAA, when IAA diffusion compensates for AUX1 function (Evans et al., 1994),aux1mutant showed a clear IAA induced root growth inhibition (Figure 3 figure supplement 1e) as well as an increased root surface pH beyond the TZ (Figure 3d and fandFigure 3 figure supplement 1d). The wild type (WT) like root surface pH profile was, however, not restored by IAA application, demonstrating that AUX1 is essential for creating the alkaline surface domain in the transition zone.\n\nAs the immunolocalization pattern of AHAs in theaux1mutant was comparable to the Col 0 control (Figure 2 figure supplement 1d), we treated the mutant with FC to investigate the activation status of AHAs in theaux1mutant. Interestingly, this treatment resulted in the establishment of a small alkaline domain also in theaux1mutant (Figure 3 figure supplement 1f and h), likely caused by AHA mediated acidification in the root tip and the distal elongation zone that did not affect the TZ surface pH. The partial acidification was again correlated with a significant root growth stimulation (Figure 3 figure supplement 1g). This experiment showed that AHAs are not fully activated inaux1mutant and implies a specific surface pH response of the cells of the TZ. In summary, we have shown that the distinctive alkaline domain at the transition zone of the root depends on AUX1 mediated auxin influx. Without auxin influx, the root shows a linear acidification gradient from the root tip to the maturation zone.\n\nOnce in the cytoplasm, auxin triggers responses either through the canonical auxin signaling pathway or the auxin rapid response pathway (Dubey et al., 2021). We examined the involvement of these pathways in the establishment of the surface pH profile of the root. First, we investigated the components of the canonical auxin signaling by using thetir1,afb2,3 (tir triple) mutant which lacks the expression of three of the six known auxin receptors (Dharmasiri et al., 2005). Thetir triplemutant displayed a more acidic surface pH, particularly in the elongation and maturation zone (Figure 4a and b). However, it was still displaying an alkaline domain, albeit less pronounced than the control. In response to IAA,tir triplewas critically impaired in whole root IAA induced surface pH alkalinization (Figure 4 figure supplement 1b and c). As a result,tir triplewas also impaired in the IAA induced root growth inhibition (Figure 4 figure supplement 1a). These results confirm that the canonical auxin signaling is involved in the auxin induced apoplastic alkalinization (Li et al., 2021) and also partially in the longitudinal surface pH zonation. Next, to test the role of the TMK1 ABP1 apoplastic auxin perception pathway (Li et al., 2021;Friml et al., 2022) in the establishment of root surface pH profile, we analyzed the root surface pH profiles oftmk1,tmk4, andabp1mutants. The surface pH profile of the mutants was, however, comparable to the Col 0 controls (Figure 4 figure supplement 1d, e and f).\n\n(a, b) Root surface pH of Col 0 andtir triplemutant after 20 min treatment with 0 or 10 nM indole 3 acetic acid (IAA).

The source data can be found inFigure 4 source data 1.\n\nWe further explored the role of the recently discovered molecular actors of the auxin rapid response   AFB1 and CNGC14. AFB1 is the paralogue of the TIR1 receptor; AFB1 has been shown to be crucial for the rapid growth inhibition upon auxin treatment, rapid auxin induced membrane depolarization, and for the early response to gravistimulation (Prigge et al., 2020;Serre et al., 2021). Similarly, the mutant in the calcium channel CNGC14 lacks the auxin induced calcium transient, membrane depolarization, and shows a delay in the early gravitropic response (Shih et al., 2015;Dindas et al., 2018). We analyzed the root surface pH of both mutants and found a more acidic root surface with a critically flat alkaline domain in theafb1mutant (Figure 4c and dandFigure 4 figure supplement 2a) as well as in thecngc14mutant (Figure 4e and fandFigure 4 figure supplement 2b). We confirmed the similar result in additional alleles ofafb1(Figure 4 figure supplement 2c) andcngc14mutants (Figure 4 figure supplement 2d). This shows that these proteins, apart from controlling the rapid auxin response, steer the pH profile of the root during normal steady state growth by controlling the alkaline domain in the transition zone. The lack of the alkaline domain was not caused by mislocalization or absence of AUX1 protein in theafb1orcngc14mutants (Figure 4 figure supplement 2e). Similarly to theaux1mutant, the localization of AHA H+ATPases in both mutants was not obviously different from the Col 0 control (Figure 2 figure supplement 1d). We further tested how theafb1andcngc14mutants respond to IAA and found an overall alkalinization of the root surface with a partial rescue of the alkaline domain (Figure 4d and f) and partially impaired growth inhibition (Figure 4 figure supplement 2f h).\n\nWhat makes the TZ zone surface pH different from the other domains of the roots? A plausible explanation is the localization of relevant molecular components in this region of the root. The auxin transporters AUX1 and PIN2 have been shown to localize to the lateral root cap and epidermis (Mller et al., 1998;Swarup et al., 2004,Figure 4g).Prigge et al., 2020, showed that AFB1 is expressed in the root tip and we could see an enrichment of the protein in the root epidermis (Figure 4g). To determine the localization of CNGC14, we expressed its fluorescently C terminally tagged version under the control of its native promoter. The expression of CNGC14 fusion protein was rather weak, and localized to the PM of root epidermal cells, with an enrichment in the transition zone (Figure 4g and h). The expression of AFB1 mCitrine and CNGC14 GFP in the respective mutants recovered the presence of the TZ alkaline domain (Figure 4c, d, e and fandFigure 4 figure supplement 2a, b and d). Interestingly, the expression of CNGC14 GFP incngc14caused an exaggerated TZ alkaline domain (Figure 4e and fandFigure 4 figure supplement 2b and d), which underlines the importance of the CNGC14 calcium channel in the establishment of root surface pH profile.\n\nThese results show that the signaling components so far associated with the rapid auxin response are expressed in the root epidermis and contribute to the longitudinal zonation of root surface pH profile. The alkaline domain of the TZ represents a site of a constant rapid auxin response that is triggered by the internal auxin fluxes mediated by AUX1 and PIN2 transporters. On the other hand, the overall increase of root surface pH upon auxin treatment can be attributed to the TIR1 canonical signaling pathway.\n\nIt was shown that auxin induces alkalinization of the apoplastic pH and that this alkalinization correlates and is required for the inhibition of root growth. The same process occurs during the gravitropic response   the lower root side responds to the internal auxin by alkalinization, resulting in root bending (Monshausen et al., 2011;Shih et al., 2015;Barbez et al., 2017). We reanalyzed the root surface pH using our pH imaging and quantifications, as it enables us to monitor alkalinization, as well as acidification of the root surface. Upon gravistimulation, the TZ alkaline domain on the lower side of the root increased rapidly, while on the upper side, the alkaline domain diminished and the root surface acidified (Figure 5a,Video 1). This led to a gradient of surface pH across the root that was established within 5 min of the gravistimulation which correlated with initiation of bending of the root (Figure 5a). The disappearance of the alkaline halo on the upper root surface indicates that the TZ domain might act as a zone of stalled growth which is rapidly activated upon gravistimulation. We further analyzed the gravitropic responses of the mutants with altered root surface pH zonation. As expected, the agravitropicaux1mutant did not create a pH gradient across the root and did not bend (Figure 5b). Manipulation of the AHA activity by the application of FC or by genetic means did not prevent the formation of a gradient of surface pH and rapid bending of the root (Figure 5 figure supplement 1a and b). Finally, theafb1andcngc14mutants showed a slower gravitropic response, as reported before (Serre et al., 2021;Shih et al., 2015;Figure 5c and d). As both mutants have a diminished alkaline domain in the TZ, upon gravistimulation, this zone could not rapidly react to change in auxin fluxes; instead, a shallow gradient of surface pH slowly develops in the mutants (Figure 5c and d).\n\n(a c) Surface pH dynamics and root tip bending angle during gravitropic response in (a) Col 0, (b) Col 0 andaux1, (c) Col 0 andafb1 3, (d) Col 0 andcngc14 1lines.

In theaux1,afb1, andcngc14mutants, the alkaline domain was absent or less prominent during vertical growth (Video 3). This result and the fact that the components of the rapid auxin response pathway are involved in the formation of the alkaline domain indicates that, in this zone, the cells continuously rapidly respond to the internal auxin fluxes, and that this pathway is active not only upon gravistimulation. We hypothesized that the significance of this process is to constantly correct the growth rate fluctuations and to enable the root to quickly regulate the growth direction of the root tip. This would be particularly relevant in the soil environment, where the root tip penetrates the soil particles and constantly corrects growth direction using the gravity vector. To test this hypothesis, we tested the ability of WT andaux1,afb1,andcngc14mutants to navigate through artificial obstacles, approximated by tilted agar plates covered with a rectangular nylon grid. We scored the efficiency of the roots in penetrating the grids with varying pore sizes (Figure 5f). WT plants penetrated the meshes more efficiently as the pore size increased, whereas the agravitropicaux1mutant failed to penetrate in all conditions. Interestingly, both theafb1andcngc14mutants showed a significant decrease in penetration efficiency compared to the WT (Figure 5g).\n\nDownload video stream.\n\nDownload video stream.\n\nThe movie is assembled from individual movies, the lookup table is set identically for all genotypes.\n\nIn summary, the alkaline surface pH domain originates from a constant rapid auxin response driven by the AUX1 AFB1 CNGC14 module. This response enables the roots to rapidly react to gravity vector changes and to adjust the root tip growth direction.",
    "discussion": "In this work, we present a new method to determine the root surface pH ofA. thaliana. Its advantage is the sensitivity of FS in lower pH range that enables a spectacular visualization of root surface pH, including the acidic domain surrounding the late elongation and maturation zones of roots, which was not detected with the previously published methods (Monshausen et al., 2011;Shih et al., 2015). FS is an inexpensive dye which can be excited by the common 405 and 488 nm laser lines. In this work, we avoided measuring absolute pH values; instead, we determined the relative pH compared to internal controls observed on the same medium. Absolute pH determination would be possible, if extensive pH calibration was performed during each imaging session. This approach would be very laborious, and, in addition, absolute fluorescence intensities might depend on the thickness of the layer of medium and many other parameters. Therefore, we recommend using FS to determine relative pH changes compared to internal controls, that is WT plants or mock controls imaged together with mutants or treated roots. We showed that apart from pH, FS can also react to other ions, however, given that the surface pH profile visualized by FS staining is in full accordance with the previously published works (Weisenseel and Meyer, 1997;Weisenseel et al., 1979;Bjrkman and Leopold, 1987;Behrens et al., 1982;Iwabuchi et al., 1989;Staal et al., 2011), we conclude that in the growth media, FS reflects primarily the root surface pH.\n\nAccording to the acid growth theory, acidic pH enables cell wall extension (Rayle and Cleland, 1992;Hager, 2003). We observed the lowest pH values in the very tip of the root and in the maturation zone where cells do not elongate. On the other hand, the alkaline domain partially covers the early elongation zone. The surface pH therefore does not fully correlate with the local growth rates (Beemster and Baskin, 1998;Shih et al., 2015). In addition, it remains to be resolved to what extent the surface pH correlates with the pH of the cell walls and the apoplastic space of the root epidermal cells, as previous work has reported a correlation between cell length and cell wall pH (Barbez et al., 2017;Moreau et al., 2022). It is possible that rather than driving cell elongation, the acidic domain in the maturation zone plays a role in nutrient acquisition and absorption by the root hairs (Martn Barranco et al., 2021). The cytokinin mediated cell wall stiffening may become the dominant growth regulating mechanism in this root zone, leading to growth cessation despite low extracellular pH (Liu et al., 2022).\n\nBased on genetic and pharmacological experiments we concluded that the longitudinal surface pH zonation is not based solely on the activity and abundance of PM AHA H+ATPases, but instead, the alkaline domain in the transition zone is driven by AUX1 mediated auxin influx and AFB1 signaling. The surface pH might be determined solely by AHA activity in the specific case of theaux1mutant, where the pH progressively decreases in the shootward direction, and might then reflect the AHA activity gradient that is determined by the abundance of the proton pumps and their regulation by brassinosteroid signaling, as suggested byGroeholz et al., 2022. Interestingly, even in theaux1mutant, a residual AHA independent alkaline domain is present and can be visualized when AHAs are hyperactivated by the application of FC.\n\nIn agreement with these results, the ectopic AHA ATPases activation also cannot prevent the auxin induced growth inhibition and the gravitropic bending of roots. Inhibition of AHA activity led to slower growth, a tendency of slower gravitropic response, and theaha2 4mutation caused a reduced auxin induced surface alkalinization. In addition to controlling membrane potential and apoplastic pH, AHA activity influences auxin signaling by regulating auxin influx and diffusion into cells (Rubery and Sheldrake, 1973;Yang et al., 2006). These results might thus be caused by the reduced proton motive force that in turn might interfere with IAA uptake into the cells.\n\nWhat is the cause of the alkaline domain at the transition zone, if not the inhibition of AHA ATPase activity? It was shown that the auxin induced apoplast and root surface alkalinization is accompanied by a decrease in cytosolic pH (Monshausen et al., 2011;Li et al., 2021), indicating that the alkaline domain visualized by the FS is caused by a proton influx into cells. The phenotype of theaux1mutant hints to the possibility that the AUX1 mediated auxin symport with protons (Lomax et al., 1985) might cause the observed root surface alkalinization. Also supporting this hypothesis, the transition zone of maize roots is the site of the highest auxin influx, as measured by an auxin specific electrode (Mancuso et al., 2005). On the other hand, theaux1mutant was capable of surface alkalinization when higher concentrations of IAA were added, demonstrating that the AUX1 mediated influx per se is not required for surface alkalinization. Further, theafb1mutants show a defect in the alkaline domain formation, which favors the explanation that the auxin induced alkalinization is triggered from the AFB1 receptor. Given that the mutant in CNGC14 is defective in establishing root surface pH profile, auxin induced alkalinization and auxin induced calcium influx (Shih et al., 2015), and calcium influx and pH changes are tightly coupled (Behera et al., 2018), we conclude that CNGC14 functions downstream of AFB1. Similarly,Li et al., 2021, suggested that auxin induced alkalinization of the apoplast is mediated by a yet unknown mechanism. It is intriguing to speculate that the signaling pathway might operate via the adenylate cyclase activity of TIR1/AFB auxin receptors (Qi et al., 2022).\n\nWe show that the rapid auxin response pathway, so far connected with the reaction to auxin application (Fendrych et al., 2018;Li et al., 2021;Monshausen et al., 2011) or the gravitropic response (Serre et al., 2021;Shih et al., 2015), operates constantly in the growingA. thalianaroot. Even though the other TIR1/AFB co receptors partially contribute to the longitudinal surface pH zonation, AFB1 plays the most important role. The other TIR1/AFB receptors seem to be more important for the overall pH rise upon the application of IAA, in agreement with the results ofLi et al., 2021. The localization of the alkaline zone seems to be determined by the intersection of the PIN2 mediated shootward auxin flux (Luschnig et al., 1998;Mller et al., 1998), localization of the AUX1 mediated auxin influx (Swarup et al., 2005;Band et al., 2014), and the enrichment of the AFB1 and CNGC14 proteins. We propose that the dynamic nature of the surface alkalinization observed by us and others (Monshausen et al., 2011;Shih et al., 2015) results from the interaction of the intensity of the auxin flux and the constant rapid response that occurs in the alkaline domain of the root tip. In addition, the auxin induced alkalinization is constantly being counterbalanced by the TMK mediated AHA ATPase activation and apoplast acidification (Li et al., 2021;Friml et al., 2022;Lin et al., 2021).\n\nUpon gravistimulation, the alkaline domain on the lower side of the root increased rapidly, while on the upper side, the alkaline domain diminished and the root surface acidified, which is consistent with previous pH measurements done by electrodes (Zieschang et al., 1993;Monshausen et al., 1996), indicating that the alkaline domain corresponds to a zone of a stalled cell elongation that can be rapidly regulated upon gravistimulation. In addition to the gene expression changes that occur during obstacle avoidance (Jacobsen et al., 2021) and the FERONIA mediated mechanoperception (Shih et al., 2014), the rapid auxin response module in the root decreases the reaction time of the root to the changes of root growth direction, and thus increases the efficiency of root soil penetration.",
