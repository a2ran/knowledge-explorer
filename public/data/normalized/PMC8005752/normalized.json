    "abstract": "Four strains belonging to the family ofMethylobacteriaceaewere isolated from different locations on the International Space Station (ISS) across two consecutive flights. Of these, three were identified as Gram negative, rod shaped, catalase positive, oxidase positive, motile bacteria, designated as IF7SW B2T, IIF1SW B5, and IIF4SW B5, whereas the fourth was identified asMethylorubrum rhodesianum. The sequence similarity of these three ISS strains, designated as IF7SW B2T, IIF1SW B5, and IIF4SW B5, was <99.4% for 16S rRNA genes and <97.3% forgyrBgene, with the closest beingMethylobacterium indicumSE2.11T. Furthermore, the multi locus sequence analysis placed these three ISS strains in the same clade ofM. indicum.The average nucleotide identity (ANI) values of these three ISS strains were <93% and digital DNA DNA hybridization (dDDH) values were <46.4% with any describedMethylobacteriumspecies. Based on the ANI and dDDH analyses, these three ISS strains were considered as novel species belonging to the genusMethylobacterium.The three ISS strains showed 100% ANI similarity and dDDH values with each other, indicating that these three ISS strains, isolated during various flights and from different locations, belong to the same species. These three ISS strains were found to grow optimally at temperatures from 25 to 30 degreesC, pH 6.0 to 8.0, and NaCl 0 to 1%. Phenotypically, these three ISS strains resembleM. aquaticumandM. terraesince they assimilate similar sugars as sole carbon substrate when compared to otherMethylobacteriumspecies. Fatty acid analysis showed that the major fatty acid produced by the ISS strains are C18:1 7cand C18:1 6c. The predominant quinone was ubiquinone 10, and the major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, and an unidentified lipid. Therefore, based on genomic, phylogenetic, biochemical, and fatty acid analyses, strains IF7SW B2T, IIF1SW B5, and IIF4SW B5, are assigned to a novel species within the genusMethylobacterium, and the nameMethylobacterium ajmaliisp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is IF7SW B2T(NRRL B 65601Tand LMG 32165T).\n\nKeywords:Methylobacterium, polyphasic taxomony, ANI, international space station (ISS), whole genome sequencing",
    "methods": "Several surface samples (1 m2) were collected from the ISS during Microbial Tracking 1 flight experiments from 2015 to 2016. Sample collection, processing, and isolation of cultivable microorganisms were published elsewhere (Checinska Sielaff et al., 2019). Briefly, the polyester wipes used to collect samples and particulates associated with the sampling devices were transported to Earth before being disassociated into sterile phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4) solution and plated onto R2A agar medium (Checinska et al., 2015;Checinska Sielaff et al., 2019). The microbial cultures that were grown at 25 degreesC for 7 days were picked from the R2A plates, purified, and stored for further analyses. Distinct colonies (n= 4) isolated from three different locations and from a high efficiency particulate arrestance (HEPA) filter were characterized during this study. These colonies exhibited unique coloration and differential genomic phylogeny. The type strain IF7SW B2Twas isolated during Flight 1 (March 2015) at Location #7, the Overhead 3 panel surface of the Materials Science Research Rack 1, which is used for basic materials research in the microgravity environment of the ISS. The second strain, IIF1SW B5, was isolated during Flight 2 (May 2015) at Location #1, the Port panel of the Cupola. The Cupola is a small module devoted to the observation of operations outside the ISS, such as robotic activities, spacecraft approaches, and extravehicular activities. The third strain, IIF4SW B5, was isolated during Flight 2 (May 2015) at Location #4, the surface of the dining table. Even though the main function of the table was for dining, crewmembers also used the table for experimental work. The fourth strain was I1 R3, isolated from the ISS HEPA filter that was returned aboard STS 134/ULF6 in May 2011 and archived as reported earlier (Checinska et al., 2015).\n\nA biomass of approximately 1 ug wet weight was collected for DNA extraction from each strain after growing on R2A medium at 25 degreesC for 3 days. Total nucleic acid extraction was carried out using ZymoBIOMICS 96 MagBead DNA kit (lysis tubes) (Zymo Research, United States) after bead beating with a Bertin Precellys homogenizer. This was followed by library preparation using the Illumina Nextera Flex Protocol as per Illumina document number 1000000025416 v07. The initial amount of DNA for library preparation was quantified, and 5 to 12 cycles of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification were carried out to normalize the output depending on the input DNA concentration. The amplified genomic DNA fragments were indexed and pooled in 384 plex configuration. Whole genome shotgun sequencing was performed on a NovaSeq 6000 S4 flowcell PE 2 x 150 platform with a paired end module. The data were filtered with NGS QC Toolkit v2.3 (Patel and Jain, 2012) for high quality (HQ) vector  and adaptor free reads for genome assembly (cutoff read length for HQ, 80%; cutoff quality score, 20). The number of filtered reads obtained were used for assembly with SPAdes 3.14.0 (Bankevich et al., 2012) genome assembler (k mer size  32 to 72 bases) using default parameters. The genome was annotated using the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline 4.11 (Tatusova et al., 2016;Haft et al., 2018). In addition, functional annotation of genome and seed categories were assigned to the genome by implementing the Rapid Annotations using Subsystems Technology (RAST) tool (Aziz et al., 2008).\n\nGenomes of all other strains used in this study were downloaded from NCBI, and the genomic relatedness of ISS strains was identified based on average nucleotide identity (ANI; FastANI) calculations (Jain et al., 2018) and digital DNA DNA hybridization (dDDH) analysis (Meier Kolthoff et al., 2013). FastANI was run on all the genomes using the default parameters: Mashmap identity cutoffI0= 80%, non overlapping fragments of sizel=3Kb, and minimum count of reciprocal mappings= 50.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis was carried out based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and MLSA using six housekeeping genes: ATP synthase F1 beta subunit (atpD), DNA strand exchange and recombination gene (recA), chaperone gene (dnaK), DNA directed RNA polymerase subunit beta (rpoB), glutamine synthetase type I (glnI), and DNA gyrase subunit B (gyrB), for differentiatingMethylobacteriumspecies (Green and Ardley, 2018). The 16S rRNA gene sequences of type strains of all 45Methylobacteriumspecies were included in the phylogenetic analysis. In addition, representative species of genusMethylorubrum,Enterovirga,Microvirga, andNeomegalonemafrom familyMethylobacteriaceae,Rhizobiumfrom orderRhizobiales,Caulobacterfrom orderCaulobacterales, in classAlphaproteobacteriawere included.Pseudomonas aeruginosawas selected as the outgroup.\n\nThe 16S rRNA gene sequences of all strains were retrieved from NCBI except for the four ISS strains, which were recovered from their respective WGS. Phylogenetic analysis based on housekeeping genes and MLSA was carried out with type strains of 24Methylobacteriumspecies and representative species of other genera. All the gene sequences were retrieved from the genome sequences using RAST v2.01(Aziz et al., 2008;Overbeek et al., 2014;Brettin et al., 2015). The individual gene sequences for all strains were aligned separately using ClustalW, and then the maximum likelihood tree was generated using MEGA 7.0.26 (Kumar S. et al., 2016). For MLSA, six housekeeping gene sequences for each strain were concatenated manually and aligned using ClustalW, and then the maximum likelihood tree was generated using MEGA 7.0.26 (Kumar S. et al., 2016).\n\nThe genome based tree for theMethylobacteriumspecies, including ISS strains and representative species of other genus with available WGS, was constructed using GToTree (Lee, 2019). This tool takes the complete/draft genomes as input and creates a phylogenomic tree based on the prespecified single copy gene set using a hidden Markov model (HMM); the tool currently has 2,044 unique HMM set as identifiers to cover all three domains of microbial life.\n\nPhenotypic characterization was performed according to standard protocols (Jones, 1981). Growth of the ISS strains at different temperatures (7, 25, 30, 37, and 45 degreesC) was assessed after incubation on nutrient agar (Sigma, United States) for 7 days. Growth at different pH (4.0 10.0 at intervals of 1.0) was assessed after incubation in nutrient broth (Sigma, United States) at 30 degreesC for 7 days. The pH of the nutrient medium was adjusted using citrate/NaH2PO4buffer (pH 4.0 5.0), phosphate buffer (pH 6.0 8.0), and tris buffer (pH 9.0 10.0) (Kim et al., 2019). Salt tolerance was tested by streaking the strains on R2A supplemented with NaCl (0 10% at intervals of 1%) and incubating the plates at 30 degreesC for 7 days. Motility was assessed via the \"hanging drop\" method by observing the culture under a light microscope (Tindall et al., 2007). Catalase activity was tested by adding 3% hydrogen peroxide to culture grown on R2A at 30 degreesC for 7 days, and effervescence was monitored (Tindall et al., 2007). An oxidase test was carried out in a filter paper soaked with the substrate tetramethyl p phenylenediamine dihydrochloride, and coloration was documented (Jurtshuk Jr. and McQuitty, 1976). All other physiological and biochemical tests were carried out using API 20 NE, API 50 CH, and API ZYM kits as per manufacturer's procedures (bioMrieux, France).\n\nAll strains grown in the R2A broth were harvested when growth of the cultures reached around 70% of the maximal optical density (exponential growth phase), and then the cultures were used for analyses of cellular fatty acids, polar lipids, and quinones, which were carried out as described previously (Ramaprasad et al., 2015). Briefly, for cellular fatty acids analysis, 40 mg of bacterial cell pellet from each strain was subjected to a series of four different reagents followed by saponification and methylation of fatty acids, thus enabling their cleavage from lipids. The fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) thus obtained were analyzed by a gas chromatograph equipped with Sherlock MIS software (Microbial ID; MIDI 6.0 version; Agilent: 6850)2. The peaks obtained were then labeled, and the equivalent chain length (ECL) values were computed by the Sherlock software.\n\nThe polar lipids profile was analyzed by extracting cells with methanol chloroform saline (2:1:0.8, v/v/v) from 1 g of freeze dried bacterial cells. Separation of lipids was performed by two dimensional chromatography on a silica gel thin layer chromatography plate (Kieselgel 60 F254; Merck) using chloroform methanol water (75:32:4, v/v/v) in the first dimension and chloroform methanol acetic acid water (86:16:15:4, v/v/v/v) in the second dimension. The total polar lipids profile was detected by spraying with 6% ethanolic molybdophosphoric acid. The respiratory isoprenoid quinone was extracted with a chloroform methanol mixture (2:1, v/v), evaporated under vacuum, re extracted with acetone, and analyzed using high performance lipid chromatography as per established methods (Ramaprasad et al., 2018).",
    "results": "This study reports the isolation and identification of four strains belonging to the familyMethylobacteriaceae, collected from different locations on the ISS. Three of the strains, referred to as IF7SW B2T, IIF1SW B5, and IIF4SW B5, were identified based on the traditional and genomic taxonomic approaches. The fourth strain, which was isolated from a HEPA filter and referred to as I1 R3, was identified based on genomic analyses only.\n\nTo confirm that three of the ISS strains (IF7SW B2T, IIF1SW B5, and IIF4SW B5) belong to a novel species, their phylogenetic affiliations were analyzed with other species belonging to the genusMethylobacterium. The sequence similarity of these three ISS strains with validly describedMethylobacteriumspecies was <99.4% for 16S rRNA gene (Supplementary Table 1) and <97.3% forgyrBgene with the closest beingM. indicumSE2.11T. Phylogenetic analysis of these three ISS strains was carried out by constructing a maximum likelihood tree based on 16S rRNA (Figure 1),gyrB(Figure 2),atpD(Supplementary Figure 1),recA(Supplementary Figure 2),dnaK(Supplementary Figure 3),rpoB(Supplementary Figure 4), andglnI(Supplementary Figure 5) gene sequences. In addition, MLSA was carried out by concatenating the six housekeeping genes manually (Figure 3). In addition, a phylogenetic tree based on WGS was generated (Figure 4). The phylogenetic trees constructed based on all these genes, MLSA, and WGS showed that these three ISS strains (IF7SW B2T, IIF1SW B5, and IIF4SW B5) are clustered together and in the same clade withM. indicumSE2.11T. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing, housekeeping gene based analyses, MLSA, and genome based tree further supported the concept that these three ISS strains belong to the same species but are closely related toM. indicum. In addition, the identity of the ISS strain I1 R3 was further confirmed to beM. rhodesianumbased on its 16S rRNA gene (Figure 1) andgyrB(Figure 2) phylogenetic affiliation to the type strainM. rhodesianumDSM 5687T.\n\nMaximum likelihood phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA gene sequences shows the relationship ofMethylobacterium ajmaliisp. nov. with members of the familyMethylobacteriaceae.

Bar, 0.05 substitution per site.\n\nGenome based phylogenetic tree showing the phylogenetic relationship ofMethylobacterium ajmaliisp. nov. with members of the familyMethylobacteriaceae.\n\nThe genomes of the four isolated ISS strains were sequenced, with their draft genome assembled and annotated. The results are summarized inTable 1. The genome varied in size from 6.1 to 6.8 Mbp with GC content between 68 and 71%, similar to other members of the familyMethylobacteriaceae.\n\nSummary of the draft whole genome sequences of four strains belonging to the familyMethylobacteriaceae, isolated from the ISS.\n\nDue to higher sequence similarities of three ISS strains withM. indicumSE2.11T(99.4% for 16S rRNA gene and 97.3% forgyrB gene), the draft genomes of three ISS strains were subjected to ANI and dDDH analysis with other species belonging to familyMethylobacteriaceae(Table 2). The ANI indices of three ISS strains (IF7SW B2T, IIF1SW B5, and IIF4SW B5) withM. indicumSE2.11Twere 92.7 to 93%, and dDDH values were 45.8 to 46.4%. The ANI and dDDH values obtained for three ISS strains with otherMethylobacteriumspecies were below the threshold of 95% ANI (Yoon et al., 2017) and 70% dDDH values (Auch et al., 2010), which were established for prokaryotic species delineation. This suggested that these three ISS strains are novel species of the genusMethylobacterium. These three ISS strains exhibited ANI and dDDH values around 99 100% with each other, indicating that they belong to the same species. The entire genomes of these three ISS strains,M. indicumSE2.11T, andM. plataniPMB02Twere aligned to detect their divergence and similarity using the MUMmer 3.0 system (Kurtz et al., 2004). As shown inSupplementary Figure 6, genomes of these three ISS strains aligned perfectly, while the closest genomes ofM. indicumandM. plataniexhibited divergence with the ISS type strain IF7SW B2T. Since these three ISS strains were isolated at different time periods and from various locations, their persistence in the ISS environment and ecological significance in the closed systems warrant further study.\n\nGenomic analyses ofMethylobacterium ajmaliiin comparison to other species of the familyMethylobacteriaceae.\n\nThe fourth strain I1 R3 was identified asM. rhodesianumbased on highly similar 16S rRNA (99.9%),gyrB(100%), ANI (98.9%), and dDDH (91.6%) genomic parameters withM. rhodesianumDSM 5687T. The pigmentation of the strain I1 R3 (light pink) was also different from the novel ISSMethylobacteriumstrains (reddish pink). The ANI and dDDH values between I1 R3 and the three novel ISSMethylobacteriumstrains were 82% and 24%, respectively. Hence, genomic and morphological analyses confirmed the phylogenetic affiliation of strain I1 R3 asM. rhodesianum. In this communication, phylogenetic affiliations of only IF7SW B2T, IIF1SW B5, and IIF4SW B5 strains were presented.\n\nThe minimal information about the ISS strain genome characteristics are given inSupplementary Table 2. The differential phenotypic characteristics of IF7SW B2T, IIF1SW B5, and IIF4SW B5 are listed inTable 3, in comparison with other relatedMethylobacteriumspecies. Three strains belonging toMethylobacteriumsp. nov. are reddish pink pigmented, Gram stain negative, catalase positive, oxidase positive, motile, and rod shaped. These strains grew well on nutrient agar and R2A. These three strains grew optimally at temperatures between 25 and 30 degreesC, were viable only at pH 6.0 to 8.0, and exhibited poor tolerance to salt (0 to 1%). Absence of growth was observed when grown at 7, 37, and 45 degreesC. These strains were positive for assimilation ofL arabinose,D glucose, maltose,D mannitol,D mannose, malic acid, potassium gluconate, and trisodium citrate. These strains also exhibited esterase lipase and trypsin enzymatic activities. The complete results of phenotypic characteristics determined using API 20 NE, API ZYM, and API 50 CH are detailed inSupplementary Tables 3 5, respectively. The majority of the phenotypic characteristics of the ISS strains were similar to otherMethylobacteriumspecies. Phenotypically, these three ISS strains were different from the closest genomic relativeM. indicumin assimilating glucose, malic acid, maltose, mannitol, potassium gluconate, and trisodium citrate. Furthermore, unlikeM. indicum, these ISS strains did not exhibit growth at pH 5.0. In comparison to otherMethylobacteriumspecies,M. aquaticumandM. terraeexhibit similar carbon substrate utilization and enzyme production profiles. However, malic acid was assimilated by these ISS strains but not byM. aquaticum. Maltose was also utilized by these ISS strains but not byM. terraecells.\n\nDifferential phenotypic characteristics ofMethylobacterium ajmaliiand related species of genusMethylobacterium.\n\nStrains: 1:Methylobacteriumsp. nov. (n= 3, where n: IF7SW B2T, IIF1SW B5 and IIF4SW B5) (this study); 2:M. currusPR1016AT(Park et al., 2018); 3:M. aquaticumDSM 16371T(Gallego et al., 2005a;Park et al., 2018); 4: M. variable DSM 16961T(Gallego et al., 2005b;Park et al., 2018); 5: M. platani JCM 14648T(Kang et al., 2007;Park et al., 2018); 6: M. tarhaniae DSM 25844T(Veyisoglu et al., 2013;Kim et al., 2019); 7: M. terrae KCTC 52904T(Kim et al., 2019); 8: M. indicum SE2.11T(Chaudhry et al., 2016); 9: M. frigidaeris IER25 16T(Lee and Jeon, 2018). w, weakly positive; +, Positive;  , Negative; N.D., not determined. All strains exhibited 0 1% NaCl tolerance and were motile. *Growth was tested at 7, 25, 30, 37, and 45 degreesC and cells were grown optimally at 25 and 30 degreesC but no growth was observed at 7, 37, and 45 degreesC. Growth lower than 25 degreesC might be possible but not tested.\n\nThe main phenotypic characteristics of the ISS strains IF7SW B2T, IIF1SW B5, and IIF4SW B5 were in accordance with the description of the genusMethylobacterium, with the most important being reddish pink pigmentation (Green and Bousfield, 1982). The optimum growth conditions (temperature, pH, salt tolerance) of the ISSMethylobacteriumstrains were similar to other members belonging to the genusMethylobacterium. Also, these three ISS strains shared the properties of exhibiting catalase activity and motility with otherMethylobacteriumspecies. However, the three novel ISSMethylobacteriumstrains differed from other members of the genusMethylobacteriumin some of the phenotypic characteristics, as shown inTable 3. For instance, they exhibited properties like assimilation of certain sugars, which was absent in some of theMethylobacteriumspecies. They also did not show cystine arylamidase activity as opposed to several relatedMethylobacteriumspecies.\n\nThe FAME profiling of three ISS strains and other relatedMethylobacteriumspecies are given inTable 4. The major fatty acids in these ISS strains were C18:17cand/or C18:16c(Sum in Feature 8; 82 to 85%) with small amounts of C18:03 OH, C16:0, C17:0, Sum in Feature 3, Sum in Feature 2, C18:0and C12:0, and traces of C11:0, C13:0, and C14:0.The fatty acids, C18:17cand/or C18:16c, were observed to be dominant in these ISS strains, similar to other species. However, complete FAME profiles were not consistent amongMethylobacteriumspecies and some significant differences in the proportions of certain fatty acids were observed (Table 4). The notable difference in the FAME profile was the lower abundance of C18:17cinM. indicum(46%) when compared with these ISS strains (82 to 85%).\n\nPercentage of total cellular fatty acids fromMethylobacterium ajmaliiand related species of genusMethylobacterium.\n\nStrains: 1: IF7SW B2T(this study), 2: IIF1SW B5 (this study); 3: IIF4SW B5 (this study); 4:M. currusPR1016AT(Park et al., 2018); 5:M. aquaticumDSM 16371T(Kim et al., 2019); 6: M. variableDSM 16961T(Park et al., 2018); 7:M. plataniJCM 14648T(Kang et al., 2007); 8:M. tarhaniaeDSM 25844T(Kim et al., 2019); 9:M. terraeKCTC 52904T(Kim et al., 2019); 10:M. indicumSE2.11T(Chaudhry et al., 2016); 11:M. frigidaerisIER25 16T(Lee and Jeon, 2018).  : Not detected, tr: trace amount (<1%). *Summed features represent groups of two or three fatty acids that cannot be separated using the MIDI system. Summed feature 2 (iso C16:1 I and/or C14:0 3 OH), summed feature 3 (C16:1 7cand/or C16:1 6c), Sum In Feature 5 comprises of C18:0 6,9c and ante C18:0 and summed feature 8 (C18:1 7cand/or C18:16c).\n\nThese ISS strains contained Q 10 as the major respiratory isoprenoid quinone, which is common in members of the genusMethylobacterium. The polar lipids present in these three strains were diphosphatidylglycerol (DPG), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidyl choline (PC), phosphatidyl ethanolamine (PE), and an unidentified lipid (Supplementary Figure 7). The total polar lipid profile of these ISS strains was consistent with their close relatives, predominated with phospholipids, DPG, PG, and PE. Furthermore, the chemotaxonomic data together with the results of the genomic and phylogenetic analysis support the affiliation of strains IF7SW B2T, IIF1SW B5, and IIF4SW B5 to the genusMethylobacterium.\n\nThe genome of the ISS strain IF7SW B2T, type strain, was annotated and analyzed to determine biotechnologically important genetic determinants. The whole genome and annotation analysis predicted a total of 6,531 genes in the assembled draft genome. Among these, 1,430 fell into various RAST categories, contributing to 2,067 predicted features described inTable 5. All the 1,430 feature and subsystems have been documented inSupplementary Data 1. A major fraction of the annotated genes was composed of amino acids and derivatives (408), carbohydrate metabolism (246), protein metabolism (198), genes associated with cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups, pigments metabolism (190), and respiration (151) (Table 5). Genes responsible for motility and chemotaxis (95), metabolism of aromatic compounds (47), and stress response (72) were also observed.\n\nGenes belonging to different functional categories based on annotation generated using RAST forMethylobacterium ajmaliiIF7SW B2T.\n\n*Total protein coding genes as per annotated genome.\n\nBased on the genome annotation, genes for nitrogen metabolism were predicted in the genome of the ISS strain IF7SW B2T. Most of the subsystem features aligned with the ammonia assimilation pathway (11 genes), which is a preferred nitrogen source for the bacteria (Leigh and Dodsworth, 2007). In addition, metabolic factors similar to high affinity phosphate transporter and control of Pho regulon were also identified in the ISS strain IF7SW B2T(Wanner, 1993,1996). Interestingly, a higher number of stress tolerance genes, especially the oxidative stress response factors, were observed in the ISS strain IF7SW B2Twhen compared with other novel species isolated from the ISS;Methylobacteriumsp. IF7SW B2Texhibited 58 features, whereas 36 features were identified inSolibacillus kalamii(Seuylemezian et al., 2017) and 18 features were identified inKalamiella piersonii(Singh et al., 2019). The results obtained agree with the previous reports that showed altered regulation of the stress response factors in microorganisms, in the presence of microgravity conditions (Orsini et al., 2017;Aunins et al., 2018). Further studies on the role of oxidative stress in species selection are warranted. The WGS assembly of these three ISS strains reported here will enable the comparative genomic characterization of ISS isolates with Earth counterparts in future studies. This will further aid in the identification of genetic determinants that might potentially be responsible for promoting plant growth under microgravity conditions and contribute to the development of self sustainable plant crops for long term space missions in future.\n\nA thorough genomic analysis of the ISS strain IF7SW B2Trevealed the presence of genes that have been involved in promoting plant growth. The isopentenyl tRNA transferase (miaA) essential for cytokinin production reported inM. aquaticumstrain 22A (Tani et al., 2015) was also found in genome of the ISS strain IF7SW B2Twith high similarity. The product of themiaAgene was reported to be responsible for isopentenylation of a specific adenine in some tRNAs and confirmed the secretion of zeatin originated from tRNA inM. extorquens(Koenig et al., 2002). Furthermore, multiple components of the cobalamin synthesis pathway, such as cobalamin biosynthesis protein BluB,L threonine 3 O phosphate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.81), adenosylcobinamide phosphate guanylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.62), cobyric acid synthase (EC 6.3.5.10), nicotinate nucleotide dimethylbenzimidazole phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.21), adenosylcobinamide phosphate synthase (EC 6.3.1.10), cob(I)alamin adenosyltransferase. (EC 2.5.1.17), cobalamin synthase (EC 2.7.8.26), and adenosylcobinamide kinase (EC 2.7.1.156), were identified in genome of the ISS strain IF7SW B2T. The metabolic pathway for cobalamin synthesis predicted in the ISS strain is presented (Supplementary Figure 8). Supporting this prediction, previous study also reported thatMethylobacteriumstrains harbor genes involved in the production of a variety of vitamins, such as cobalamin, biotin, thiamin, and riboflavin, indicating the potential of methylobacteria promoting algal growth (Krug et al., 2020). In addition, genes associated with siderophore production, i.e., ferric siderophore transport system, biopolymer transport protein ExbB, and multiple flagellar proteins, were identified in genome of the ISS strain IF7SW B2Tand are listed in theSupplementary Figure 8. Genes involved in iron acquisition and metabolism in which microalgae benefit from bacterial siderophores have been reported previously inMethylobacteriumspp. (Krug et al., 2020). In the \"carbon for iron mutualism\" concept, algae assimilated iron complexed in bacterial siderophores and in return provided essential dissolved organic matter for the bacteria (Amin et al., 2015). Similar studies are warranted to confirm the plant growth promoting activities in the IF7SW B2TISS strain.\n\nIn summary, the phylogenetic and genetic distinctiveness and differential phenotypic properties were sufficient to categorize these three ISS strains as members of a species distinct from other recognizedMethylobacteriumspecies. Therefore, on the basis of the data presented, strains IF7SW B2T, IIF1SW B5, and IIF4SW B5 represent a novel species of the genusMethylobacterium, for which the nameMethylobacterium ajmaliisp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is IF7SW B2T(NRRL B 65601Tand LMG 32165T).\n\nMethylobacterium ajmalii(aj.ma'li.i. N.L. gen. n.ajmaliinamed after Ajmal Khan, a renowned Indian scientist on biodiversity). Cells are Gram stain negative, aerobic, and motile rods showing oxidase  and catalase positive reactions. Cells are 1.6 1.8 um wide and 2.2 3.2 um long. Colonies on R2A agar are reddish pink pigmented, circular, convex, and smooth, with a diameter of approximately 0.6 1.0 mm after 3 days of incubation on R2A agar. Growth occurs at 25 30 degreesC (optimum, 30 degreesC), at pH 6.0 8.0 (optimum, pH 7.0) and in the presence of 0 1.0% (w/v) NaCl (optimum, 0%). In API ZYM tests, the strain is positive for Alkaline phosphatase, Esterase (C4), Esterase lipase (C8), Leucine arylamidase, Trypsin, Acid phosphatase, and Naphthol AS BI phosphohydrolase, but negative for other enzyme activities. Cells utilize Adipic acid,D glucose,D maltose,D mannitol,D mannose, L arabinose, Malic acid, N acetyl glucosamine, Potassium gluconate, and Trisodium citrate for growth, but not other substrates in API 20NE. Cells are capable of weakly fermenting inulin andD melezitose as observed in API 50 CH. Ubiquinone Q 10 is the predominant respiratory isoprenoid quinone. The major fatty acid is summed feature 8 (comprising C18:1 7cand/or C18:1 6c). The major polar lipids are diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylglycerol. The genomic DNA G + C content of the type strain is 71.07 mol%.\n\nThe type strain IF7SW B2Tis isolated from the International Space Station.",
    "discussion": "This study reports the isolation and identification of four strains belonging to the family Methylobacteriaceae , collected from different locations on the ISS. Three of the strains, referred to as IF7SW B2 T , IIF1SW B5, and IIF4SW B5, were identified based on the traditional and genomic taxonomic approaches. The fourth strain, which was isolated from a HEPA filter and referred to as I1 R3, was identified based on genomic analyses only.\n\nPhylogenetic Analysis of Novel ISS Strains To confirm that three of the ISS strains (IF7SW B2 T , IIF1SW B5, and IIF4SW B5) belong to a novel species, their phylogenetic affiliations were analyzed with other species belonging to the genus Methylobacterium . The sequence similarity of these three ISS strains with validly described Methylobacterium species was <99.4% for 16S rRNA gene ( Supplementary Table 1 ) and <97.3% for gyrB gene with the closest being M. indicum SE2.11 T . Phylogenetic analysis of these three ISS strains was carried out by constructing a maximum likelihood tree based on 16S rRNA ( Figure 1 ), gyrB ( Figure 2 ), atpD ( Supplementary Figure 1 ), recA ( Supplementary Figure 2 ), dnaK ( Supplementary Figure 3 ), rpoB ( Supplementary Figure 4 ), and glnI ( Supplementary Figure 5 ) gene sequences. In addition, MLSA was carried out by concatenating the six housekeeping genes manually ( Figure 3 ). In addition, a phylogenetic tree based on WGS was generated ( Figure 4 ). The phylogenetic trees constructed based on all these genes, MLSA, and WGS showed that these three ISS strains (IF7SW B2 T , IIF1SW B5, and IIF4SW B5) are clustered together and in the same clade with M. indicum SE2.11 T . The 16S rRNA gene sequencing, housekeeping gene based analyses, MLSA, and genome based tree further supported the concept that these three ISS strains belong to the same species but are closely related to M. indicum . In addition, the identity of the ISS strain I1 R3 was further confirmed to be M. rhodesianum based on its 16S rRNA gene ( Figure 1 ) and gyrB ( Figure 2 ) phylogenetic affiliation to the type strain M. rhodesianum DSM 5687 T .

The results are summarized in Table 1 . The genome varied in size from 6.1 to 6.8 Mbp with GC content between 68 and 71%, similar to other members of the family Methylobacteriaceae . TABLE 1.

The ANI indices of three ISS strains (IF7SW B2 T , IIF1SW B5, and IIF4SW B5) with M. indicum SE2.11 T were 92.7 to 93%, and dDDH values were 45.8 to 46.4%. The ANI and dDDH values obtained for three ISS strains with other Methylobacterium species were below the threshold of 95% ANI ( Yoon et al., 2017 ) and 70% dDDH values ( Auch et al., 2010 ), which were established for prokaryotic species delineation. This suggested that these three ISS strains are novel species of the genus Methylobacterium . These three ISS strains exhibited ANI and dDDH values around 99 100% with each other, indicating that they belong to the same species. The entire genomes of these three ISS strains, M. indicum SE2.11 T , and M. platani PMB02 T were aligned to detect their divergence and similarity using the MUMmer 3.0 system ( Kurtz et al., 2004 ). As shown in Supplementary Figure 6 , genomes of these three ISS strains aligned perfectly, while the closest genomes of M. indicum and M. platani exhibited divergence with the ISS type strain IF7SW B2 T . Since these three ISS strains were isolated at different time periods and from various locations, their persistence in the ISS environment and ecological significance in the closed systems warrant further study.

The pigmentation of the strain I1 R3 (light pink) was also different from the novel ISS Methylobacterium strains (reddish pink). The ANI and dDDH values between I1 R3 and the three novel ISS Methylobacterium strains were 82% and 24%, respectively. Hence, genomic and morphological analyses confirmed the phylogenetic affiliation of strain I1 R3 as M. rhodesianum . In this communication, phylogenetic affiliations of only IF7SW B2 T , IIF1SW B5, and IIF4SW B5 strains were presented.\n\nPhenotypic Characterization of Novel ISS Strains The minimal information about the ISS strain genome characteristics are given in Supplementary Table 2 . The differential phenotypic characteristics of IF7SW B2 T , IIF1SW B5, and IIF4SW B5 are listed in Table 3 , in comparison with other related Methylobacterium species. Three strains belonging to Methylobacterium sp. nov. are reddish pink pigmented, Gram stain negative, catalase positive, oxidase positive, motile, and rod shaped. These strains grew well on nutrient agar and R2A. These three strains grew optimally at temperatures between 25 and 30 degreesC, were viable only at pH 6.0 to 8.0, and exhibited poor tolerance to salt (0 to 1%). Absence of growth was observed when grown at 7, 37, and 45 degreesC. These strains were positive for assimilation of L  arabinose, D  glucose, maltose, D  mannitol, D  mannose, malic acid, potassium gluconate, and trisodium citrate. These strains also exhibited esterase lipase and trypsin enzymatic activities. The complete results of phenotypic characteristics determined using API 20 NE, API ZYM, and API 50 CH are detailed in Supplementary Tables 3 5 , respectively. The majority of the phenotypic characteristics of the ISS strains were similar to other Methylobacterium species. Phenotypically, these three ISS strains were different from the closest genomic relative M. indicum in assimilating glucose, malic acid, maltose, mannitol, potassium gluconate, and trisodium citrate. Furthermore, unlike M. indicum , these ISS strains did not exhibit growth at pH 5.0. In comparison to other Methylobacterium species, M. aquaticum and M. terrae exhibit similar carbon substrate utilization and enzyme production profiles. However, malic acid was assimilated by these ISS strains but not by M. aquaticum . Maltose was also utilized by these ISS strains but not by M. terrae cells. TABLE 3.

All strains exhibited 0 1% NaCl tolerance and were motile. *Growth was tested at 7, 25, 30, 37, and 45 degreesC and cells were grown optimally at 25 and 30 degreesC but no growth was observed at 7, 37, and 45 degreesC. Growth lower than 25 degreesC might be possible but not tested. The main phenotypic characteristics of the ISS strains IF7SW B2 T , IIF1SW B5, and IIF4SW B5 were in accordance with the description of the genus Methylobacterium , with the most important being reddish pink pigmentation ( Green and Bousfield, 1982 ). The optimum growth conditions (temperature, pH, salt tolerance) of the ISS Methylobacterium strains were similar to other members belonging to the genus Methylobacterium . Also, these three ISS strains shared the properties of exhibiting catalase activity and motility with other Methylobacterium species. However, the three novel ISS Methylobacterium strains differed from other members of the genus Methylobacterium in some of the phenotypic characteristics, as shown in Table 3 . For instance, they exhibited properties like assimilation of certain sugars, which was absent in some of the Methylobacterium species. They also did not show cystine arylamidase activity as opposed to several related Methylobacterium species.\n\nChemotaxonomic Characterization of Novel ISS Strains The FAME profiling of three ISS strains and other related Methylobacterium species are given in Table 4 . The major fatty acids in these ISS strains were C 18 : 1 7 c and/or C 18 : 1 6 c (Sum in Feature 8; 82 to 85%) with small amounts of C 18 : 0 3 OH, C 16 : 0 , C 17 : 0 , Sum in Feature 3, Sum in Feature 2, C 18 : 0 and C 12 : 0 , and traces of C 11 : 0 , C 13 : 0 , and C 14 : 0 . The fatty acids, C 18 : 1 7 c and/or C 18 : 1 6 c , were observed to be dominant in these ISS strains, similar to other species. However, complete FAME profiles were not consistent among Methylobacterium species and some significant differences in the proportions of certain fatty acids were observed ( Table 4 ). The notable difference in the FAME profile was the lower abundance of C 18 : 1 7 c in M. indicum (46%) when compared with these ISS strains (82 to 85%). TABLE 4.

Summed feature 2 (iso C16:1 I and/or C14:0 3 OH), summed feature 3 (C16:1 7 c and/or C16:1 6 c ), Sum In Feature 5 comprises of C18:0 6,9c and ante C18:0 and summed feature 8 (C18:1 7 c and/or C18:16 c ). These ISS strains contained Q 10 as the major respiratory isoprenoid quinone, which is common in members of the genus Methylobacterium . The polar lipids present in these three strains were diphosphatidylglycerol (DPG), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidyl choline (PC), phosphatidyl ethanolamine (PE), and an unidentified lipid ( Supplementary Figure 7 ). The total polar lipid profile of these ISS strains was consistent with their close relatives, predominated with phospholipids, DPG, PG, and PE. Furthermore, the chemotaxonomic data together with the results of the genomic and phylogenetic analysis support the affiliation of strains IF7SW B2 T , IIF1SW B5, and IIF4SW B5 to the genus Methylobacterium .\n\nFunctional Characteristics of the Novel ISS Strain The genome of the ISS strain IF7SW B2 T , type strain, was annotated and analyzed to determine biotechnologically important genetic determinants. The whole genome and annotation analysis predicted a total of 6,531 genes in the assembled draft genome. Among these, 1,430 fell into various RAST categories, contributing to 2,067 predicted features described in Table 5 . All the 1,430 feature and subsystems have been documented in Supplementary Data 1 . A major fraction of the annotated genes was composed of amino acids and derivatives (408), carbohydrate metabolism (246), protein metabolism (198), genes associated with cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups, pigments metabolism (190), and respiration (151) ( Table 5 ). Genes responsible for motility and chemotaxis (95), metabolism of aromatic compounds (47), and stress response (72) were also observed. TABLE 5.

Based on the genome annotation, genes for nitrogen metabolism were predicted in the genome of the ISS strain IF7SW B2 T . Most of the subsystem features aligned with the ammonia assimilation pathway (11 genes), which is a preferred nitrogen source for the bacteria ( Leigh and Dodsworth, 2007 ). In addition, metabolic factors similar to high affinity phosphate transporter and control of Pho regulon were also identified in the ISS strain IF7SW B2 T ( Wanner, 1993 , 1996 ). Interestingly, a higher number of stress tolerance genes, especially the oxidative stress response factors, were observed in the ISS strain IF7SW B2 T when compared with other novel species isolated from the ISS; Methylobacterium sp. IF7SW B2 T exhibited 58 features, whereas 36 features were identified in Solibacillus kalamii ( Seuylemezian et al., 2017 ) and 18 features were identified in Kalamiella piersonii ( Singh et al., 2019 ). The results obtained agree with the previous reports that showed altered regulation of the stress response factors in microorganisms, in the presence of microgravity conditions ( Orsini et al., 2017 ; Aunins et al., 2018 ). Further studies on the role of oxidative stress in species selection are warranted. The WGS assembly of these three ISS strains reported here will enable the comparative genomic characterization of ISS isolates with Earth counterparts in future studies. This will further aid in the identification of genetic determinants that might potentially be responsible for promoting plant growth under microgravity conditions and contribute to the development of self sustainable plant crops for long term space missions in future.\n\nGenes Essential for Interaction With Plants in the ISS Strain A thorough genomic analysis of the ISS strain IF7SW B2 T revealed the presence of genes that have been involved in promoting plant growth. The isopentenyl tRNA transferase ( miaA ) essential for cytokinin production reported in M. aquaticum strain 22A ( Tani et al., 2015 ) was also found in genome of the ISS strain IF7SW B2 T with high similarity. The product of the miaA gene was reported to be responsible for isopentenylation of a specific adenine in some tRNAs and confirmed the secretion of zeatin originated from tRNA in M. extorquens ( Koenig et al., 2002 ). Furthermore, multiple components of the cobalamin synthesis pathway, such as cobalamin biosynthesis protein BluB, L  threonine 3 O phosphate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.81), adenosylcobinamide phosphate guanylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.62), cobyric acid synthase (EC 6.3.5.10), nicotinate nucleotide dimethylbenzimidazole phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.21), adenosylcobinamide phosphate synthase (EC 6.3.1.10), cob(I)alamin adenosyltransferase. (EC 2.5.1.17), cobalamin synthase (EC 2.7.8.26), and adenosylcobinamide kinase (EC 2.7.1.156), were identified in genome of the ISS strain IF7SW B2 T . The metabolic pathway for cobalamin synthesis predicted in the ISS strain is presented ( Supplementary Figure 8 ). Supporting this prediction, previous study also reported that Methylobacterium strains harbor genes involved in the production of a variety of vitamins, such as cobalamin, biotin, thiamin, and riboflavin, indicating the potential of methylobacteria promoting algal growth ( Krug et al., 2020 ). In addition, genes associated with siderophore production, i.e., ferric siderophore transport system, biopolymer transport protein ExbB, and multiple flagellar proteins, were identified in genome of the ISS strain IF7SW B2 T and are listed in the Supplementary Figure 8 . Genes involved in iron acquisition and metabolism in which microalgae benefit from bacterial siderophores have been reported previously in Methylobacterium spp. ( Krug et al., 2020 ). In the \"carbon for iron mutualism\" concept, algae assimilated iron complexed in bacterial siderophores and in return provided essential dissolved organic matter for the bacteria ( Amin et al., 2015 ). Similar studies are warranted to confirm the plant growth promoting activities in the IF7SW B2 T ISS strain. In summary, the phylogenetic and genetic distinctiveness and differential phenotypic properties were sufficient to categorize these three ISS strains as members of a species distinct from other recognized Methylobacterium species. Therefore, on the basis of the data presented, strains IF7SW B2 T , IIF1SW B5, and IIF4SW B5 represent a novel species of the genus Methylobacterium , for which the name Methylobacterium ajmalii sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is IF7SW B2 T (NRRL B 65601 T and LMG 32165 T ).\n\nDescription of Methylobacterium ajmalii sp. nov. Methylobacterium ajmalii (aj.ma'li.i. N.L. gen. n. ajmalii named after Ajmal Khan, a renowned Indian scientist on biodiversity). Cells are Gram stain negative, aerobic, and motile rods showing oxidase  and catalase positive reactions. Cells are 1.6 1.8 um wide and 2.2 3.2 um long. Colonies on R2A agar are reddish pink pigmented, circular, convex, and smooth, with a diameter of approximately 0.6 1.0 mm after 3 days of incubation on R2A agar.

In API ZYM tests, the strain is positive for Alkaline phosphatase, Esterase (C4), Esterase lipase (C8), Leucine arylamidase, Trypsin, Acid phosphatase, and Naphthol AS BI phosphohydrolase, but negative for other enzyme activities. Cells utilize Adipic acid, D  glucose, D  maltose, D  mannitol, D  mannose, L arabinose, Malic acid, N acetyl glucosamine, Potassium gluconate, and Trisodium citrate for growth, but not other substrates in API 20NE. Cells are capable of weakly fermenting inulin and D  melezitose as observed in API 50 CH. Ubiquinone Q 10 is the predominant respiratory isoprenoid quinone. The major fatty acid is summed feature 8 (comprising C18:1 7 c and/or C18:1 6 c ). The major polar lipids are diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylglycerol. The genomic DNA G + C content of the type strain is 71.07 mol%. The type strain IF7SW B2 T is isolated from the International Space Station.",
