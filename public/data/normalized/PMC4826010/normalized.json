    "methods": "AnArabidopsis thalianaactivation tagged T DNA seed stock (CS31100) from the ABRC was sterilized in 95% ethanol and 20% bleach according toDyachok et al. (2009). Sterilized seeds were suspended in an autoclaved solution of 0.5x Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 1% sucrose (pH 5.7), 100 nMLatB(Calbiochem EMD Chemicals), and 0.5% agar (Sigma Aldrich) after the solution had cooled to 55 degreesC. The seed suspension was gently swirled in a 500 mL Erlenmeyer flask to disperse the seeds uniformly and poured into 10 x 10 cm square Petri plates before the agar solidified. Petri dishes were left at 4 degreesC for 2 d and transferred to a growth chamber with 120 umol m 2s 1light intensity supplied with fluorescent bulbs and set to a 14 h light and 10 h dark cycle. Temperature in the chamber was maintained at 23 degreesC while keeping plates in a vertical position. After 5 to 6 d, seedlings with severely inhibited primary root growth were selected. Primary root growth of the progeny of selected seedlings was compared with the wild type on a range ofLatBconcentrations.\n\nHomozygoushlb1(Col 0 ecotype) was crossed to the Landsbergerectaecotype, and F2 seedlings were selected based on their enhanced sensitivity to 50 nMLatB. Simple sequence length polymorphism and cleavage of amplified polymorphic site markers were used to maphlb1to a 60 kb region on the lower arm of chromosome 5 (Lukowitz et al., 2000). DNA was extracted from root tissue of 2 week oldhlb1seedlings by grinding in liquid nitrogen with a mortar and pestle followed by mixing with an equal volume of Plant DNAzol Reagent (Invitrogen) and chloroform. After precipitation with ethanol, DNA was washed multiple times and then dissolved in 50 uL water. Full length genomic DNA of various genes in the 60 kb region was sequenced and compared with the Arabidopsis reference genome (TAIR10) until the 2 bp deletion was found inAT5G41950.\n\nThree SALK lines with predicted insertions inAT5G41950(SALK_046760, SALK_144501, and SALK_065836) were obtained from ABRC and genotyped to ensure homozygosity using the following primers: SALK_046760LP (5 TTGCTGGAGGAAGCTTGTAAG 3), SALK_046760RP (5 TGGCTGTATAACTCACCAGGG 3), SALK_065836LP (5 TTCCCTCTCGCATAAATTGTG 3), SALK_065836RP (5 TCAGGTTGCAATTTGATTTCC 3), and LBb1.3 (5 ATTTTGCCGATTTCGGAAC 3). The primer pair used for SALK_144501 was the same as SALK_046760.\n\nOne SALK line (SALK_013761) with a predicted exon insertion inAT3G43300(MIN7/BEN1) was obtained from ABRC. Homozygousben1mutants were isolated using the following primers: SALK_013761LP (5 TGGAAAGTGAAATTGGTGAGC 3), SALK_013761RP (5 CAAGGATTCTTCTCTGCATGG 3), and LBb1.3.\n\nWorking solutions ofLatB(Calbiochem),BFA(Sigma Aldrich), cytochalasin B and D (MP Biomedicals), indole 3 acetic acid, and 1 naphthaleneacetic acid (Sigma Aldrich) were diluted from stock solutions in DMSO. Working solutions of sodium chloride and mannitol (Sigma Aldrich) were prepared directly from solids from the manufacturer's containers. Seedling growth assays were conducted by transplanting 3  to 4 d old seedlings grown on solid (1% agar) ontoMSmedium supplemented with the various chemicals. Seedlings were grown vertically for an additional 4 to 7 d after transplanting in a 14 h light (120 umol m 2s 1) and 10 h dark cycle or in complete darkness in a growth chamber set to 23 degreesC. In another set of experiments, 4 d old seedlings with straight primary roots were transplanted on new Petri plates withMSmedium. After 1 h of vertical growth, plates were reoriented by 90 degrees and primary roots were photographed every hour for 12 h. Images of seedlings were captured using a DXM1200C digital camera (Nikon) mounted on a copy stand or an SZX12 stereomicroscope (Olympus). Hypocotyl, primary root and root hair lengths, and root curvature were measured using the Image J v1.49 software (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/).\n\nThe 3  to 4 d old wild type (Col 0 ecotype) andhlb1seedlings expressingPIN2 GFPorHLB1 GFPwere incubated onBFAorLatBdiluted withMSmedium on welled plates for various time periods and mounted on glass slides prior to imaging with a Leica TCS AOBS confocal scanning laser microscope (Leica Microsystems). For endocytic assays, a working solution of 4 uM FM1 43 (Invitrogen) was prepared inMSmedium from a 10 mM aqueous solution. After incubating for 30 min in liquidMSmedium, 3  to 4 d old seedlings were pulse labeled with FM1 43 for 5 min at room temperature. Seedlings were then treated with 50 uMBFAfor 1 h prior to confocal imaging. In a separate set of seedlings expressing PIN2 GFP or pulse labeled with FM1 43,BFAwas washed out by transferring seedlings to liquidMSmedium prior to imaging.\n\nTheHLB1pro:HLB1 GFPconstruct was generated from full lengthHLB1gDNA extracted from roots of 2 week old wild type Arabidopsis seedlings using the Plant DNAzol Reagent (Invitrogen). Full lengthHLB1gDNA including 400 bp immediately preceding the start codon (3319 bp total) was amplified using the following primers: HLBpro F XmaI (5 CATCCCGGGGACTACTTATATCTTTCACTCTTGTTC 3) and HLBpro R XmaI (5 TACCCCGGGCACCGGTGATAATACCGGCTA 3). The product was cloned into a modified pCAMBIA1390 vector as described (Wang et al., 2008).\n\n35Spro:GFP HLB1was generated from full lengthHLB1cDNA (1698 bp) amplified using the following primers: HLB F NcoI (5 CATCCATGGTAATGGCGGATACTGTTGAAGAG 3) and HLB R SpeI (5  CATACTAGTTTAACCGGTGATAATACCGGC 3). The resulting product was digested withNcoI andSpeI (New England Biolabs) and cloned into a modified pCAMBIA1390 vector behind the CaMV 35S promoter driving expression of GFP (Wang et al., 2008). To generate the GFP HLB1CTDfusion, a truncatedHLB1cDNA fragment, from position 1 to 1482 bp, was amplified using the primers HLB1 F NcoI and HLB1CTD R SpeI (5 TACACTAGTTTATACCGTCTTCCTCTCCACGT 3), and the resulting product was digested withNcoI andSpeI (New England Biolabs) and cloned into a modified pCAMBIA1390 vector. Similarly, the GFP HLB1TPRfusion was created by first amplifyingHLB1cDNA from position 1 to 609 bp with the following primers: HLB1TPR F NcoI (5 CATCCATGGTAATGGCGGATACTGTTGAAGAG 3) and HLB1TPR R SpeI (5 TACACTAGTACGTTGGCGAGATCGACC 3). This fragment was digested withNcoI andSpeI (New England Biolabs) and cloned into a modified pCAMBIA1390 vector to created HLB11 609. Next, anHLB1cDNA fragment was amplified from position 1276 to 1698 bp with the following primers: HLB1TPR(2) F SpeI (5 CATACTAGTCTACCTCTCCCGCATCTTAAAGT 3) and HLB1TPR(2) R PmlI (5 TACCACGTGTTAACCGGTGATAATACCGGC 3). This fragment was digested withSpeI andPmlI (New England Biolabs) and cloned into the HLB11 609construct. The35Spro:OsHLB1 GFPconstruct was generated by amplifying full lengthOsHLB1cDNA (1449 bp) with the primers OsHLB1 F SalI (5 CATGTCGACATGGAGGATTCTGCGCGG 3) and OsHLB1 R EcoRI (5 GTAGAATTCACCAGTAATGATACCTGCCAATACA 3). The product was digested withSalI andEcoRI (New England Biolabs) and again cloned into a modified pCAMBIA1390 vector. Constructs were introduced intohlb1 1viaAgrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation using the floral dip method (Clough and Bent, 1998).\n\nhlb1 1seedlings expressing HLB1pro:HLB1 GFP were crossed with various red  or cyan emitting marker lines. The PIN2 GFP, Man49 mCherry, SYP61 CFP, mCherry VTI12, mCherry RabA1g, mCherry Ara6, GFP ABD2 GFP, mCherry ABD2 mCherry, MIN7/BEN1 GFP, RFP AFVY, and SEC RFP lines were described previously (Nelson et al., 2007;Robert et al., 2008;Geldner et al., 2009;Nomura et al., 2011;Feraru et al., 2012;Renna et al., 2013;Dyachok et al., 2014). To generate the UBQ10pro:Lifeact mEGFP construct, mEGFP with the 51 bp Lifeact sequence directly upstream was amplified from plasmid DNA described byVidali et al. (2009)using the following primers: Lifeact F EcoRI (5 CATGAATTCATGGGTGTCGCAGATTTGATC 3) and Lifeact R SpeI (5 TACACTAGTTTACTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGC 3). The resulting product was digested withEcoRI andSpeI (New England Biolabs) and cloned behind the UBQ10 promoter in a modified pCAMBIA1390 vector. Five day old seedlings coexpressing HLB1 GFP and various red  or cyan emitting markers were imaged with a Leica confocal microscope or Perkin Elmer UltraView ERS spinning disc confocal microscope.\n\nFor quantification of F actin andTGN/EEdynamics, images of epidermal cells in the root maturation zone or root hairs growing along the bottom of 48 x 64 mm cover slips coated withMSmedium in 0.5% agar were captured every 0.5 to 1 s for 1 to 3 min with a Perkin Elmer spinning disc confocal microscope equipped with a Zeiss C Apochromat 63x water or a 100x oil immersion objective.\n\nPercentage of occupancy of F actin was determined using the algorithm described byHigaki et al. (2010). Prior to applying the Higaki algorithm, single cells from the root elongation zone were converted into binary images and filaments skeletonized by software that was developed using MATLAB R2013a (The Mathworks Inc.) as described (Dyachok et al., 2014). Intensity ofBFAagglomerates was obtained using custom software written in MATLAB 8.5. The original images from the confocal microscope were first converted to gray scale and separated into 48 layers by intensity values from zero to maximum (255*255), and a binary image was created. The circle Hough Transform method was used to trace areas occupied byBFA  andLatB induced PIN2 GFP or FM1 43 agglomerates in the binary images. The average intensity in grayscale images in each of marked agglomerate was calculated. From the same set of images used to calculate agglomerate fluorescence intensity, the number of agglomerates per cell was manually counted.\n\nQuantification and statistical analyses of global F actin and YFP VTI12 dynamics were conducted following the methods ofVidali et al. (2010)andDyachok et al. (2014)using images of root epidermal cells and root hairs from at least 15 time lapse movie sequences. To adopt the method used for global analysis of F actin to dynamics of YFP VTI12 foci in root hairs, we first created an algorithm that utilized the Hough Transform method to detect individual organelles from binary images obtained from time lapse movies. This algorithm allowed us to set a threshold so that fluorescence originating from the cytoplasm was excluded from our analysis.\n\nTo quantify fluorescence in thePMand cell interior of PIN2 GFP expressing root cells, we created another algorithm. After converting images to gray scale, binary images were generated after separating the image into 48 layers and classifying the layers based on their intensity values. This allowed us to separate fluorescence of thePMfrom the cell interior where the white area in the binary image corresponded toPMsignals and the black area corresponded to the cell interior. Fluorescence intensity was calculated by accumulating the intensity value of each pixel from thePMand cell interior.\n\nTo quantify the extent of colocalization between HLB1 GFP and other mCherry taggedTGN/EEmarkers, spinning disc confocal images were first thresholded using the Volocity quantitation software (Perkin Elmer). The colocalization function of Volocity allows automated thresholding and statistical analyses of red and green channels according to the methods ofManders et al. (1993)andCostes et al. (2004). From the colocalization menu of Volocity quantitation, a region of interest representing a single cell (Figure 7A) was selected, and from generated scatterplots (Figure 7F) (Bottanelli et al., 2012), Pearson's correlation coefficient values were calculated.\n\nTo deduce phylogeny of HLB1, sequences for 141 homologous proteins from 79 species were obtained from GenBank. The amino acid sequences were aligned by MUSCLE algorithm (Edgar, 2004), and unreliable sequences with confidence score lower than 0.6 were removed (Penn et al., 2010). The alignment is available asSupplemental Data Set 3. Subsequent phylogenetic analyses were conducted in MEGA6 (Tamura et al., 2013) based on the maximum likelihood method (Le and Gascuel, 2008). A matrix of pairwise distances was estimated by the JTT model, and the tree with the highest log likelihood (12,977) was chosen with the Neighbor join and BIONJ algorithm. A discrete gamma distribution was used to model evolutionary rate differences among sites (+G, parameter = 3.2081). All positions with <95% site coverage were eliminated.\n\nTo findTPR containing proteins, the Arabidopsis genome was scanned with TPRpred (Karpenahalli et al., 2007). The resulting 587 proteins were compared against the Conserved Domain Database (Marchler Bauer et al., 2015). The 147 Arabidopsis proteins were identified to have more than oneTPRmotifs. Predicated subcellular localization for theTPRproteins was obtained from the SubCellular Proteome Database and presented inSupplemental Data Set 1.\n\nCo IP experiments were conducted using the Pierce Classic IP kit (Thermo Scientific). Briefly, proteins were extracted by grinding roots of 2 week old Arabidopsis seedlings expressing35Spro:GFP,35Spro:GFP HLB, and35Spro:MIN7/BEN1 GFPin liquid nitrogen. The fine powder was then mixed with extraction/wash solution supplemented with 1:100 protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma Aldrich) by vortexing. The protein extracts were centrifuged at 16,000gfor 10 min at 4 degreesC. The supernatant was mixed with control resin via end over end shaking in a 15 mL Falcon tube for 1 h at 4 degreesC. The mixture was then added to a spin column and centrifuged at 1000gfor 30 s at 4 degreesC. Rabbit Anti GFP Monoclonal Antibody (ABCAM catalog number1218, lot number GR181836 3) was added to the cleared protein lysate and mixed by end over end shaking overnight at 4 degreesC. Protein A/G plus agarose resin was then added and allowed to mix for 1 h at 4 degreesC. The mixture was again added to a spin column and centrifuged at 1000gfor 30 s at 4 degreesC. The columns were washed five times with extraction/wash solution and then one time with 1x conditioning buffer. The proteins were eluted by adding 2x nonreducing lane marker sample buffer with 20 mM DTT and heating for 10 min at 100 degreesC. Once cooled, the columns were placed inside Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged at 1000gfor 30 s at 4 degreesC. Composition of the eluent was analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry (Bioproximity). Briefly, the samples were digested with trypsin (10 ug/mL) overnight at 37 degreesC. The resulting peptides were dried and redissolved in 50% acetonitrile with 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid. The peptides were resolved with Thermo Easy nLC1000 column (C18 reverse phase, 50 cm,  75 um), ionized with Thermo Easy Spray, and then analyzed with a Thermo Q exactive quadrupole Orbitrap mass spectrometer. The spectra were assigned to peptides using the OMSSA (Geer et al., 2004), X!Tandem (Craig and Beavis, 2004), and X!Hunter (Craig et al., 2006) algorithms.\n\nSequence data from this article can be found in the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative or GenBank/ EMBL databases under the following accession numbers: HLB1 (AT5G41950) and MIN7/BEN1 (AT3G43300).

    "results": "Approximately 20,000 T DNA activation tagged seedlings in the Col 0 background were grown on media supplemented with 100 nMLatB. Seedlings with significantly reduced primary root length were isolated and their progeny were retested for increasedLatBsensitivity. Three nonallelic mutants whose primary roots were hypersensitive toLatBwere identified andhlb1was selected for further study (Figures 1Ato1D). Hypocotyls ofhlb1grown in the dark and root hairs of light grown seedlings were also hypersensitive toLatB(Supplemental Figure 1). Moreover,hlb1primary roots displayed increased sensitivity to cytochalasins, another class of actin disrupting compounds (Supplemental Figure 2). Analysis of 224 F2 seedlings revealed a 172:52 segregation of wild type:mutant for a 3:1 ratio (calculated 2= 0.381 < 20.95= 3.841), indicating thathlb1is recessive in a single Mendelian locus. Homozygoushlb1plants were backcrossed at least three times with Col 0 to reduce the frequency of extraneous mutations.\n\nPrimary Root Growth ofhlb1Is Hypersensitive toLatB.\n\n(A)to(C)Seedlings of the wild type (Col 0 ecotype) andhlb12 d ([A]and[B]) and 6 d(C)after transplanting 3 d old seedlings to growth media supplemented with the solvent control solution(A)or 50 nMLatB([B]and[C]).

Bars = 5 mm.\n\n(D)Dose response analyses of primary root growth (expressed as percent of control) of the wild type andhlb17 d after transplanting 4 d old seedlings to different concentrations ofLatB. Statistical significance was determined by one way ANOVA. Means (n= 45 to 60 roots) +/ se. Different letters are significantly different (P < 0.05, Tukey's test).\n\nOsmotic stress, salt stress, and the auxins indole 3 acetic acid and 1 naphthaleneacetic acid inhibited primary root growth inhlb1to a similar extent as in the wild type, indicating thathlb1is hypersensitive only toLatBand cytochalasin, compounds that directly interfere with actin polymerization (Supplemental Figure 3). The response of other mutants to genes encoding actin regulatory proteins including single mutantsbrk1,arp2,adf4,cpa1,cpb1, andcpb3and quadruple mutantscar1234(Mathur et al., 2003;Dyachok et al., 2011;Li et al., 2012,2015;Henty Ridilla et al., 2014) toLatBwas also compared withhlb1. These mutants exhibited wild type sensitivity toLatB.act8, a mutant of a root expressed vegetative actin isoform, also showed wild type sensitivity toLatB. Althoughact2, a mutant of another root expressed vegetative actin isoform (Kandasamy et al., 2009), was hypersensitive toLatB, its heightened sensitivity to the chemical was not as severe as that ofhlb1(Supplemental Figure 4).\n\nWe asked whether the increased sensitivity ofhlb1roots toLatBcould be explained by inhibition of cell division, cell expansion, or both. To address this question, cortical cell length in the root elongation zone and cortical cell number in the meristem was obtained from confocal microscopy analyses of propidium iodide stained roots 2 d after transplanting seedlings on media with or without 50 nMLatB(Supplemental Figure 5A). Both cortical cell number in the root meristem and cortical cell length in the elongation zone were reduced inLatB treatedhlb1seedlings compared with the wild type, indicating that inhibition of both processes contributed to the hypersensitivity of the mutant to the drug (Supplemental Figures 5B to 5E).\n\nWe next analyzed F actin organization in cells of the elongation zone of wild type andhlb1seedlings expressing the live cell F actin reporterUBQ10pro:GFP ABD2 GFP(Dyachok et al., 2014) transplanted to growth media with or without 50 nMLatB. Cells in the root elongation zone of both genotypes on control medium showed dense and random F actin arrays, a feature typical of cells within this region (Figure 2A). When transplanted onLatB, wild type cells maintained their dense network of F actin that roughly mirrored the controls with the exception of a few fluorescent aggregates. By contrast, cells in the root elongation zone ofLatB treatedhlb1had mostly diffuse fluorescence, fewer distinct F actin arrays, and more numerous fluorescent aggregates compared with the wild type (Figure 2A). To quantify the effect ofLatBon F actin integrity, filament density (occupancy) in cells from the elongation zone was measured using an algorithm developed earlier (Higaki et al., 2010). Whereas the wild type andhlb1on the control medium and wild type onLatB supplemented medium had similar occupancy values,LatB treatedhlb1had significantly lower F actin occupancy values, indicating that F actin structures ofhlb1were indeed more sensitive to the chemical (Figure 2B).\n\nF Actin ofhlb1Roots Is More Sensitive toLatB.\n\n(A)Representative images of F actin organization in the elongation zone of the wild type andhlb1expressingUBQ10pro:GFP ABD2 GFP2 d after transplanting 3 d old seedlings on media supplemented with the solvent control solution or 50 nMLatB.

Means (n> 50 cells) +/ se. Different letters are significantly different (P < 0.05, Tukey's test).\n\nClose examination ofhlb1seedlings revealed that they had mild growth defects even whenLatBwas excluded from the growth medium. Primary roots ofhlb1were slightly shorter than the wild type at 3, 5, and 7 d after planting (Figures 3Aand3B).hlb1root hairs were also shorter than those of the wild type (Figures 3Cto3E). Furthermore, differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy showed thathlb1root hairs were wider and had subtle shape distortions when compared with wild type root hairs (Figure 3F).\n\nPrimary Roots and Root Hairs ofhlb1Are Shorter Than the Wild Type in the Absence ofLatB.\n\n(A)Seven day old wild type andhlb1seedlings grown vertically onLatB free growth medium.

Bar = 20 um.\n\nAs noted, distinct qualitative and quantitative differences in F actin organization in cells of the root elongation zone were observed between wild type andhlb1seedlings but only when treated with 50 nMLatB(Figure 2). We therefore evaluated F actin dynamics in root hairs, where growth differences between the wild type andhlb1appeared to be more pronounced (Figures 3Cto3F). In wild type seedlings, the majority of the actively elongating root hairs were characterized by a distinct enrichment of fine and dynamic meshwork of F actin at the extreme apex (Figure 4A;Supplemental Movie 1). Inhlb1root hairs, the tip focused fine meshwork of F actin was not always observed, and in cases where it was present, it would often dissipate rapidly (Figure 4A;Supplemental Movie 1). Similar results were obtained with wild type andhlb1root hairs expressing the F actin markerUBQ10pro:Lifeact mGFP, which was previously reported to clearly label apical F actin meshwork at the apex of pollen tubes and moss protonema (Vidali et al., 2009). Using a 100x oil immersion objective on the spinning disc confocal microscope, wild type root hairs expressingUBQ10pro:Lifeact mGFPhad distinct filamentous meshwork at the tip that would often dissipate in the tips ofhlb1root hairs (Figure 4B;Supplemental Movie 2). F actin tip dynamics in the wild type andhlb1were quantified from 3 min time lapse movies of growing roots hairs by obtaining the ratio of the total time where the apical meshwork of F actin was clearly visible to the total time elapsed (Figure 4B). This ratio provided an indication of the percentage of time that the root hair was able to maintain its tip focused fine meshwork of F actin as it elongated. These analyses showed thathlb1root hairs had a significantly lower ratio value than the wild type, indicating that the mutant largely failed to maintain its tip focused fine meshwork of F actin (Figure 4C).\n\nApical F Actin Organization Is Disrupted inhlb1Root Hairs.\n\n(A)Fine, dynamic mesh works of F actin at the extreme tip or subapical region of wild type root hairs (arrows) expressingUBQ10pro:GFP ABD2 GFP.

Means (n= 28 to 42 root hairs) +/ se(ttest, **P < 0.001).\n\nWe also asked whetherhlb1mutants had any measureable differences in global F actin dynamics when compared with the wild type. Global F actin dynamics was quantified from time lapse movie sequences obtained from a spinning disc confocal microscope using the metrics of pixel difference and correlation values developed earlier (Vidali et al., 2010). For this type of analysis, we focused our imaging on cortical F actin in root epidermal cells in the mature zone and the center of growing root hairs because cells in these areas of the root stayed within the same field of view during the entire 1 min time lapse sequence (Supplemental Movie 3). Time lapse data sets from epidermal cells of the root transition or elongation zone were significantly displaced as the primary root grew in the medium and therefore were not suitable for the global F actin analysis described here. Based on changes in pixel difference and correlation coefficient decay, there were no dramatic differences in global F actin dynamics between the wild type andhlb1(Supplemental Figure 6).\n\nBecause attempts to identify the mutation responsible for thehlb1phenotype by standard thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR were unsuccessful, we conducted map based cloning to identify theHLB1gene. We found that theAT5G41950gene had a 2 bp deletion in the first exon corresponding to amino acid 63 in thehlb1mutant (Arabidopsis Chromosome 5 Positions 16786010 and 16786011). This frameshift mutation resulted in a premature stop codon at amino acid 67, which may possibly lead to a truncated protein (Supplemental Figure 7A). To confirm whether loss ofAT5G41950corresponds tohlb1, we searched the publicly available SALK collection for T DNA insertions in theAT5G41950gene (Alonso et al., 2003). We genotyped the segregating progeny by PCR and identified homozygous plants for three SALK lines (SALK_046760, SALK_144501, and SALK_065836), which had insertions in the 8th exon, the 7th intron, and the 10th intron ofAT5G41950, respectively (Supplemental Figure 7B). Seedlings of these three T DNA insertion mutants exhibited similar hypersensitivity toLatBand root hair growth defects ashlb1, indicating that these were mutant alleles ofhlb1(Supplemental Figures 7C and 7D). The originalhlb1mutant was designated ashlb1 1, whereas SALK_046760, SALK_144501, and SALK_065836 were namedhlb1 2,hlb1 3, andhlb1 4, respectively (Supplemental Figure 7B). The average primary root length was significantly less than that of the wild type only inhlb1 2, which had an insertion in an exon, suggesting thathlb1 3andhlb1 4are weaker alleles (Supplemental Figure 7D). Thehlb1 1mutant allele was used for the analyses detailed below. Further evidence showing thathlb1is linked toAT5G41950was obtained from functional complementation ofhlb1by expression of an HLB1 GFP fusion protein that restored the wild type phenotype (see below).\n\nHLB1encodes a 565 amino acid protein of unknown function (Figure 5A). We analyzed 141 HLB1 homologs from 79 plant species to understand their phylogenetic relationship. Phylogenetic relationships were inferred by the maximum likelihood method (Le and Gascuel, 2008) using MEGA6 software (Tamura et al., 2013). Based on this analysis, HLB1 appears to be well conserved across the land plant lineage (Supplemental Figure 8). Sequence alignment of HLB1 homologs from six plant species representing moss, monocots, and eudicots showed that HLB1 has a highly variable N terminus, six tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, and a well conserved C terminus predicted to form a helical structure. The conservation of amino acids at the C terminus of several plant HLB1 proteins suggests that HLB1 has functional domains that have yet to be characterized (Figure 5B).\n\nHLB1 Domain Structure and Amino Acid Sequence Alignment with Homologs from Selected Land Plants.\n\n(A)Full length HLB1 domain structure showing the position of six TPR motifs and C terminal conserved domain (CTD).\n\n(B)Alignment of Arabidopsis HLB1 with HLB1 homologs from the five selected model species:Medicago truncatula,Populus trichocarpa,Oryza sativa,Brachypodium distachyon, andPhyscomitrella patens. Dark green shading depicts identical amino acid residues. Light green indicates other conserved residues.\n\nIncluding HLB1, the Arabidopsis genome has 147 proteins containing a total of 839TPRmotifs that are predicted to function in a range of biological processes and localize to a variety of subcellular compartments (Supplemental Data Set 1). However, HLB1 has no paralogs among any of the 146TPRmotif containing Arabidopsis proteins, indicating that it exists as a single gene. Furthermore, HLB1 is specific to land plants, as no homologous sequences were identified in fungi and animals.TPRdomains mediate protein protein interactions, and proteins containing these domains are part of protein complexes with diverse functions including transcriptional repression, protein import, heat shock, and cell cycle regulation (Blatch and Lssle, 1999;D'Andrea and Regan, 2003).TPRdomain containing proteins in plants have been implicated in responses to various hormones, assembly of the photosynthetic machinery, plastid partitioning, and root development (Jacobsen et al., 1996;Rosado et al., 2006;Yang et al., 2011;Hu et al., 2014;Bhuiyan et al., 2015).\n\nHLB1 fusions to GFP under the control of the nativeHLB1promoter (HLB1pro:HLB1 GFP) and theCaMV 35Spromoter (35Spro:GFP HLB1) were generated to gain more insight into HLB1 function. BothHLB1pro:HLB1 GFPand35Spro:GFP HLB1complemented theLatB hypersensitive and root hair phenotypes ofhlb1 1in young seedlings, indicating that the HLB1 fluorescent protein fusions are functional (Figures 6Aand6B;Supplemental Figure 9).\n\nA Functional HLB1 GFP Fusion Localizes to Endomembranes.\n\n(A)and(B)HLBpro:HLB1 GFPcomplements the hypersensitivity toLatBand short root hair phenotypes ofhlb1 1.

SeeSupplemental Movie 4for a corresponding time lapse sequence.\n\n(E)and(F)HLB1 GFP in the root elongation zone and root hairs form intracellular agglomerates (arrows) upon treatment with 50 uMBFA. Bars = 20 um.\n\nConfocal microscopy of cells from the elongation zone and root hairs ofhlb1 1seedlings expressingHLB1pro:HLB1 GFPrevealed that the fusion protein localized to the cytoplasm and decorated distinct and dynamic foci (Figures 6Cand6D;Supplemental Movie 4). The fluorescent bodies decorated by HLB1 GFP were reminiscent of those observed in plant cells expressing fluorescently tagged compartments of the endomembrane system (Geldner et al., 2009). Endomembrane compartments such as endosomes visualized with GFP have been shown to form large intracellular fluorescent agglomerates when treated with the fungal metabolite Brefeldin A (BFA) (Robinson et al., 2008). Consistent with the hypothesis that the HLB1 GFP bodies were associated with the endomembrane system, seedlings expressingHLB1pro:HLB1 GFPtreated with 50 uMBFAfor 1 h developed intracellular fluorescent agglomerates (Figures 6Eand6F).\n\nTo determine the identity of the endomembrane compartment with which HLB1 is associated,HLB1pro:HLB1 GFPlines were crossed with a set of marker lines expressing mCherry and CFP endomembrane markers (Nelson et al., 2007;Geldner et al., 2009). HLB1 GFP overlapped substantially with theTGNmarkers mCherry VTI12 and SYP61 CFP and an early/recycling endosomal marker, mCherry RabA1g (Figures 7Ato7D;Supplemental Movies 5 and 6), but not with the Golgi marker Man49 mCherry. Although the bodies decorated by HLB1 GFP and Man49 mCherry were clearly distinct, many HLB1 GFP bodies were adjacent to the larger Golgi bodies and often moved alongside Golgi stacks, a feature typical ofTGNdynamics (Supplemental Movie 7) (Uemura et al., 2014). A number of HLB1 GFP bodies were also observed to move independently of Man49 mCherry (Supplemental Movie 7). HLB1 GFP did not overlap substantially with mCherry ARA6, a marker for the late endosomes/prevacuolar compartment (PVC) (Figure 7E;Supplemental Movie 8). The extent of colocalization of HLB1 GFP with selected endomembrane markers was quantified by extracting Pearson's correlation coefficients from scatterplots of green red image pairs (Manders et al., 1993;Costes et al., 2004;Bottanelli et al., 2012) (Figure 7F). The Pearson's correlation coefficient was higher in the HLB1 GFP mCherry VTI12 pair when compared with the HLB1 GFP mCherry RabA1g pair. The higher value for the HLB1 GFP mCherry VTI12 pair indicates that HLB1 foci are associated more closely with the VTI12 residentTGN/EEpopulation and to a lesser extent with recycling endosomes decorated by RabA1g (Figure 7G). Lower Pearson's correlation coefficients were obtained from the HLB1 GFP mCherry ARA6 pair, consistent with visual observations of minimal overlap between HLB1 and late endosomes/PVC(Figures 7Eand7G;Supplemental Movie 8). Together, these data strongly support the conclusion that HLB1 is aTGN/EE localized protein.\n\nHLB1 GFP Colocalizes withTrans Golgi Network and Early/Recycling Endosome Markers.\n\n(A)and(B)Peripheral root cap(A)and epidermal cells in the root elongation zone(B)coexpressing HLB1 GFP and mCherry VTI12, aTGNmarker.

To determine whether these domains target HLB1 to theTGN/EE, we generated GFP fusions to truncated HLB1 where either the sixTPRmotifs (GFP HLB1TPR) or the conserved C terminus (GFP HLB1CTD) was deleted (Supplemental Figure 10A). When expressed in seedlings, the GFP HLB1CTDfusion that had the intactTPRmotifs localized exclusively to the cytoplasm. By contrast, the GFP HLB1TPRwith the conserved C terminus localized to both the cytoplasm andTGN/EEbodies, similar to the localization of full length HLB1 (Supplemental Figure 10B). Taken together, the data indicate that the C terminus of HLB1 is responsible for its localization to theTGN/EE.\n\nGiven that thehlb1mutant is hypersensitive toLatB, we tested the association of HLB1 GFP TGNs with F actin in planta. HLB1 GFP plants were crossed with plants expressing the red fluorescent F actin constructUBQ10pro:mCherry ABD2 mCherry(Dyachok et al., 2014). It was difficult to obtain clear images of mCherry ABD2 mCherry and HLB1 GFP bodies together in root cells that were highly cytoplasmic because the HLB1 GFP cytoplasmic component would often obscure the red F actin label. Thus, imaging of mCherry ABD2 mCherry and HLB1 GFP was conducted on vacuolated epidermal cells of the root maturation zone and fully mature root hairs, where signal from the cytoplasm was minimal. In these cell types, HLB1 GFP bodies aligned with and tracked along F actin bundles in a \"beads on a string\" like localization, typical of actin membrane adaptors such as the NET proteins, which are associated with the actin cytoskeleton in vivo (Figures 8Aand8B;Supplemental Movies 9 and 10) (Wang et al., 2014).\n\nHLB1 GFP Tracks along F Actin Cables in Living Cells.\n\nRoot epidermal cell from the maturation zone(A)and the base of a mature root hair(B)coexpressing HLB1 GFP and mCherry ABD2 mCherry (mCh ABD2 mCh), an F actin marker. Arrows indicate individual or clusters of HLB1 GFP bodies aligned along the red emitting F actin cables. SeeSupplemental Movies 9 and 10for corresponding time lapse sequences. Bars = 10 um.\n\nThe increased sensitivity ofhlb1toLatBprompted us to ask whether the HLB1 GFP bodies themselves responded toLatBtreatment. We found that roots of seedlings formed intracellular HLB1 GFP agglomerates within 10 min ofLatBapplication. However, otherTGNmarkers, including YFP VTI12 and SYP61 CFP, formed similar aggregates as HLB1 GFP afterLatBtreatment, indicating that the compound has a global effect onTGNdistribution in root cells (Supplemental Figure 11).\n\nBioinformatic analyses indicated that HLB1 is a highly conserved protein that did not diverge much during the split between eudicots and monocots (Supplemental Figure 8). To test whether an HLB1 ortholog from a monocot could have similar functions as the Arabidopsis HLB1, the rice (Oryza sativa)HLB1gene (Os HLB1) was cloned and a35Spro:OsHLB1 GFPconstruct was generated. The OsHLB1 GFP fusion partially complemented theLatB hypersensitive phenotype of Arabidopsishlb1but fully complemented its short primary root defects. Furthermore, OsHLB1 GFP localized to the cytoplasm and labeled similar dynamic punctate bodies as the Arabidopsis HLB1 GFP in thehlb1 1mutant background (Supplemental Figures 12A and 12B). The partial complementation ofhlb1by OsHLB1 GFP and similar localization patterns as the Arabidopsis HLB1 supports the conclusion that the role of HLB1 in endomembrane traffic is likely conserved in land plants.\n\nBecauseTPRdomains are known to mediate protein protein interactions (D'Andrea and Regan, 2003), coimmunoprecipitation (co IP) experiments were performed to identify proteins interacting with HLB1 using roots ofhlb1 1seedlings complemented with the35Spro:GFP HLB1construct (Supplemental Figure 9). Seedlings expressing35Spro:GFPserved as control plants. GFP HLB1 and its putative interactors were coimmunoprecipitated using anti GFP serum. Coimmunoprecipitated proteins from35Spro:GFP HLB1and35Spro:GFPseedlings were analyzed with SDS PAGE, and the components were identified by mass spectrometry based proteomic analysis. Peptides corresponding to both HLB1 and GFP were readily detected in the coimmunoprecipitates from the roots of the35Spro:GFP HLB1line, indicating successful isolation of chimeric GFP HLB1 from the root extracts (Figure 9A;Supplemental Data Set 2).\n\nMIN7/BEN1 Interacts with HLB1 andben1Phenocopies the Hypersensitivity toLatBand Root Hair Phenotypes ofhlb1.\n\n(A)Heat map of two independentco IPexperiments from roots of the GFP only control and GFP HLB1 seedlings indicating relative abundance of peptides. GFP peptides were detected in all the samples.

Bar = 10 um.\n\n(E)Pearson's correlation coefficients were similar between MIN7/BEN1 GFP and HLB1 mCherry and HLB1 GFP and mCherry VTI12 (ttest; n.s., not significant).\n\nTwo independentco IPexperiments were conducted, and proteins present in35Spro:GFP HLB1immunoprecipitates but not in35Spro:GFPcontrols were considered for further analyses. Surprisingly, the firstco IPexperiment yielded a limited number of proteins with only 22 proteins unique to35Spro:GFP HLB1. By contrast, the secondco IPexperiment yielded 650 proteins unique to35Spro:GFP HLB1. It is unclear why there was a large discrepancy in the protein list between two independentco IPexperiments. In bothco IPexperiments, however, peptides of HOPM INTERACTOR7/BREFELDIN A VISUALIZED ENDOCYTIC TRAFFICKING DEFECTIVE1 (MIN7/BEN1) were detected as unique to35Spro:GFP HLB1root extracts (Nomura et al., 2006;Tanaka et al., 2009). To validate the results of the twoco IPexperiments, a reciprocalco IPwas conducted with root extracts of35Spro:MIN7/BEN1 GFP(Nomura et al., 2011). Consistent with the possibility that MIN7/BEN1 interacts with HLB1, HLB1 peptides were identified in the immunoprecipitates of35Spro:MIN7/BEN1 GFPbut not in the35Spro:GFPcontrols (Figure 9A).\n\nMIN7/BEN1 has been previously shown to localize to theTGN/EEand function in endocytosis ofPMproteins (Tanaka et al., 2009;Nomura et al., 2011;Tanaka et al., 2013). Therefore, its connection to HLB1 was evaluated in more detail. Genetic and pharmacological evidence that MIN7/BEN1 is biologically relevant to HLB1 function was obtained from analyses ofmin7/ben1mutants (SALK_013761), which we refer to here asben1for simplicity. Roots of theben1mutant were hypersensitive toLatB, as much ashlb1(Figure 9B). Even in the absence ofLatB,ben1had short primary roots and root hairs, mirroringhlb1phenotypes (Figure 9C;Supplemental Figure 13). To determine if HLB1 and MIN7/BEN1 colocalized in planta, we generated an HLB1 mCherry fusion and expressed it in plants harboring MIN7/BEN1 GFP (Nomura et al., 2011). Spinning disc confocal microscopy observations followed by quantitative colocalization analyses revealed that HLB1 mCherry bodies overlapped significantly with MIN7/BEN1 GFP foci, providing support to ourco IPresults that the two proteins indeed interact in vivo (Figures 9Dand9E;Supplemental Movie 11).\n\nA mutant allele ofben1was isolated from a confocal microscopy based forward genetic screen for defects in the internalization of the PIN FORMED (PIN)PM localized auxin efflux carriers.ben1was found to be defective in endocytic trafficking as it had diminished ability to form PIN GFP agglomerates when treated withBFA(Tanaka et al., 2009,2013). Becauseben1mirrored theLatBhypersensitivity and root hair phenotypes ofhlb1(Figure 9), we hypothesized thathlb1could also have defects in the formation of intracellular PIN agglomerates when exposed toBFA. PIN2 GFP was therefore expressed inhlb1and treated withBFA. Like wild type roots,hlb1roots accumulated intracellular PIN2 GFP agglomerates after 1 h exposure to 50 uMBFA(Figure 10A). Although the number of PIN2 GFP agglomerates per cell inhlb1and the wild type was not statistically different, fluorescence ofBFA induced agglomerates was more intense inhlb1compared with the wild type when imaged under similar confocal microscopy settings (Figures 10Band10C). The stronger fluorescence intensity of PIN2 GFP agglomerates inhlb1prompted us to ask whether thehlb1mutation might be affecting the recycling of PIN2 GFP to thePM. To address this question,BFAwashout experiments were conducted on wild type andhlb1seedlings expressing PIN2 GFP. After 1 to 2 h ofBFAwashout, the number of PIN2 GFP agglomerates in wild type roots decreased significantly, whereas those in thehlb1mutant background persisted (Figures 10Aand10C).\n\nhlb1Is Defective in Recycling of PIN2 GFP to the Plasma Membrane.\n\n(A)One hour treatment withBFAresults in the formation of intracellular PIN2 GFP agglomerates in both the wild type andhlb1.

Values are means (n= 341 root cortical cells) +/ sefrom at least 15 independent seedlings (ttest, ***P < 0.0001).\n\nThe PIN2 trafficking phenotypes observed inhlb1were surprisingly opposite to those reported forben1but strikingly similar to those described for a class of dominant membrane trafficking mutants calledbex(forbfa visualized exocytic trafficking defective) (Feraru et al., 2012;Tanaka et al., 2014). In addition to the persistence of PIN agglomerates afterBFAwashout,bex1andbex5mutants formed intracellular PIN2 GFP agglomerates in response to low (10 uM) concentrations ofBFA, whereas the wild type showed only minor agglomerate formation (Feraru et al., 2012;Tanaka et al., 2014).hlb1seedlings expressing PIN2 GFP were therefore treated with 10 uMBFAfor 1 and 3 h to determine ifhlb1trafficking defects mirrored those reported forbex1andbex5. Consistent with previous studies, 10 uMBFAinduced only minor intracellular accumulation of PIN2 GFP in wild type seedlings (Figure 10D). By contrast,hlb1roots exposed to 10 uMBFAfor the same time periods as the wild type showed significant formation of PIN2 GFP agglomerates that were reminiscent of thebexmutants (Figures 10Dand10E) (Feraru et al., 2012;Tanaka et al., 2014). Taken together, the data indicate that HLB1 functions in protein recycling to thePM.\n\nBecausehlb1is hypersensitive toLatBand the actin cytoskeleton has been implicated in the intracellular trafficking of PIN proteins (Geldner et al., 2001;Nagawa et al., 2012), we hypothesized that PIN2 GFP recycling in thehlb1background could also exhibit heightened sensitivity to concentrations ofLatBthat only minimally affected PIN2 GFP recycling in the wild type. To test this hypothesis, the wild type andhlb1expressing PIN2 GFP were treated with 50 nMLatB. At thisLatBconcentration, PIN2 GFP in roots of the wild type formed a few, weakly fluorescing intracellular PIN2 GFP agglomerates within 1 h of exposure to the drug. On the other hand, roots ofhlb1seedlings formed bright and numerous PIN2 GFP intracellular agglomerates that were reminiscent ofBFA induced PIN2 GFP bodies (Figures 10Fto10H). These results indicate that the recycling of PIN2 GFP to thePMinhlb1is more sensitive toLatBcompared with the wild type and consistent with the heightened response of its roots and F actin structures to the chemical.\n\nWe next asked if the localization of PIN2 GFP was altered inhlb1root cells withoutBFAorLatBtreatment. Live cell microscopy and corresponding quantitative analyses showed that PIN2 GFP signal in thehlb1background was higher in thePMand in the cell interior compared with the wild type when imaged with similar confocal microscopy settings. The stronger fluorescence in the cell interior ofhlb1root cells was due to brighter and more distinct PIN2 GFP foci (Figures 11Aand11B).\n\nPIN2 GFP Distribution, Constitutive Secretion, and Traffic to the Vacuole Are Partially Disrupted inhlb1.\n\n(A)Representative images of non LatB treated root cells expressing PIN2 GFP.

A higher ratio indicates strong RFP AFVY accumulation in the apoplast. Values are means (n= 38 to 43 cells from 15 independent seedlings) +/ se(ttest, ***P < 0.0001).\n\nThe more intense PIN2 GFP signals in thePMand cell interior ofhlb1roots was reminiscent of observations made inbex5, which showed similar PIN2 GFP recycling defects ashlb1(Feraru et al., 2012). Given the defects in PIN2 GFP recycling inhlb1, we asked whether the distribution of aTGN/EEmarker was altered in the mutant. To address this question, we expressed YFP VTI12 in thehlb1background. The distribution of YFP VTI12 foci in peripheral root cap cells was similar in the wild type andhlb1(Supplemental Figure 14A). Furthermore, global analyses of YFP VTI12 dynamics in root hairs revealed no appreciable differences between the wild type andhlb1(Supplemental Figures 14B and 14CandSupplemental Movie 12). Because we established that MIN7/BEN1 is an HLB1 interactor at theTGN/EE, we also looked at the distribution of MIN7/BEN1 GFP in thehlb1background. Unfortunately, lines expressing MIN7/BEN1 GFP inhlb1and the wild type were extensively silenced and we could observe GFP signal only from cells in the peripheral root cap. Like YFP VTI12, the distribution of MIN7/BEN1 GFP in these cells was similar between the wild type andhlb1(Supplemental Figure 14D). Although we did not detect any substantial differences between the wild type andhlb1with regard to VTI12 or MIN7/BEN1 distribution at the light microscope level, we cannot discount the possibility thatTGN/EEultrastructure might be affected in thehlb1mutant as has been reported inbex5(Feraru et al., 2012).\n\nBecause conspicuous differences between the wild type andhlb1were noted with regard to PIN2 GFP intensity in thePMand cell interior (Figures 11Aand11B), we next asked ifhlb1displayed anypin2 like phenotypes in regard to seedling root development. Consistent with previous reports,pin2seedlings had distinct root agravitropic defects as evident from their high deviation from vertical growth (Mller et al., 1998). By contrast, the deviation from vertical growth ofhlb1roots was similar to the wild type (Supplemental Figures 15A and 15B). Moreover, although the deviation from vertical growth ofpin2roots appeared to be enhanced byLatB, their primary roots exhibited wild type growth sensitivity toLatB(Supplemental Figures 15C and 15D). Root deviation from vertical growth ofben1andhlb1 ben1was similar tohlb1and the wild type (Supplemental Figures 15A and 15B). These data indicate that the HLB1 MIN7/BEN1 residentTGNcomplex is not required for full functionality of PIN2.\n\nBecause PIN2 recycling is defective inhlb1and post Golgi traffic of some PIN proteins is a crucial component of the root gravitropic response (Kleine Vehn et al., 2008;Kleine Vehn et al., 2010), we next asked whetherhlb1roots were compromised in gravitropism. Seedlings of the wild type andhlb1with roots growing vertically were rotated by 90 degrees, and the kinetics of root curvature was monitored at various time points for a 12 h period. No measureable differences in root gravitropic response between wild type andhlb1seedlings under our growth conditions were noted (Supplemental Figures 15E and 15F).\n\nThe impaired trafficking of PIN2 GFP to thePMinhlb1could be due to defects in protein secretion or recycling. We therefore expressed the secreted (SEC) RFP fusion, a bulk flow secretion reporter, inhlb1(Faso et al., 2009;Renna et al., 2013) to determine whether the mutant has defects in constitutive secretion mechanisms. We first examined SEC RFP in actively elongating root hairs because the tips of these cell types are characterized by active secretion (Preuss et al., 2004), and the most obvious growth and F actin organizational defects ofhlb1seedlings were observed in root hairs (Figures 3and4). Using spinning disc confocal microscopy, we found that growing root hairs of the wild type had intense SEC RFP fluorescence at the extreme tip. By contrast, mosthlb1root hairs had weak SEC RFP fluorescence at the tip or failed to maintain a distinct tip focused SEC RFP gradient (Figure 11C;Supplemental Movie 13). The tip focused SEC RFP gradient was quantified by obtaining the ratio of the average SEC RFP fluorescence at the tip apex to the average SEC RFP fluorescence at the subapex from 1 min time lapse movie sequences (Figure 11D). We found that ratio values at every 10 s time point were higher in the wild type compared withhlb1, verifying our visual observations that secretion in root hair tips ofhlb1is altered (Figure 11E). Furthermore, retention of SEC RFP in theERappeared to be more pronounced inhlb1cotyledons compared with the wild type (Figure 11F). However, like in the wild type, strong SEC RFP fluorescence was still observed in the apoplast of various cell types ofhlb1seedlings (Figure 11F;Supplemental Figures 16A to 16D). Taken together, our results indicate that bulk flow secretion inhlb1is only partially affected, a defect that is most strongly manifested in growing root hairs, which have measurable F actin defects.\n\nThe localization of HLB1 to theTGN/EEsuggests that other post Golgi trafficking pathways such as trafficking to the vacuole might be affected in thehlb1mutant. To address this question, we expressed RFP AFVY, a fusion to the C terminal of phaseolin that accumulates in the vacuole lumen (Hunter et al., 2007). Because RFP AFVY was strongly silenced in root cells, we focused our analyses on hypocotyls and cotyledons. We found that RFP AFVY in hypocotyl and cotyledon epidermal cells ofhlb1seedlings appeared to be mis sorted to the apoplast (Figure 11G). Mis sorting of RFP AFVY was quantified by obtaining the ratio of fluorescence from a fixed region of the apoplast to an equivalent area within the vacuole lumen in epidermal cells of the hypocotyl (Figure 11G). The higher ratio values forhlb1compared with the wild type support that RFP AFVY is mis sorted in the mutant (Figure 11H). However, RFP AFVY still accumulated in the vacuole lumen of several cell types inhlb1similar to the wild type, indicating that vacuolar targeting defects in the mutant are only partial (Figure 11G).\n\nOther evidence showing that trafficking to the vacuole inhlb1is not completely compromised was obtained from incubating wild type andhlb1seedlings expressing PIN2 GFP in the dark for 12 h. Under such conditions, PIN2 GFP in the wild type was shown to accumulate in lytic vacuoles (Feraru et al., 2012). Here, we observed that both the wild type andhlb1accumulated PIN2 GFP in lytic vacuoles in the dark (Supplemental Figure 16E). In addition, the styryl dye FM1 43 labeled the tonoplast in elongating root cells of light grownhlb1seedlings, indicating that trafficking to the vacuole can still proceed in the mutant. FM1 43 labeling of root cells in the elongation zone andDICmicroscopy of peripheral root cap cells also did not reveal dramatic differences in vacuolar morphology between the wild type andhlb1(Supplemental Figures 16F and 16G). However, the possibility that there are subtle differences in vacuolar dynamics and morphology between the wild type andhlb1cannot be ruled out. Furthermore, differences in vacuole morphology between the wild type andhlb1could be more apparent in other cell types or amplified under certain growth conditions (e.g., light versus dark).\n\nAs noted above, it was previously shown thatben1had reduced intracellular accumulation of PIN GFP following treatment with 50 uMBFA, a phenotype opposite to that ofhlb1(Tanaka et al., 2009,2013). The opposite trafficking phenotypes ofben1andhlb1were surprising given their similar root developmental phenotypes andLatBhypersensitivity (Figure 9). To better understand the genetic relationship betweenhlb1andben1,hlb1 ben1double mutants were generated and their phenotypes were compared withhlb1andben1single mutants. The extent of hypersensitivity ofhlb1 ben1double mutants toLatBwas similar to singlehlb1andben1mutants (Supplemental Figure 13A). Furthermore, root hair length ofhlb1 ben1in the absence ofLatBwas slightly shorter thanhlb1single mutants but similar toben1single mutants. In addition,hlb1 ben1had slightly shorter primary roots inLatB free media compared withhlb1andben1single mutants (Supplemental Figures 13B to 13D).\n\nWe next asked how trafficking ofPMmarkers is affected inhlb1 ben1double mutants compared withhlb1andben1single mutants. For these assays, we used the endocytic styryl tracer dye FM1 43. Consistent with the PIN2 GFP assays, FM1 43 in the wild type andhlb1formed fluorescent agglomerates after a 1 h treatment with 50 uMBFA(Figures 12Aand12B). Also in agreement with the PIN2 GFP assays was the observation that FM1 43 agglomerates persisted inhlb1compared with the wild type afterBFAwashout (Supplemental Figure 17). By contrast,ben1had diminished accumulation of FM1 43 agglomerates afterBFAtreatment, in agreement with previous reports (Figure 12C) (Tanaka et al., 2009,2013). Inhlb1 ben1, FM1 43 accumulation was diminished to a similar extent asben1single mutants (Figures 12Dand12E). The similarLatB hypersensitive response and root growth defects ofhlb1 ben1to singlehlb1andben1mutants indicate thathlb1andben1function in common genetic pathways. Becausehlb1 ben1trafficking and root hair defects mirrored those of theben1single mutant,ben1likely functions upstream ofhlb1.\n\nHLB1Acts Downstream ofBEN1.\n\n(A)to(D)Intracellular accumulation of the styryl dye FM 1 43 is altered inben1andhlb1 ben1but not in the wild type orhlb1.

Values are means (n> 200 cells) +/ sefrom at least 20 independent seedlings.

Statistical significance was determined by one way ANOVA. Values are means (n= 18 to 32 roots) +/ se. Different letters indicate significant differences among means (P < 0.05; Tukey's test).\n\nAnother phenotype reported forben1seedlings is their hypersensitivity to growth on moderate concentrations ofBFA(Tanaka et al., 2009). Given that bothben1andhlb1phenocopied each other in regard to root development and hypersensitivity toLatB, the response ofhlb1toBFAwas examined. Consistent with previous reports,ben1seedlings displayed heightened sensitivity to low doses ofBFAcompared with the wild type. By contrast,hlb1seedlings showed wild type sensitivity toBFA. Furthermore, seedlings of thehlb1 ben1double mutant displayed similar hypersensitivity toBFAcompared to seedlings ofben1single mutants, providing additional genetic evidence thatben1functions upstream ofhlb1(Figures 12Fand12G).",
    "discussion": "The endomembrane system is essential for normal plant cell development, yet many protein components that modulate its function remain to be identified. The distinct effects of cytoskeleton disrupting chemicals on plant growth provide the basis for convenient forward genetic screens to isolate mutants with altered sensitivity to these compounds. However, such screens have rarely been applied for studies on the plant cytoskeleton despite their strong potential to uncover mechanisms underlying the cytoskeletal basis of plant development. Forward genetic screens to isolate mutants that respond differentially to cytoskeleton disrupting compounds have been limited to those that alter microtubules (Naoi and Hashimoto, 2004;Paredez et al., 2008). Here, we used a forward genetic approach with the potent actin disrupting compoundLatBand identified the recessive mutanthlb1, which displayed enhancedLatBsensitivity compared with the wild type. We determined thatHLB1encodes a sixTPRmotif containing protein with a conserved C terminal domain. We found that HLB1 is a plant specific protein that could potentially link the actin cytoskeleton with post Golgi traffic. Loss of function ofHLB1leads to alterations in protein recycling to thePMand to an F actin network that is more susceptible to actin specific chemical antagonists. This, in turn, results in seedlings with root hair polarity defects and reduced primary root growth. We demonstrated that HLB1 associates with theTGN/EEthrough its conserved C terminal domain and functions with theTGN/EE localized ARF GEF protein MIN7/BEN1 (Nomura et al., 2006;Tanaka et al., 2009) in overlapping endomembrane trafficking pathways. These data provide important insight into a previously undescribed component of the endomembrane trafficking machinery that is highly conserved and unique to land plants.\n\nOur work experimentally demonstrates that aTPRdomain protein, namely, HLB1, is localized to post Golgi compartments. OtherTPRdomain containing proteins among the 147 in Arabidopsis, including SHORT AND SWOLLEN ROOT1 and MET1, localize to mitochondria and chloroplasts, respectively, consistent with their functions in oxidative stress mediated root development and in the assembly of the photosynthetic apparatus (Bhuiyan et al., 2015;Zhang et al., 2015). TheTPRprotein CLUMPED CHLOROPLAST1 (CLMP1) localizes to distinct foci in the cytoplasm. Although the exact identity of the CLMP1 foci remains unknown, their adjacent location to chloroplasts supports their role in plastid partitioning and distribution (Yang et al., 2011). Here, we show that theTGN/EE localized HLB1 protein functions in the recycling of proteins and other lipophilic cargo from post Golgi compartments to thePMafter their uptake by endocytosis. This conclusion is supported by the observation thatBFA induced PIN2 GFP and FM1 43 agglomerates persisted inhlb1mutants afterBFAwashout.\n\nhlb1also had partial defects in constitutive secretion, which were most apparent in cells of young seedlings including root hairs and epidermal pavement cells of cotyledons. In this regard,LatBtreatment was previously shown to alter the tip localization of theTGN localized secretory marker YFP RabA4B in growing root hairs (Preuss et al., 2004). The disrupted gradient of F actin meshwork inhlb1root hairs could explain the tip secretion and root hair growth defects of the mutant. The mis sorting of RFP AFVY to the apoplast ofhlb1is reminiscent of another post Golgi trafficking mutant calledunhinged 1, which is disrupted in a gene encoding VASCULAR SORTING PROTEIN51 (Pahari et al., 2014). Mis sorting of RFP AFVY was only partial as the marker still accumulated to a large extent in the vacuole lumen ofhlb1. The RFP AFVY assays were verified by observations that PIN2 GFP accumulated in lytic vacuoles when incubated in the dark and that FM1 43 decorated the tonoplast inhlb1. Future studies will determine whether other markers of vacuolar targeting and morphology are altered inhlb1.\n\nIn animals, someTPRdomain proteins localize to the endomembrane system. For instance, the endosome localized sorting nexins SNX20 and SNX21 containTPRmotifs in addition to their phox homology (PX) phosphoinositide binding domain. These sorting nexins have been proposed to function as membrane associated scaffolding proteins that could potentially interact with transmembrane ligands for transport through the endomembrane system (Clairfeuille et al., 2015). In addition to theTPRmotifs, HLB1 contains a C terminal domain that is highly conserved among land plants. Protein domain prediction software indicates that this C terminal domain can form a helical structure and manual annotation revealed that it had weak similarity (15%) to the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of Arabidopsis PLECKSTRIN HOMOLOG1. Like PX domains, PH domains bind to phosphoinositides and could facilitate targeting of proteins containing these domains to membranes (Boss and Im, 2012). Consistent with the possibility that the C terminal domain of HLB1 has similar functions to canonical PX or PH domains, we showed through GFP HLB1 deletion constructs that HLB1 localized toTGN/EEcompartments primarily through its C terminal domain. Although direct binding of the HLB1 to lipids has yet to be demonstrated, the root hair defects ofhlb1suggest that the HLB1 C terminal domain could provide a mechanism for integrating phosphoinositide signaling with actin mediated tip growth regulation. In this regard, phosphoinositides have been implicated in actin mediated root hair tip growth (Vincent et al., 2005;Yoo et al., 2012) and mutants disrupted in various steps of phosphoinositide metabolism have altered root hair development (Kusano et al., 2008;Stenzel et al., 2008;Thole et al., 2008) that mirrors the root hair phenotypes ofhlb1. One explanation for the root hair defects of thehlb1mutant is that HLB1 functions in recycling of phosphoinositide metabolizing enzymes or phosphoinositides to thePMof the root hair apex. Future studies will test this hypothesis using fluorescently tagged phosphoinositide reporters and enzymes.\n\nThe trafficking defects ofhlb1were similar to the previously characterized dominantbex1andbex5mutants (Feraru et al., 2012;Tanaka et al., 2014). In this regard, we speculate that BEX1, an ARF1A1C small GTPase, and BEX5, a RABA1b small GTPase, could functionally converge onto similar trafficking pathways mediated by HLB1. It is important to note, however, that despite the similarities in membrane trafficking phenotypes ofhlb1to those of thebexmutants, they differed in their seedling sensitivity toBFA. Whereasbex1andbex5seedling growth was reported to be hypersensitive to moderateBFAconcentrations (Feraru et al., 2012;Tanaka et al., 2014),hlb1seedlings showed wild typeBFAsensitivity. T DNA knockoutbex5mutants did not show the trafficking defects characteristic of the dominant negativebex5 1, suggesting functional redundancy with other closely related RABA1b GTPases (Feraru et al., 2012). In the future, it will be interesting to test howbexloss of function mutants respond toLatBand to determine whether ARF1A1C and RABA1b operate in common exocytic trafficking pathways as HLB1. Although HLB1 is encoded by a single Arabidopsis gene and thehlb1mutant showed clear defects in exocytosis and heightened sensitivity toLatB, the mild root phenotypes ofhlb1in the absence ofLatBsuggests that HLB1 could function redundantly with other unknown nonhomologous proteins in plant development.\n\nA significant finding from our study is the identification of MIN7/BEN1, aTGN/EE localized ARF GEF protein belonging to the BIG subfamily (Nomura et al., 2006;Tanaka et al., 2009), as an HLB1 interactor. Although the nature of the HLB1 MIN7/BEN1 interaction at the biochemical level has yet to be established, results presented here point to HLB1 and MIN7/BEN1 operating in converging endomembrane trafficking pathways. In addition to the clear colocalization of HLB1 and MIN7/BEN1 in distinctTGN/EEfoci, double mutant studies demonstrate thatben1is epistatic tohlb1with regard toLatBhypersensitivity, FM1 43 recycling, root hair growth, and sensitivity to moderate concentrations ofBFA. Because thehlb1 ben1double mutant most closely resembles the phenotypes of theben1single mutant,MIN7/BEN1likely functions upstream ofHLB1. This observation reinforces the conclusion that thehlb1mutant is deficient specifically in endocytic membrane recycling. The epistatic effect ofben1onhlb1with respect to the formation of FM1 43BFAbodies suggests that inhlb1, the pool ofPM derived cargo forTGN regulated recycling likely originates from endocytic uptake mediated by BEN1.\n\nIn addition to the root hair tip growth defects and strong hypersensitivity ofhlb1seedlings toLatB, our results support the possibility that HLB1 may exert its functions in endomembrane traffic through actin. This is supported by several lines of evidence. First, confocal microscopy analyses showed that the HLB1 GFP bodies tracked along F actin bundles in vivo. HLB1 GFP localization was reminiscent of the \"beads on a string\" pattern exhibited by the NET family of actin membrane adaptors (Wang et al., 2014). Second, the localization of the HLB1 GFP foci was rapidly disrupted by low doses ofLatB. Third, PIN2 GFP recycling to thePM, which was only minimally affected by low doses ofLatBin the wild type, was severely inhibited inhlb1. TheLatB induced PIN2 GFP agglomerates were strikingly similar to those induced by high concentrations ofBFA. Despite these results, we cannot discard the possibility that the movement of HLB1 GFP punctae along F actin could simply reflect that HLB1 is on theTGN/EEsurface, which would not support specific functional linkage between actin and HLB1. Furthermore, we have found thatLatBalso rapidly affected the distribution of otherTGN/EEmarkers in root cells, indicating that the observed effects of the drug on HLB1 localization are not exclusive for this protein. Nonetheless, we showed that actin dynamics in the tip of elongating root hairs are disrupted inhlb1in support of the notion that HLB1 could be linked to actin function. The lack of differences in F actin organization and dynamics in cells of the root elongation zone between non LatB treated wild type andhlb1does not preclude the possibility that subtle differences in F actin dynamics exist between the wild type andhlb1, and such differences may manifest only at the level of single actin filaments (Staiger et al., 2009). While a direct interaction between HLB1 with actin awaits for experimental validation, our analyses support that HLB1 exerts a role in post Golgi membrane traffic in relation to the actin cytoskeleton, which may occur either directly or through interactions with actin modulators.\n\nThe involvement of the actin cytoskeleton in endocytosis and protein recycling has been documented in plants using both pharmacological and genetic approaches. For example, sterol endocytosis was found to be disrupted inact2mutants and by treating wild type plants with cytochalasin D (Grebe et al., 2003).LatBand cytochalasin were also shown to influence the recycling and polar localization of PIN proteins in root and leaf epidermal cells (Geldner et al., 2001;Nagawa et al., 2012). Finally,LatBwas reported to interfere with protein traffic to the vacuole in protoplasts and intact roots (Kim et al., 2005). It is important to note, however, that in the aforementioned studies, high micromolar concentrations ofLatBwere used to trigger the reported effects on protein trafficking. The fact thathlb1displayed strong protein trafficking and seedling growth defects in response to low nanomolar doses ofLatBsupports the hypothesis that HLB1 is a crucial component of post Golgi traffic that is strongly dependent on the maintenance of an intact actin cytoskeleton. This hypothesis is further reinforced by the observation that heightened sensitivity toLatBwas more pronounced inhlb1andben1mutants compared with mutants with lesions in genes encoding actin itself (e.g.,act2andact8) or mutants to a suite of other actin regulatory proteins, most of which were notLatBhypersensitive. In this regard, another possible explanation for the hypersensitivity ofhlb1mutants toLatBis that loss of function ofHLB1causes mild recycling defects of several proteins directly involved in actin function particularly those that localized to thePM. The collective recycling defects of severalPM localized actin regulatory proteins, although mild, could sensitizehlb1to even low doses of actin antagonists.\n\nDespite the recycling defects of PIN2 GFP in thehlb1background,hlb1did not exhibit the agravitropic phenotype characteristic ofpin2mutants and were not compromised in root gravitropism when reoriented by 90 degrees. The absence of any measurablepin2 like phenotypes inhlb1,ben1, andhlb1 ben1double mutants supports that the protein recycling defects resulting from loss of HLB1 and BEN1 function may not be sufficient to completely alter certain PIN2 mediated seedling root growth processes. This observation further reinforces the hypothesis that HLB1 and BEN1 function redundantly with other yet to be identifiedTGN/EE localized proteins in cargo recycling. The possibility that HLB1 has redundant functions with other nonhomologous proteins can also be inferred from the lack of global defects in VTI12 and MIN7/BEN1 distribution in thehlb1mutant. Alternatively, MIN7/BEN1 could recruit HLB1 to theTGN/EEexplaining the lack of any dramatic differences in MIN7/BEN1 GFP distribution between the wild type andhlb1. By contrast, root gravitropism has been shown to be driven by differential degradation of PIN2 in the vacuole of cells in the elongation zone and PIN3 relocalization to the bottom side of the columella cellPM(Kleine Vehn et al., 2008,2010). The lack of root gravitropism defects inhlb1is consistent with the observation that loss of HLB1 function has only mild effects on vacuolar trafficking and suggests that HLB1 mediated PIN2 recycling to thePMhas minimal contributions to root gravitropic responses. The normal root gravity response ofhlb1also indicates that unlike PIN2, recycling of PIN3 and possibly other PIN proteins is independent of HLB1 function. However, additional experiments are needed to determine whether the trafficking of other PIN orPM localized proteins is affected in thehlb1mutant.\n\nIn summary, a forward genetic screen for altered sensitivity to the actin disrupting drugLatBled to the discovery of a previously uncharacterized protein involved in endomembrane trafficking in plants. TheTPRdomain containing HLB1 protein, which is encoded by a single gene in Arabidopsis, functions in protein recycling to thePMbut could also contribute to constitutive secretion and trafficking to the vacuole in specific cell types. The shared phenotypes ofhlb1with other exocytic and endocytic trafficking mutants such asben1,bex1, andbex5indicate that theTGN/EE localized HLB1 protein lies at a crucial step where exocytic and endocytic pathways converge and therefore represent a class of plant specific membrane scaffolding proteins likely involved in linking post Golgi traffic with the actin cytoskeleton.",
