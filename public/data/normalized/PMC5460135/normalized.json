    "abstract": "Astronauts have been previously shown to exhibit decreased salivary lysozyme and increased dental calculus and gingival inflammation in response to space flight, host factors that could contribute to oral diseases such as caries and periodontitis. However, the specific physiological response of caries causing bacteria such asStreptococcus mutansto space flight and/or ground based simulated microgravity has not been extensively investigated. In this study, high aspect ratio vesselS. mutanssimulated microgravity and normal gravity cultures were assessed for changes in metabolite and transcriptome profiles, H2O2resistance, and competence in sucrose containing biofilm media. Stationary phaseS. mutanssimulated microgravity cultures displayed increased killing by H2O2compared to normal gravity control cultures, but competence was not affected. RNA seq analysis revealed that expression of 153 genes was up regulated >=2 fold and 94 genes down regulated >=2 fold during simulated microgravity high aspect ratio vessel growth. These included a number of genes located on extrachromosomal elements, as well as genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, translation, and stress responses. Collectively, these results suggest that growth under microgravity analog conditions promotes changes inS. mutansgene expression and physiology that may translate to an altered cariogenic potential of this organism during space flight missions.",
    "methods": "S. mutansUA15962was used for all of the experiments described below. AllS. mutanscultures (including HARV vessels) were grown at 37 degreesC in a 5% CO2incubator. For each experiment,S. mutanswas freshly streaked from a frozen 30% (vol vol 1) glycerol stock onto Brain heart infusion (BHI) agar and grown for 48h. A single colony was then inoculated into 30ml BHI broth, and grown as a static culture for 16 18h prior to inoculation of HARVs. Disposable vessel rotary cell culture systems (Synthecon) with vertical and horizontal 4 station rotator bases were used to simulate microgravity (HARV rotated on axis perpendicular to gravitational vector) and \"normal\" (1xg) gravity (HARV rotated on axis parallel to gravitational vector), respectively (Supplemental FigureS4). All HARV manipulations were performed under a Class II A2 biosafety cabinet (Labconco). HARV vessels were filled with sterile media according to manufacturer's recommendations, and incubated at room temperature for 18h prior to each experiment. This media was then aseptically removed, and 20x diluteS. mutansovernight culture (approximate OD600=0.06/ml) in room temperature semi defined biofilm media (BM)43containing 11mM glucose and 10mM sucrose, was used to fill each HARV. Prior to HARV rotation and incubation, sterile 5 ml luer lock syringes were used to remove air bubbles according to manufacturer's protocols.\n\nFor each experiment (n=3 independent experiments per growth condition), overnightS. mutanscultures were used to inoculate 120ml of sterile BM containing 11mM glucose and 10mM sucrose. This inoculum was mixed well by vigorous swirling and vortexing, and 1ml withdrawn to measure the time of inoculation (t=0) CFU/ml. The remaining inoculum volume was then subjected again to vigorous swirling and vortexing and immediately used to fill 2x50ml disposable HARVs as described above. Each HARV was rotated either vertically (\"simulated microgravity\") or horizontally (\"normal gravity\") at 37 degreesC, 5% CO2for 24h. HARVs were rotated at 30 RPM for the first 8h of growth, and the rotation speed of each reactor was increased to 32 RPM after 8h of growth to ensure thatS. mutanscell aggregates did not settle to the bottom of the simulated microgravity HARV. At 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24h postinoculation, each HARV was removed from the incubator, vigorously agitated to remove adherent cell clumps from the walls and membrane of the HARV reactor and evenly dispersing cell clumps, and 1ml culture was immediately removed for CFU/ml assessment. The same volume of sterile media was then added back to each HARV and air bubbles removed as described above prior to re initiation of simulated microgravity or normal gravity HARV growth. For CFU/ml quantification, each 1ml sample was vortexed vigorously for at least 30s to resuspend cell clumps, followed immediately by serial dilution (each tube vortexed vigorously for at least 15s between each dilution) and CFU/ml determination using the track plating method.63\n\nOvernightS. mutanscultures were used to inoculate 500ml sterile BM containing 11mM glucose and 10mM sucrose to an approximate OD600=0.06/ml as described above. This inoculum was mixed well by vigorous swirling and vortexing, and 1ml was withdrawn to measure thet=0 OD600, pH, and CFU/ml. The remaining inoculum volume was then immediately used to fill 8x50ml disposable HARVs (inoculum volume was subjected to vigorous swirling and vortexing before addition to each HARV). For end point growth curve analysis att=4, 6, 8, and 12h (n=2 independent experiments total per time point per growth condition), four simulated microgravity and four normal gravity HARV cultures were grown in parallel at 37 degreesC, 5% CO2. HARVs were rotated at 30 RPM for the first 8h of growth, and the rotation speed of each reactor was increased to 32 RPM after 8h of growth to ensure thatS. mutanscell aggregates did not settle to the bottom of the simulated microgravity cultures. At each time point, one simulated microgravity and one normal gravity HARV were each harvested as follows: 25ml of HARV culture was transferred to a sterile 50ml Falcon tube. The HARV was then closed and shaken vigorously for approximately 5s (until there were no remaining visible clumps of bacteria stuck to the inside walls and membrane of the HARV). The reactor was then immediately uncapped and the remaining culture transferred to the 50ml Falcon tube, which was vortexed at high speed for 30s prior to removing 100ul for CFU counts. The tube was vortexed again for 10s, and 900ul immediately removed for measuring OD600and pH readings. OD600readings were obtained using a Genesys 10 Bio spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific), culture pH measured with colorpHast indicator strips (EMD), and CFU/ml calculated by serial dilution plating as described above. For the end point growth curve analysis att=24 andt=48h, a separate experiment (n=2 biological replicates for each time point) was performed as described above.\n\nOvernightS. mutanscultures were used to inoculate 350ml sterile BM containing 11mM glucose and 10mM sucrose to an approximate OD600=0.06/ml as described above. This inoculum was mixed well by vigorous swirling and vortexing, and 1ml was withdrawn to measure thet=0 OD600, pH, and CFU/ml. The remaining inoculum volume was then immediately used to fill 6x50ml disposable HARVs (inoculum volume was subjected to vigorous swirling and vortexing before addition to each HARV). A sterile media control was also collected at the beginning of each experiment and stored at  80 degreesC for metabolomics analysis (see below). For each experiment (n=3 independent experiments total), three simulated microgravity and three normal gravity HARV cultures were grown in parallel at 37 degreesC, 5% CO2as described above for the end point growth curve analysis. For each experiment, one simulated microgravity and one normal gravity HARV were each harvested att=4,t=8h, andt=24h growth, as described above for the end point growth curve analysis (for a total ofn=3 independent samples per time point per growth condition). HARVs were photographed prior to culture disruption and harvest to document macroscopic growth observations. After harvesting, 34ml of eacht=4, 8, and 24h HARV culture was centrifuged at 3000 RPM, 4 degreesC for 20min and immediately placed on ice. 1ml of culture supernatant was removed from each centrifuged sample, transferred to 1.5ml tubes, and immediately frozen at  80 degreesC. The remaining culture supernatants were decanted and cell pellets immediately frozen at  80 degreesC. For RNA seq samples (t=8h only), a 10 ml aliquot of each HARV culture was also centrifuged at 3000 RPM, 4 degreesC for 20min and immediately placed on ice. Culture supernatants were decanted and 1ml RNAlater (Ambion) was added to each cell pellet prior to immediate storage at  80 degreesC.\n\nExtraction of metabolites (n=3 independent biological samples per time point and growth condition) and all metabolomics analyses (including statistics) were performed by Metabolon, Inc. (Durham, NC) following previously published methods.64 68Details specific to this experiment can be found in Supplemental FileS1(Supplemental Materials and Methods).\n\nRNA was isolated fromt=8h cell pellets stored at  80 degreesC in RNAlater (collected fromn=3 independent experiments each for simulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures) with the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) and FASTPREP lysing matrix B tubes (MP Biomedical) using previously described methods.50,69Each RNA sample was then subjected to a second DNAse treatment using the TURBO DNA free Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) per the manufacturer's protocols. Lack of contaminating genomic DNA in each RNA sample was then determined using quantitative real time PCR (i.e. no cDNA synthesis step) andS. mutans specific primers (1547 F/R; Supplemental TableS3) prior to sending >=5ug of each RNA sample to Seqwright Genomic Services (Houston, TX), who performed all steps of the RNA seq workflow, data curation, differential expression, and corresponding statistical analysis. In brief, each RNA sample was subjected to an mRNA enrichment step and generation of a library of cDNA template molecules of known strand origin using the TruSeq Total mRNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina). Sequencing was performed using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform, generating 2x100bp read lengths for a total of 2x10M reads per sample. Illumina CASAVA software was used to create genomic builds and count reads, whereas TopHat 2.0.8b and Cufflinks 2.0.170were used to align reads to theS. mutansUA159 genome (Genbank accession #NC_004350.2).All RNA seq data have been deposited to NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus and are accessible through GEO Series accession numberGSE90166.\n\nFor each experiment (n=3 independent biological samples each for simulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures), twoS. mutans10 ml HARV cultures were inoculated as described above, and each was grown for either 4, 8, or 16h. For the 4 and 8h experiments, the HARV rotation speed was 30 RPM. For the 16h experiment, the HARV rotation speed was 30 RPM for the first 8h of growth, and was then increased to 35 RPM to counteract sedimentation of cellular aggregates.S. mutanscultures were then harvested from each HARV vessel, transferred to a 50ml Falcon tube, and centrifuged for 10min at 4000 RPM. Cell pellets were resuspended in 5ml sterile 1x Hanks Buffered Salt Solution (HBSS), and 100ul was withdrawn from each tube and subjected to serial dilution plating as described above to enumerate CFU/ml of each cell suspension at \"t=0\" (prior to H2O2addition). H2O2was added to each remaining 4.9ml cell suspension to a final concentration of 5mM, and incubated at 37 degreesC, 5% CO2. Samples of each cell suspension were removed at 15, 30, 45, 60, and 120min post H2O2addition to enumerate CFU/ml, and % survival for each sample was calculated by 100x (t=x CFU/ml/t=0CFU/ml).\n\nThe ability ofS. mutansto take up exogenous DNA was assessed in microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures based on previously described methods.50,71For each experiment (n=3 independent biological samples each for simulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures),S. mutans10 ml micro gravity and normal gravity HARV cultures were grown in BM containing 11mM glucose and 10mM sucrose for 90min [corresponding to 2.3x106CFU/ml (+/ 3.0x105SEM) for normal gravity and 3.1x106CFU/ml (+/ 1.5x105SEM) for simulated microgravity] at 30 RPM. HARVS were removed from rotator bases and 2ug of unmethylated pOri23 plasmid DNA was added to each reactor. Microgravity and normal gravity HARVs were then incubated for 2.5h at 30 RPM prior to serial dilution and plating of each culture on BHI agar +/ 10ug/ml erythromycin (Erm; selectable antibiotic for pOri23). CFU/ml were determined after 48h plate growth, and transformation efficiencies were calculated as the percentage of transformants (BHI Erm10CFU/ml) among the total viable cells (BHI CFU/ml). For each experiment, a non rotating control culture (15 ml Falcon tube containing 15ml ofS. mutansculture) was grown in parallel and assessed for competence as described above.\n\nThe DAVID Bioinformatics Resource22,23was used to aid in functional categorization of the RNA seq differential expression data and to perform functional annotation clustering. Only genes with statistically significant log2 fold changes of at least +/ 1.0 were included in these analyses. The lowest classification stringency was used for functional categorization. For functional annotation clustering analysis, the default analysis parameters were used: Medium classification stringency, similarity threshold=0.5, enrichment threshold (EASE score)=1.0. As recommended previously,22an enrichment score cutoff of >=1.3 was applied to the functional annotation clustering analysis. For identifying trends in metabolic pathway changes, all statistically significant RNA seq differential expression data with a log2 fold change of at least +/ 0.6 were also analyzed using Metacyc.24\n\nFor metabolomics, statistical analyses were performed in ArrayStudio on log transformed data. For those analyses not standard in ArrayStudio, the programs R (http://cran.r project.org/) or JMP (SAS,http://www.jmp.com) were used as previously described.72Two way ANOVA was used to compare the effects of treatment (simulated microgravity vs. normal gravity growth) and growth time (t=4, 8, and 24h) on metabolite differences. Multiple comparisons were accounted for with the false discovery rate (FDR) method, and each FDR was estimated byq values. PCA was also applied to the metabolomics data. For RNA seq, differential expression analysis was performed by Seqwright Genomic Services using FPKM (fragments per kilobase per million mapped reads) values and fold change was expressed as log2(FPKM normal gravity/FPKM simulated microgravity). For all other data, statistical analyses were performed using Sigmaplot version 12.5 (Build 12.5.0.38, Systat Software, Inc.). Data was tested for normality and equal variance, followed by aT test or Rank sum test, as appropriate.",
    "results": "To probe the effect of simulated microgravity growth onS. mutans, continuous growth curves (whereby cell samples were removed from the same HARV at different time points) were performed (n=3 independent experiments each) in biofilm media (BM) containing 11mM glucose and 10mM sucrose over a 24h period. In this analysis, no statistically significant differences in CFU/ml at each time point were observed (Supplemental Fig.S1). An initial decrease in CFU/ml was observed in both the simulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures betweent=0 (time of inoculation) andt=2h growth, which was likely a function of sucrose dependent cell aggregation. Very small differences in cell viability patterns in early stationary phase (6 8h growth) suggest that the simulated microgravity HARV culture may have entered stationary phase slightly sooner than the normal gravity HARV culture in this experiment. As well, the simulated microgravity culture persisted in stationary phase until approximately 12h growth, followed by a somewhat rapid death phase, with a 1 log loss of viability between 12 and 24h growth. In contrast, the viability of normal gravity culture underwent a more gradual decrease in cell viability between 12 and 24h of growth.\n\nMonitoring of cell growth by CFU/ml in the continuous growth curve experiments described above required constant disruption of the HARV cultures, making it difficult to assess potential macroscopic differences in cell aggregation in the simulated microgravity and normal gravity conditions. Therefore, these growth curves were also performed using an \"end point\" approach, whereby simulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures (n=2 independent experiments per time point per growth condition) were grown undisturbed in replicate HARV vessels fort=4, 6, 8, 12, 24, and 48h (Fig.1). Using this end point approach, no significant differences in CFU/ml were observed between the simulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures at the assessed time points (Fig.1), and the initial drop in CFU/ml observed early in the growth curves of the continuous cultures (Supplemental Fig.S1) was not observed in these end point cultures. As well, both the simulated microgravity and normal gravity cultures underwent the same pattern of growth when monitored with this end point approach: Log phase growth occurred between 0 and 6h, and both cultures were in early stationary phase at 8h growth, followed by entry into late stationary phase/death phase between 24 and 48h growth. Interestingly, differences in macroscopic cell aggregation were consistently observed between the simulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV conditions when using the end point growth analysis. Specifically, the simulated microgravity condition tended to form round/compact cellular structures, whereas the aggregates in the normal gravity growth condition tended to form less compact structures (Fig.2).\n\nEnd point growth curve analysis ofS. mutanssimulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures. Simulated microgravity (dark gray bars) and normal gravity (light gray bars) HARV end point growth was measured by serial dilution and CFU/ml plating att=0 (time of inoculation; average ofn=4 independent experiments), andt=4, 6, 8, 12, 24, and 48h postinoculation (average ofn=2 independent experiments per time point per growth condition), as described in \"Materials and methods\". Thevertical dotted lineon the graph indicates that thet=24 and 48h data were obtained in a separate experimental run from thet=4, 6, 8, and 12h time points.Error bars=standard error of the mean (SEM)\n\nRepresentativeS. mutansend point HARV cultures grown for 8h in biofilm media under simulated microgravity (a) and normal gravity (b) conditions. Note the structural differences of the self aggregating bacterial cells under each condition (indicated byarrows)\n\nTo monitor potential differences in the metabolome of simulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures, cell pellets and culture supernatants were harvested from a second end point HARV culture experiment (n=3 independent experiments per time point per growth condition) att=4,t=8, andt=24h samples, corresponding to log phase, early stationary phase, and late stationary/death phase, respectively(Supplemental Fig.S2). Given that macroscopic differences in the self aggregating clusters ofS. mutanscells were consistently observed at thet=8h time point (Fig.2), RNA seq analysis was also performed on thet=8h samples. Principle component analysis (PCA) of metabolomics data generated fromt=4, 8, and 24h HARV cultures (Supplemental FilesS2andS3) revealed a strong relationship between the time of growth (t=4, 8, and 24h) and metabolite profile for each of the simulated microgravity and normal gravity cultures (Fig.3). However, a much weaker \"time treatment\" relationship existed when comparing the metabolite profile between simulated microgravity vs. normal gravity cultures at each time point. Welch's two samplettests revealed 8, 14, and 10 statistically significant differences (p<=0.05) in cellular metabolite production between cells grown under normal gravity and microgravity conditions at the 4, 8, and 24h time points, respectively (Supplemental FileS2). Likewise, 21, 21, and 23 statistically significant differences were observed between the corresponding culture supernatant samples at these time points (Supplemental FileS3). Keeping in mind the caveat that the number of significant differences at each time point were close to that expected by random chance alone (5% error rate), the significant changes of cell associated and supernatant metabolites of the 8h HARV cultures are summarized in Table1, and their potential relationship to the corresponding 8h RNA seq data are discussed below.\n\nPrinciple component analysis (PCA) of cellular (a) and supernatant (b) metabolites. Values onXandYaxis labels=% of the total eigen values\n\nList of cellular and supernatant metabolites that displayed a significant (p<0.05) time/growth condition interaction att=8h HARV growth\n\nBecause macroscopic structural differences between theS. mutanssimulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures were consistently observed at 8h growth (early stationary phase), we chose to perform RNA seq analysis onn=3 independent biological samples per growth condition (simulated microgravity and normal gravity) isolated from this time point. Compared to the metabolomics data, differential expression analysis of the 8h RNA seq data revealed a large number of statistically significant gene expression changes in normal gravity relative to simulated microgravity growth (Supplemental FileS4). Specifically, 94 genes were up regulated (log2fold change >=1.0) and 153 genes were down regulated (log2fold change <= 1.0) in normal gravity cultures relative to simulated microgravity cultures. These patterns in gene expression were confirmed by qPCR for a subset of genes (Supplemental TableS1). Functional classification (Fig.4) revealed that expression of a large number of genes associated with transposon sequences, as well as several genes encoding predicted phage proteins, were down regulated in normal gravity cultures relative to simulated microgravity growth. A second trend of interest was the significant down regulated expression of genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, including various phosphotransferase (PTS) systems, the carbon catabolite protein regulatorccpA, and the redox sensitive transcriptional regulatorrex, in the 8h normal gravity cultures relative to the simulated microgravity cultures (Fig.4and Supplemental FileS4). Increased expression of genes encoding ribosomal proteins, tRNAs and other aspects of protein translation was also observed in the normal gravity cultures compared to simulated microgravity growth, whereas expression of a large number of genes encoding transcriptional regulators was decreased in the normal gravity cultures (Fig.4). As well, altered expression of stress genes was also observed in the normal gravity HARV cultures, including decreased expression of the toxin antitoxin (TA) systemsmazEF(SMU_172/173) andrelBE(SMU_895/896), decreased expression of the holin likelrgA, decreased expression of the peroxide resistance genedpr, and increased expression of genes encoding glutathione S transferase (SMU_1296) and glutaredoxin (SMU_669c) (Fig.4).\n\nDistribution of gene functional categories differentially expressed during normal gravity growth relative to simulated microgravity. RNA isolated from 8h normal gravity and simulated microgravityS. mutansHARV cultures (n=3 independent experiments per growth condition) was subjected to RNA seq transcriptome profiling as described in \"Materials and methods\". Differential expression and statistical analysis was carried out using a cutoff FDR adjustedpvalue of 0.05. Of this dataset, those genes with a log2(fold change) value of at least +/ 1.0 were grouped by functional classification based on DAVID gene functional categorization analysis, NCBI gene annotations and KEGG pathway analysis. Total number of up regulated genes (log2fold change >=1.0,black bars)=94, total number of down regulated genes (log2fold change <=  1.0,gray bars)=153\n\nDAVID bioinformatics resource22,23was used to further probe the RNA seq dataset for functional annotation groups that were enriched in the genes that displayed a log2fold change expression of at least +/ 1.0 in the normal gravity vs. simulated microgravity HARV cultures (Supplemental TableS2). This analysis revealed the presence of four significant (enrichment scores >=1.3) functional annotation clusters in the down regulated normal gravity genes, which included genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism and transport (cluster I), transcriptional regulators (clusters II and III), and carbohydrate transporters/other membrane proteins (cluster IV). As well, functional annotation clusters involved in arginine metabolism (cluster V) and nucleoside/tRNA metabolism (cluster VI) were significantly enriched (enrichment scores >=1.3) in the up regulated normal gravity genes. To identify metabolic pathways potentially altered under the simulated microgravity growth condition, all statistically significant changes in 8h growth gene expression from the RNA seq differential expression analysis with a minimum log2fold change of at least +/ 0.6 were also analyzed using the bioinformatics program Metacyc.24. The top metabolic pathways identified by this analysis were mixed acid fermentation (seven genes), arginine biosynthesis (six genes), and pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotide biosynthesis (five genes) (Supplemental Fig.S3). Specifically, genes involved in the conversion of acetyl CoA to 2 oxoglutarate (a TCA cycle intermediate), arginine biosynthesis, and dCDP/dTMP biosynthesis were upregulated in the normal gravity HARV cultures, whereas genes involved in ethanol and acetate fermentation were down regulated in normal gravity HARV cultures. Interestingly, when comparing these metabolic pathways to statistically significant changes in cellular metabolites at 8h growth (Table1), several matched to the corresponding metabolic pathway changes (Supplemental Fig.S3) identified in the RNA seq data by Metacyc, including 2 oxogluarate (alpha ketoglutarate; mixed acid fermentation), pyruvate (mixed acid fermentation), argininosuccinate (arginine biosynthesis), uridine monophosphate and uracil (pyrmidine deoxynucleotide de novo biosynthesis). The apparent increased sensitivity of the RNA seq data in detecting more changes inS. mutansmetabolism relative to the corresponding metabolomics data may reflect a suboptimal component of the metabolomics sample collection method and/or processing time.\n\nS. mutansencounters significant oxidative stress in the oral cavity in the form of H2O2production by competing non cariogenic oral streptococci,25,26as well as from dental care products (toothpastes, mouthwash) that contain H2O2. Furthermore, expression of several oxidative stress related genes (dpr,rex,SMU_1296, SMU_669c) was altered in the 8h simulated microgravity HARV cultures. Therefore, the ability ofS. mutansto survive exogenous H2O2treatment was compared in cells isolated from exponential (t=4), early stationary (t=8) and late stationary (t=16) simulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures (Fig.5). Although no significant differences in oxidative stress resistance were observed between normal gravity and simulated microgravity cells isolated from 4 and 8h growth, the H2O2 treated 4h cells (Fig.5a) displayed a greater overall loss of viability (~1% survival after 90min of treatment) compared to the 8h cells (Fig.5b; ~50% survival after 90min of treatment). Interestingly, when this experiment was repeated on cells from normal gravity and simulated microgravity cultures harvested at 16h growth (Fig.5c), the simulated microgravity cells displayed significantly (P<0.05, one tailedTtest) increased H2O2killing (~22% survival after 60min treatment) compared to the normal gravity cells (~43% survival after 60min treatment).\n\nPercent survival ofS. mutanspost treatment with 5mM H2O2. Cells fromt=4 (a),t=8 (b), ort=16 (c) hour simulated microgravity (triangles) and normal gravity (circles) HARV cultures (n=3 independent experiments per time point per growth condition) were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in sterile HBSS. Samples were withdrawn to determine initial CFU/ml (\"t=0\"), and then H2O2was added to a final concentration of 5mM. CFU/ml of each cell suspension was sampled at 20, 40, 60, 90, and 120min post H2O2addition, and CFU/ml were determined. % Survival was calculated by 100x[(t=final CFU/ml)/(t=0CFU/ml)].Error bars=SEM.Asteriskdenotes statistical significance, one tailedttest (p<0.05)\n\nBecause previousS. mutansstudies have implicated a complex link between oxidative stress, biofilm formation, and natural competence [reviewed in27], we were curious if competence was also subject to regulation by the low shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) environment. Therefore early exponential phase (growth phase at whichS. mutansis most competent during standard in vitro growth) simulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures were tested for their ability to uptake plasmid DNA. However, transformation efficiency (as measured by uptake of a plasmid conferring erythromycin resistance) was nearly identical between simulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures (Fig.6). The transformation efficiency was also not affected by HARV growth itself, as the HARV transformation efficiencies were similar to those measured in a parallel non rotating culture ofS. mutans(Fig.6).\n\nS. mutanscompetence phenotype assessed in simulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures. Simulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures, as well as a parallel static Falcon tube control culture, were each grown for 1.5h in biofilm media prior to addition of 2ug pOri23 plasmid DNA. All three cultures were then grown for 2.5 more hours followed by harvest and serial dilution plating on BHI agar+/ 10ug/ml erythromycin (selective antibiotic to monitor plasmid transformation). Transformation efficiency was calculated as the percentage of transformants (CFU/ml on BHI+erythromycin) among total viable cells (CFU/ml on BHI).Datarepresent the average ofn=3 independent experiments.Error bars=SEM",
    "discussion": "Although the effects of both spaceflight and microgravity analog growth on virulence related phenotypes of bacterial pathogens such asSalmonella entericaserovar Typhimurium,Escherichia coli,Pseudomonas aeruginosa, andStaphylococcus aureushave been well described,28 38comparatively little research has been dedicated to studying the specific effects of space flight and simulated microgravity on virulence attributes of oral bacteria such asS. mutans. In the Skylab missions conducted in the 1970s, the effects of space flight and diet on the oral cavity and oral microbiota of astronauts were documented using culture dependent methods. These studies demonstrated that increased counts of specific oral bacteria (i.e.Bacteriodes,Veillonella,Fusobacterium,Neisseria,S. sanguinus, andS. mutans) were recovered from the astronauts in response to space flight.16Furthermore, the astronauts in these studies exhibited decreased salivary lysozyme and increased dental calculus and gingival inflammation.16More recently, the effect of simulated microgravity on the physiology and biofilm structure ofS. mutanswas also assessed using a superconducting magnet capable of generating a large gradient high magnetic field (LG HMF),39which mimics the space like gravity environment by achieving stable levitation of diamagnetic materials such as biological cells and tissues.40The results of this study suggested that growth ofS. mutansunder simulated microgravity enhanced its acid tolerance, altered its biofilm architecture, and increased its proportion within dual species biofilms co cultured withS. sanguinis, an H2O2 producing early colonizer of dental plaque biofilm.39Collectively, these previous studies suggest that both space flight and the microgravity analog environment have the ability to alter the cariogenic potential ofS. mutans.\n\nIn our current work, HARVs rotated on an axis perpendicular to the Earth's gravitational vector were used to simulate a low shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) growth environment. This ground based model of microgravity has been used to study the response of a variety of microorganisms to \"weightlessness\" that would be encountered during space flight [reviewed in19,41,42]. However, it is important to keep in mind that theS. mutansLSMMG associated metabolic and physiological changes (i.e. alterations in cell aggregation, transcriptome, and sensitivity to oxidative stress) presented here could represent the bacteria's response to either simulated microgravity and/or low fluid shear (<1dyn/cm2) specific environmental signals, the latter of which may be relevant to the fluid shear of saliva flow (<0.8dyn/cm2) experienced byS. mutansin the oral cavity.19,21Therefore, the data obtained in this study have the potential to shed light onS. mutansphysiology and virulence properties relevant to environmental signals experienced in the host, and will hopefully provide a springboard for planning future space flight studies of oral bacteria. It is also important to note that all of theS. mutansexperiments presented in this study were conducted in semi defined culture medium containing 11mM glucose and 10mM sucrose, previously shown to promote in vitroS. mutansbiofilm formation.43The addition of sucrose, a host dietary sugar to whichS. mutansis exposed to in the oral cavity, promotes production of extracellular glucan polymers byS. mutans, important biofilm matrix components that promote intracellular adhesion.7In reality, the in vivo plaque biofilm environment ofS. mutansis much more complex, including stress conditions such as interspecies competition for nutrients and space within the biofilm, as well as alternating periods of \"feast and famine\" with respect to dietary carbohydrate consumption. Therefore, the growth condition used in this study should be considered a simple representation of caries promoting \"feast\" conditions experienced byS. mutansin the oral cavity. With these caveats in mind, the following discussion points represent interesting patterns/conclusions from the data obtained in this study:\n\n1.S. mutansdisplays an altered early stationary phase metabolism under simulated microgravity conditions: As indicated in the \"Results\" section and Fig.1,S. mutans\"end point\" simulated microgravity and normal gravity cultures appear to enter stationary phase at the same point in growth (6h) compared to normal gravity cultures, and there were no apparent differences in CFU/ml of each culture at each time point. This being said, the 8h (early stationary phase) metabolomics and RNA seq data suggest thatS. mutanssimulated microgravity metabolism at this point is altered relative to normal gravity growth. For example, simulated microgravity cultures experienced a ten fold decrease in supernatant glucose levels (Table1and Supplemental FileS3) at 8h growth relative to the normal gravity cultures. Furthermore, expression of PTS system genes involved in transport of carbohydrates (glucose, mannitol, trehalose, mannose and cellobiose) was significantly upregulated during simulated microgravity growth, whereas expression of genes encoding ribosomal proteins, tRNAs, and other aspects of protein translation was decreased in the microgravity cultures at this time point (Fig.4and Supplemental FileS4). Bioinformatics analysis also revealed patterns of decreased arginine metabolism and decreased pyrimidine biosynthesis (Supplemental TableS2and Supplemental Fig.S3) in the 8h simulated microgravity cultures. Finally, expression of genes encoding the central metabolic transcriptional regulators CcpA and Rex were also both upregulated (2.2 fold and 2.8 fold, respectively) at 8h growth in the simulated microgravity cultures. CcpA has been shown to regulateS. mutanscatabolite repression and the ability to utilize non preferred carbohydrates, acid tolerance, acid production, and biofilm formation,44 46whereas Rex regulates expression ofS. mutansgenes involved with carbohydrate fermentation, biofilm formation, and oxidative stress resistance in response to cellular redox.47,48Interestingly, a role for Rex in the transcriptional response ofStaphylococcus aureusto LSMMG was also previously implicated by the altered expression of a number of Rex regulated genes under this growth condition.29Although great care was taken in each experiment to vigorously vortex all samples prior to and during serial dilution plating, we cannot exclude the possibility that sucrose dependent cell clumping may have masked more apparent growth differences between the simulated microgravity and normal gravity end point HARV cultures in these studies.\n\n2.S. mutanslate stationary phase simulated microgravity cultures appear to be subject to increased stress: A striking phenotypic property observed inS. mutanssimulated microgravity cultures was the greatly increased sensitivity of cells from late stationary phase (16h) to H2O2treatment (Fig.5c) relative to cells from normal gravity cultures. However, no apparent differences in oxidative stress resistance were observed between the simulated microgravity and normal gravity cells harvested at earlier time points (log phase and early stationary phase, Fig.5a, b, respectively). This result correlated with the LG HMFS. mutansmicrogravity study by Cheng and co workers,39which found that mid exponential phaseS. mutansmicrogravity and normal gravity cells did not differ in their sensitivity to H2O2. In previous studies, late stationary phase (20 24h) cultures ofS. typhimuriumandP. aeruginosawere both shown to be more resistant to oxidative stress when grown in simulated microgravity,30,49whereasS. typhimuriumsimulated microgravity cultures grown to an earlier phase of growth (10h) displayed increased sensitivity to H2O2treatment.31Furthermore, the sensitivity of stationary phase simulated microgravity cultures of adherent invasiveE. colito oxidative stress was shown to be strain dependent.33The susceptibility ofS. aureusto oxidative stress when grown in LSMMG has also been previously investigated: compared to normal gravity growth,S. aureuscells isolated from simulated microgravity cultures displayed increased sensitivity to challenge with H2O2, which was demonstrated to be related to decreased carotenoid (yellow membrane pigment) production under this growth condition.29These previously published studies, in conjunction with theS. mutansresults presented here, clearly demonstrate that the microgravity model used, growth phase at which oxidative stress is tested, and/or other inherent species and strain dependent differences, make it difficult to discern broad conclusions regarding the effect of the LSMMG on oxidative stress resistance.\n\nAlthough direct comparisons cannot be extrapolated due to time point differences between the 8h RNA seq data (Fig.4and Supplemental FileS4) and 16h oxidative stress data (Fig.5c), it is interesting to note that the 8h simulated microgravity cultures displayed increased expression of genes previously shown to be involved in the response to oxidative stress inS. mutans. These includedlrgA, which encodes a predicted holin like protein,50,51dpr, encoding an iron binding protein that reduces the intracellular free iron pool during oxidative stress,52,53andrex.48As well,S. mutanssimulated microgravity cultures displayed increased expression of genes encoding phosphotransacetylase (Pta; SMU_1043c) and two putative acetate kinase (Act) genes (ackAand SMU_1299c), involved in the conversion of acetyl CoA to acetyl phosphate and acetyl phosphate to acetate, respectively.54InS. mutans, aspects of the Pta Ack pathway have been shown to influence the cellular response to oxidative stress resistance.54These results suggest that the simulated microgravity HARV cultures may be experiencing an oxidative like stress response in early stationary phase (8h growth), and the altered expression of these oxidative stress related genes and metabolic pathways is perhaps occurring in response to this stress. Further support for the idea that theS. mutanssimulated microgravity cultures may be experiencing more inherent stress relative to the normal gravity cultures stems from the observation that TA system genesmazEFandrelBEwere significantly upregulated during simulated microgravity growth (Fig.4and Supplemental FileS4). MazF and RelE have been shown in several bacteria to selectively inhibit translation by cleaving specific mRNA recognition sequences in response to nutritional stress [reviewed in55,56]. These data collectively suggest thatS. mutanssimulated microgravity HARV cultures display characteristics associated with stationary phase cellular stress. However, it is not clear from this data whether these cultures are experiencing overlapping simultaneous stresses (such as oxidative and starvation stress), or if the sum of these phenotype and gene expression changes represent a stress response specific to LSMMG.\n\n3.S. mutansdisplays an altered cell aggregation phenotype under simulated microgravity conditions: Micro organisms such asMicrococcus luteus,57E. coli,58P. aeruginosa,34,35,59S. aureus,29S. typhimurium,36andCandida albicans60,61have all displayed increased biofilm growth when grown in either ground based simulated and/or space flight microgravity conditions. In some instances, this biofilm increase was paralleled by documented increases in expression of biofilm promoting regulatory genes or adhesion factors.29,34 36,49,58,61Given these observations in other micro organisms, we predicted thatS. mutanswould also display an increase in biofilm formation when grown in HARV microgravity cultures. Although biofilms attached to a solid surface were not assessed in these studies, macroscopic differences in cell cell aggregation were typically observed in simulated microgravity compared to normal gravity HARV cultures at stationary phase (8h growth; Fig.2), suggesting that cell cell adhesion and/or biofilm like properties of this bacterium were altered in response to simulated microgravity growth. Although cell aggregation was observed in both the normal gravity and simulated microgravity HARV cultures grown in biofilm promoting media containing sucrose, the simulated microgravity cell aggregates were more compact and more difficult to disrupt relative to the aggregates formed during normal gravity growth. Follow up studies will be required to better characterize the structural properties of these cell aggregates (i.e. production of sucrose dependent exopolysaccharide) and whether they are actually similar to biofilms that form on hydroxyapatite in vitro and/or the tooth surface in vivo. However, it is noteworthy that altered cell aggregation and/or \"attachment independent\" phenotypes have also been observed in other biofilm forming microbes in both LSMMG29,34and during spaceflight.61\n\nIn summary, the results from our experiments suggest thatS. mutansundergoes changes in metabolism, physiology, and global gene expression during stationary phase simulated microgravity growth that impact cell aggregation and oxidative stress resistance. Defining the exact regulatory circuits and contributions of these differentially regulated genes to the ability ofS. mutansto survive and adapt to LSMMG and spaceflight environments will help in the development of treatment and control strategies to combat the caries potential of this pathogen. Furthermore, these studies may provide insight into the response ofS. mutansto low fluid shear encountered in the oral cavity. Our future research efforts will focus on assessingS. mutansbiofilm formation during simulated microgravity growth using culture conditions more closely mimicking the oral cavity (i.e., artificial saliva media and periodic pulsing of sucrose addition), as well as growth ofS. mutansas part of a mixed species biofilm consortium.",
