    "abstract": "Maintaining the proximity of centrosomes to nuclei is important in several cellular contexts, and LINC complexes formed by SUN and KASH proteins are crucial in this process. Here, we characterize the presumedDrosophilaortholog of the mammalian SUN protein, sperm associated antigen 4 (Spag4, previously named Giacomo), and demonstrate that Spag4 is required for centriole and nuclear attachment during spermatogenesis. Production ofspag4mRNA is limited to the testis, and Spag4 protein shows a dynamic pattern of association with the germline nuclei, including a concentration of protein at the site of attachment of the single spermatid centriole. In the absence of Spag4, nuclei and centrioles or basal bodies (BBs) dissociate from each other after meiosis. This role of Spag4 in centriolar attachment does not involve either of the two KASH proteins of theDrosophilagenome (Klarsicht and MSP 300), but does require the coiled coil protein Yuri Gagarin. Yuri shows an identical pattern of localization at the nuclear surface to Spag4 during spermatogenesis, and epistasis studies show that the activities of Yuri and dynein dynactin are downstream ofspag4in this centriole attachment pathway. The later defects in spermatogenesis seen foryuriandspag4mutants are similar, suggesting they could be secondary to initial disruption of events at the nuclear surface.\n\nKeywords:KASH protein, SUN protein, Centrosome, Centriole, Coiled coil proteins, Sperm basal body, Spermatogenesis",
    "methods": "Transgenic lines were prepared by standard methods at UT Austin or at Genetic Services (Sudbury, MA). Standard genetic crosses were used to introduce: (1) transgenespC4 spag4, pC4 spag4:gfp, pC4 spag4:6xmyc, pC4 spag4 SUNstopandp50:GFPinto the background ofspag4 knockout allele #6 and (2)pC4 spag4:6xmycandp50:GFPinto theyuriF64background.p50:GFPandDlc90Fe155/TMB Tbwere obtained from Thomas Hays, University of Minnesota, MN, USA.w,alphaTub:gfp, w, yfp:asllines (Rebollo et al., 2004;Varmark et al., 2007) and the deficiency spanningspag4 Df(2L)Prl, were obtained from Cayetano Gonzalez, Institute for Research and Biomedicine, Barcelona, Spain and theDrosophilaStock Center (Bloomington), respectively.\n\nMolecular biology manipulations were performed using standard techniques. Unless specified, SuperScript II RT reagents and Platinum PCR Supermix (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were used, and primers from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Primer sequences are provided in supplementary material Fig. S2. DNA sequencing was performed at the UT Austin ICMB Core Facility.\n\nTotal RNA from ten male or female larvae, pupae and adults was isolated and treated with DNase I, as described (Kracklauer et al., 2007). RT was performed using an oligo (dT) primer followed by PCR with primers P1 and P2.\n\nRT PCR was carried out using male pupal total RNA isolated as recommended in the FirstChoice RLM RACE kit protocol (Ambion, Austin, TX), and then used in 5 RLM RACE and 3 RACE. The 5 end of the gene was amplified using the RNA adapter specific forward outer and inner primers, and the gene specific reverse primer P3. To amplify the 3 end of the gene, anchored oligo (dT) adapter primers from the FirstChoice kit were used in RT. In the PCR, the gene specific forward primer P4 and the 3 adapter specific outer primer were used. 5 and 3 RACE products were subcloned into pGEM T Easy (Promega, Madison, WI) and their sequences verified. A completespag4cDNA with 5 and 3 UTRs was generated by PCR using a mixture of partially overlapping RACE products as template and the 5 and 3 adapter specific primers. The final PCR product was subcloned into pGEM T Easy, sequenced and catalogued asEF537040at NCBI.\n\nThe transgenepC4 spag4was generated by ligating thespag4coding region as a 4.9 kbPstI fragment fromBACR02J20into thePstI site ofpCaSpEr 4(pC4) (Thummel and Pirrotta, 1992). The GFP tagged version,pC4 spag4:gfp,was generated by ligating the GFP ORF frompUAST gfp(Kracklauer et al., 2007) immediately downstream of thespag4coding region inpC4 spag4. For this purpose, anAscI site was introduced immediately upstream of thespag4stop codon using the QuikChange II PCR Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) and primer pair P13 P14. The GFP ORF withAscI sites on both ends (generated by PCR using primers P11 P12 on thepUAST gfptemplate) was then cloned into thisAscI site. To generatepC4 spag4:6xmyc, a6xmycORF was amplified from thepUAST 6xmycvector (Kracklauer et al., 2007) using the PCR primers P15 and P16, and the ORF was then cloned into theAscI site as forpC4 spag4:GFP. To generatepC4 spag4SUNstop, a stop codon was introduced into the 4.9 kbPstI fragment using the mutagenic primers P21 P22, and the resulting mutated fragment was cloned into thePstI site ofpC4as described above.\n\nThe targeting construct (pW35 spag4HRKO) was generated as follows. DNA sequences of ~3 kb (upstream) and ~5 kb (downstream) flanking thespag4coding region were amplified by PCR using hot start Herculase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), primer sets P5 P6 and P7 P8, andBAC02J20(Open Biosystems, Huntsville, AL) as template. PCR products were subcloned into pGEM T Easy and their sequences verified. The upstream 3 kb fragment was excised from pGEM T Easy withNotI and cloned into that site ofpW35(Gong and Golic, 2003). The downstream 5 kb fragment was excised from pGEM T Easy withBamHI andAvrII, then cloned into those sites inpW35downstream of thew+marker gene, resulting inpW35 spag4HRKO. After generation of transgenic lines, a cross of 500y w, pW35 spag4HRKO/FM7c, gfpvirgin females with 500(y) w;; [hs FLP],[hs I SceI]/TM3, Sbmales was set up with subsequent embryo manipulation and heat shocks, as described previously (Kracklauer et al., 2007). ~400 crosses of 3 4w+ mosaic(y) w, pW35 spag4HRKO/+;; [hs FLP],[hs I SceI]/+ F1 virgin females and 3 4w; hs FLPmales were performed. F2 progeny were screened for a single male from each cross with solidw+eyes, indicative of targeted insertion events. Insertions were mapped for 100 independent F2 candidate knockout males using standard methods; for 87 candidates, the insertion mapped to chromosome 2 as expected. For ~50 such stocks,spag4targeting was assessed by Southern blotting (Kracklauer et al., 2007). Ultimately, five independentspag4knockout alleles   1, 6, 11, 12 and 15   were isolated. Allele 6 was used for most studies.\n\nTwenty individualspag4homozygousor spag4/Df(2L)Prlmales were each crossed to twow1118virgins. As a control, 20 crosses usingw1118males homozygous for a wild type (Oregon R) copy of chromosome 2 (w1118;ORC2iso) were set up. For the fertility rescue assays, 20 individualspag4homozygous males bearing a single copy of the transgenepC4 spag4,pC4 spag4:gfp,pC4 spag4:6xmycorpC4 spag4 SUNstopwere used. To assay female fertility, 20 virginspag4homozygous orspag4/Df(2L)Prlfemales were assayed individually with twow1118males. Similar crosses withw1118; ORC2isovirgin females were set up in parallel as wild type controls. After 1 week, average combined numbers of larvae and pupae per vial were determined.\n\nTestes were fixed on ice for 2 hours in PBS with 2% glutaraldehyde [Electron Microscopy Sciences (EMS), Hatfield, PA], rinsed, then post fixed at room temperature for 2 hours in 2% OsO4(EMS) and 0.8% K3[Fe(CN)6] in 1x symcollidine buffer (McDonald, 1984;Jinguji and Ishikawa, 1990). Tissues were then dehydrated and embedded in resin using standard procedures. 50 60 nm sections were cut, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined with a Philips EM208 electron microscope.\n\nTestes were fixed and stained essentially as described (Lin et al., 1996;Zhong and Belote, 2007;Texada et al., 2008), and mounted in VectaShield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) or 50% glycerol. Primary antibody dilutions were as follows: mouse anti MYC, 1:2000; rabbit anti MYC, 1:200; rabbit anti CM1, 1:100 (all from Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA); rabbit anti Vasa, 1:200 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); mouse anti gamma tubulin, 1:500 (Sigma) and chicken anti Yuri, 1:400 (Texada et al., 2008). Secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor 488 anti rabbit, Alexa Fluor 555 or Alexa Fluor 568 anti mouse and Alexa Fluor 488 anti chicken, all at 1:500 (Invitrogen). Alexa Fluor phalloidin (Invitrogen) to stain F actin and TOPRO 3 to stain DNA, were mixed into secondary antibody solutions at 15 ul phalloidin/ml and 1 ul/ml TOPRO 3. DAPI for DNA staining was added to mounting solution at 1 ul/ml. Testes were imaged with Leica AOBS SP2 and Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscopes and a Zeiss Axioplan microscope using Metamorph deconvolution software. Adobe Photoshop was used to process all images.\n\nISH was carried out essentially as described (White Cooper et al., 1998), using an 820 bp PCR product from thespag4ORF to generate sense and antisense probes by in vitro transcription with a DIG RNA Labeling Kit (Roche).",
    "results": "We first analyzed the expression ofspag4mRNA by RT PCR, and observed that spliced mRNA is found only in male larvae, pupae and adults (Fig. 1A), suggesting testis specific expression. Expression ofspag4mRNA characterized atwww.flyatlas.orgconfirms this testis specificity. In situ hybridization demonstrated thatspag4mRNA expression peaks in the early primary spermatocyte region of adult testes (Fig. 1B). Low levels of the unspliced precursor transcript were observed in females (Fig. 1A), but appear to be functionless given the viability and fertility ofspag4 null females (see below).\n\nspag4expression,spag4knockout and fertility assays.(A)spag4mRNA (~800bp) is limited to males, but low levels of the primary transcript (~1000 bp) are present in male and female pupae and adults.

Blue bars, males; pink bars, females.\n\nAlthough all SUN proteins described to date have a transmembrane (TM) domain N terminal to the SUN domain (Hagan and Yanagida, 1995;Malone et al., 1999;Shao et al., 1999;Dreger et al., 2001;Malone et al., 2003;Hodzic et al., 2004;Kracklauer et al., 2007;Liu et al., 2007), the originally annotated Spag4 protein sequence contains no TM domain (Tweedie et al., 2009). Using 5 RNA ligase mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RLM RACE), we identified 5spag4mRNA sequences encoding an N terminus with a single TM helix (Fig. 1C). 3 RACE also revealed a previously uncharacterized 3 UTR. The correctedspag4gene region spans ~1.2 kb of genomic DNA (Fig. 1C).\n\nTo determine the function ofspag4, we generated knockout mutations by ends out homologous recombination (Fig. 1D,E, and Materials and Methods). Homozygous mutant individuals developed normally, yielding adults that were wild type in appearance. However, mutant males [either homozygous or intransto deficiencyDf(2L)Prl] were completely sterile (Fig. 1F).spag4 null males courted, mounted and copulated with females (data not shown), suggesting that male sterility is not a behavioral defect. Mutant females were fertile, consistent with a lack ofspag4mRNA splicing in females. Male fertility was restored tospag4mutants by introducing a single copy of a 4.9 kb genomicspag4transgene (Fig. 1Fand supplementary material Fig. S3). A transgene generating Spag4 protein lacking the SUN domain (supplementary\n\n\nmaterial Fig. S3) did not restore fertility tospag4 null males (Fig. 1F), indicating that Spag4 requires this domain for its role in spermatogenesis.\n\nTo address how Spag4 contributes to male gametogenesis, we examined protein localization in the testis using flies expressing Spag4 tagged C terminally with 6xMYC or GFP. Transgenes similar to thespag4rescue construct containing these tags (supplementary material Fig. S3) restored fertility tospag4males, indicating that the tagged genes have wild type function and that the tagged proteins are likely to localize normally. All independent insertions of both transgenes produced identical localization patterns. In general, Spag4:6xMYC gave stronger signals, but for mature sperm in the seminal vesicle, the Spag4:GFP signal was more robust (Fig. 2J). Most data shown here derives from Spag4:6xMYC.\n\nDynamic localization of Spag4 during spermatogenesis.(A) Whole mount testis (excluding seminal vesicle) expressing Spag4:6xMYC. Lettered arrowheads indicate approximate regions where data in the other panels were obtained. NE localization in polar and mature primary spermatocytes (B) and in round spermatids (E).

Focus of Spag4:6xMYC at centriolar attachment site and along dense complex microtubules (e.g. arrowhead) in early elongating spermatids (G G). A concentration of Spag4:6xMYC at the apical tip of elongating spermatid nuclei (H,I) is shown by the basal body marker YFP:Asl (I) to lie between the BB and the nuclei proper (I). This Spag4:6xMYC focus persists on mature sperm in the seminal vesicle (J), similarly to the BB marker YFP:Asl (K). Red, Spag4:6xMYC; blue, DAPI; green, gamma tubulin in F, alpha Tub:GFP in G, YFP:Asl in I and K, Spag4:GFP in J. Scale bars: 150 um (A), 20 um (B G,J,K) and 10 um (H,I).\n\nIn theDrosophilatestis, germ cells are arranged in a spatio temporal order, from the apical tip to the basal seminal vesicle. Consistent with the in situ hybridization results, Spag4:6xMYC was not detectable at the apical tip, where germ line stem cells and spermatogonia reside (Fig. 1B,Fig. 2A). Four rounds of synchronous divisions yield 16 interconnected spermatogonia, encapsulated in a cyst. These spermatogonia become spermatocytes and commit to meiosis, resulting in 64 interconnected round spermatids. Spag4:6xMYC was first detected in primary spermatocytes where it was associated closely with the NE, as demonstrated by colocalization with lamin (supplementary material Fig. S4D F). Spag4:6xMYC remained at the NE as nuclei became grooved and lobular during primary spermatocyte growth (Fig. 2B). Upon NE breakdown, Spag4:6xMYC colocalized with subsets of microtubules in the meiosis I spindles (Fig. 2C; supplementary material Fig. S4A C), and possibly the parafusorial membranes (Fuller, 1993). In late meiosis II, Spag4:6xMYC again associated with spindle microtubules (supplementary material Fig. S4A C) cupping the astral region of re forming nuclei (Fig. 2D). As post meiotic round spermatids formed, Spag4:6xMYC once again localized to the NE (Fig. 2E).\n\nOnce meiosis is complete, the single centriole of each round spermatid attaches to its nuclear surface, and dramatic morphological changes commence. The centriole differentiates into the BB, from which the axoneme develops, and the nuclei elongate and condense to a needle like shape. The Spag4:6xMYC protein at the NE initially transformed into a hemispherical cap (the 'cap') with the centriole at its apex (Fig. 2F). Subsequently, on the elongating nuclei, Spag4:6xMYC assumed a two component pattern, with a focus of the protein at the centriole or BB attachment site, and a stripe of protein along the long axis of the nuclei (the 'stripe'). From EM studies, Tokuyasu (Tokuyasu, 1974) identified electron dense material, termed the dense complex, which initially formed as a pericentriolar hemispherical cap on round spermatid nuclei and was later present as a stripe rich in microtubules along the length of the elongating nuclei. That the stripe of Spag4:6xMYC is at the position of the dense complex was established by colocalization in testes expressing alpha tubulin:GFP (Fig. 2G G). As elongation proceeded, the Spag4:6xMYC stripe along the dense complex gradually disappeared, and the focus at the BB became more compact and assumed a distinctive trefoil or bell shape (Fig. 2H). As shown by colocalization with the pancentriolar marker YFP:Asl (Varmark et al., 2007) (Fig. 2I I), this focus of Spag4 protein was between the caudal nuclear tip and BB, thus placing it at the ~0.5 um indentation (the 'dent') in the nucleus in which the BB sits (Tokuyasu, 1975). Spag4:GFP persisted on sperm nuclei in the seminal vesicle (Fig. 2J), as did YFP:Asl (Fig. 2K), suggesting that Spag4 remains at the BB attachment site in mature sperm.\n\nThis dynamic pattern of Spag4 localization is unusual; other SUN proteins localize specifically to the NE (Malone et al., 1999;Malone et al., 2003;Hodzic et al., 2004;Kracklauer et al., 2007;Liu et al., 2007), microtubules (Shao et al., 1999) or the MTOC or SPB (Hagan and Yanagida, 1995;Xiong et al., 2008). However, this range of localizations for Spag4 might be more a property of the developmental process in question rather than the protein. So far, other SUN proteins have been studied in less complex developmental situations.\n\nTo address the role of Spag4 during sperm development, we analyzed spermatogenesis in thespag4 null mutant. Our goal was to identify the first detectable defects caused by the mutation, because later problems might be secondary to these initial failures. Despite the association of Spag4 with the NE of the primary spermatocyte, in thespag4mutant, the primary spermatocyte stage appeared similar to the wild type (Fig. 3A,D). However, beginning in the round spermatid stage, some disruption of the centriole linkage was detectable (Fig. 3B,E), which became pronounced and fully penetrant as the nuclei condensed and elongated. In contrast to the wild type (Fig. 3C), in all elongatespag4mutant nuclear bundles examined, BBs labelled with YFP:Asl had lost their normal association with the caudal nuclear tips and were scattered along\n\nthe nuclear bundles (NBs) (Fig. 3G). Furthermore, every NB observed showed some degree of dispersion within the cysts, and the scattered nuclei frequently curled in the terminal region of the testis (Fig. 3H). These findings indicate that Spag4 is required to maintain the correct centriole nuclear association, and has a role in shaping elongated nuclei.\n\nNuclear centriolar dissociation during elongation stages is the earliest visible defect inspag4mutant testes.Centriolar association with primary spermatocyte (A), round spermatid (B) and elongating (C) nuclei in wild type testes. Inspag4mutant testes, centriolar association is normal in primary spermatocytes (D) and mostly normal in round spermatids (E), and early elongating spermatids (F). (G) Fully penetrant nuclear centriolar dissociation becomes apparent in later elongation stages. (H) Nuclei contort in advanced elongation stages. (I) The microtubules of the dense complex stripe are retained onspag4spermatid nuclei. Scale bars: 20 um (A,D), 10 um (B,C,E,I) and 15 um (F,G,H).\n\nIn wild type males, the seminal vesicle fills with mature sperm after several days of sequestration away from females. By contrast, no mature sperm accumulated in the seminal vesicles of sequesteredspag4mutant males (supplementary material Fig. S5), suggesting that developmental processes subsequent to BB nuclear interaction also fail in the mutant. We thus investigated events during individualization, the process immediately following elongation. During individualization, elongated, syncytially connected spermatids are separated into individual sperm. An individualization complex (IC) composed of 64 actin cones that assemble around individual sperm nuclei forms, and then moves along the cyst towards the caudal ends of the spermatids (Hicks et al., 1999;Noguchi and Miller, 2003;Noguchi et al., 2008). As the IC moves along the cyst, each spermatid becomes surrounded by plasma membrane, and excess cytoplasm is pushed as a cytoplasmic bulge to the caudal tip of the cyst to form a 'waste bag'. Using TEM to analyze cross sections of testes, we found thatspag4mutants had defective individualization. In the wild type, cross sections reveal an iterative pattern of individualized spermatids, each with a single axoneme and major and minor mitochondrial derivative (MD) surrounded by plasma membrane (Fig. 4D). Inspag4mutant cysts, arrays of axonemes each associated with a single major and minor MD were also seen (Fig. 4E). Furthermore, although axoneme structure was not analyzed in detail, it appeared grossly normal, with a small number of axonemes lacking the central microtubule doublets (typically less than 10 axonemes/cyst). However, both MDs showed failure to condense fully, a problem that was most marked for the minor MD. But most strikingly, plasma membrane investment largely failed to occur (Fig. 4D,E) and copious amounts of cytoplasm remained in the mutant cysts (Fig. 4E). Thus, sperm individualization and cytoplasmic elimination are severely affected in thespag4mutant.\n\nIndividualization fails in thespag4mutant testes.(A) Normal actin cones of the individualization complex (IC) form on wild type elongated nuclei. (B) Abnormal actin deposition forms aberrant ICs in thespag4mutant. (C) Lack of actin deposition on curled nuclei in thespag4mutant. (D) TEM of wild type elongated cyst cross section. Black lines denote axis through the central doublet of the axoneme; within a wild type cyst, spermatid cross sections (red lines) lie at a constant angle (clockwise 45 degrees to the central doublet. (E) Inspag4mutant cysts, aberrant angles demonstrate spermatid axoneme misalignment. Red arrowhead indicates missing central doublet inspag4axoneme. Images in D and E were taken in comparable regions of wild type and mutant testes (towards terminal epithelium, immediately apical to cyst coiling region). Black arrows indicate major mitochondrial derivatives (MDs) and white arrows, minor MDs. Black arrowhead in D indicates plasma membrane. Both major and minor MDs are less condensed inspag4mutant than in the wild type, and large regions of ribosome rich cytoplasm persist in the cysts (blue dotted line). Scale bars: ~10 um (A C), 500 nm (D,E).\n\nA spatially controlled caspase cascade used in a non apoptotic context promotes spermatid individualization (Huh et al., 2004;Muro et al., 2006). We found that caspase activation, as monitored with an antibody (anti CM1) that recognizes the active form of theDrosophilaeffector caspase Ice (Arama et al., 2003;Muro et al., 2006;Zhong and Belote, 2007), was similar inspag4mutant and wild type testes (supplementary material Fig. S6A B). Successful activation of caspase was further confirmed by staining testes with Acridine Orange, a dye taken up by cysts undergoing individualization. (supplementary material Fig. S6A,B) (Arama and Steller, 2006). Thus, defective individualization in the mutant is not due to defective caspase activation. Instead, the defects appear to originate in aberrant formation of ICs. In thespag4mutant, the individual actin cones were disrupted, with cones no longer forming organized ICs (Fig. 4A,B). In bundles of contorted nuclei, actin cones were often missing altogether (Fig. 4C). The disorganized ICs tended not to progress caudally, and mutant testes lacked cytoplasmic bulges and waste bags, indicating failures in individualization (supplementary material Fig. S6). Despite failed individualization, the elongated syncytial cysts inspag4mutants attempted the final coiling process that precedes sperm movement\n\ninto the seminal vesicle: the terminal region of mutant testes thus filled with coiling cysts (supplementary material Fig. S5D).\n\nspag4encodes a SUN protein and localizes to the NE during most of spermatogenesis. Furthermore, the SUN domain is essential for the role ofspag4in male fertility (Fig. 1F). These findings suggest that Spag4 functions as a typical SUN protein, forming a LINC complex with a KASH protein partner. However, our data indicate that neither of the twoDrosophilaKASH proteins (Klarsicht and MSP 300) is a Spag4 partner in the testis. For both genes, mutations that eliminate the KASH domain are available:msp300KASHwas generated by ends out recombination (Xie and Fischer, 2008) and theklarCD4mutation came from EMS mutagenesis that generated a suitably positioned stop codon (Mosley Bishop et al., 1999;Fischer et al., 2004;Guo et al., 2005). Mutant males of both genotypes were fertile (Fig. 5A) and in all cysts examined formsp300KASHmales,klarCD4males andmsp300KASH; klarCD4double mutant males, (44 95 cysts in 10 testes per genotype), the centrioles remained associated with the spermatid nuclei during elongation (Fig. 5B D) and nuclear bundling, IC formation and IC progression were normal. There was no heterozygous effect of thespag4 null genotype on the fertility ofklarCD4mutant males (Fig. 5A) and the only aberrancy detected in the spermatid cysts of these\n\nvarious genotypes was the occasional apical mislocalization of nuclear bundles inklarCD4andmsp300KASH; klarCD4double mutant males (data not shown). The doubly mutant males were somewhat subfertile (Fig. 5A), but this probably reflects defects in the testis sheath (data not shown) that are not found in the singly mutant males.\n\nLinking the spermatid nucleus to the centriole or BB does not require a KASH domain protein.(A) Fertility assays for KASH domain protein alleles.n=20 for each genotype. Error bars indicate s.d. All genotypes are at least partially fertile. The large error bars inmsp300KASH; klarCD4double mutants are due to high (40%) male death during the assay. Compare withFig. 1Ffor wild type male fertility levels. Centriolar nuclear attachment is normal in elongating nuclei bundles fromklarCD4(B),msp300KASH(C) andmsp300KASH; klarCD4(D) mutant males as shown by tight juxtaposition of gamma tubulin staining (red) of the centriolar adjunct to the dent component of Yuri staining (green, see text,Fig. 6Jand supplementary material Fig. S7). Scale bar: 10 um.\n\nBy contrast, both the male sterile phenotype ofspag4and the post meiotic localization pattern of Spag4:6xMYC are compellingly similar to findings for a male sterile mutation of theyurilocus (yuriF64) and for Yuri nuclear localization (Texada et al., 2008).yuriis a complex locus encoding three major classes of ubiquitously expressed isoforms. The longer isoforms largely consist of coiled coil regions. TheyuriF64mutation eliminates expression of the middle size Yuri isoforms globally, but, uniquely in the testis, the shortest isoform is also not expressed. This loss of two isoforms in the testis might explain the observation that theyuriF64mutant exhibits male sterility, but no other developmental phenotype. An antibody that detects all isoforms showed Yuri accumulation in the postmeiotic nuclear cap, dent and stripe patterns exactly as described above for Spag4 and confirmed here by localization (Fig. 5B D,Fig. 6) and colocalization (supplementary material Fig. S7) studies. InyuriF64, this nuclear localization of Yuri was absent and, as in thespag4 null, the centrioles lost their normal attachments to the post meiotic nuclei and the NBs became disorganized, with nuclei forming curled, distorted shapes. Similar defects in late spermatogenesis were also shared byyuriF64andspag4 null flies, including failure of actin cone formation and individualization, aberrant MD condensation, abortive coiling and absence of mature sperm in the seminal vesicle.\n\nSpag4 and Yuri localize to nuclear envelopes, cap, BB dent and stripe during spermatogenesis.Spag4 and Yuri localization at the NE of primary spermatocytes (A,B), at the centriolar cap on round spermatids (C,D) and in the BB dent and stripe on elongating nuclei (E,F) are compellingly similar.F shows Yuri localization on a single elongate nucleus. In thespag4mutant, Yuri fails to localize to the NE of primary spermatocytes (G) and to the centriolar cap (H) and the BB dent and stripe (I) at later stages. However, Yuri accumulates on the BB and overlays the CA (I).I also shows absence of Yuri stripe and Yuri accumulation on BB for a single nucleus. Upper arrows in F, I show position of BB, lower arrows show position of stripe. Yuri accumulation on the centrioles of primary spermatocytes is also intermittently seen in thespag4mutant (arrow, G). InyuriF64, most elements of the Spag4 localization pattern remain (J,K) but accumulation at the BB dent is lost (L). Control genotypes: in A,w;; spag4:gfp; in C,E,w;; spag4:6xmyc; in B,D,F,F,w1118. Scale bars 25 um (A,B,G,J), 15 um (C,D,H,K), 10 um (E), 6 um (F,F,I,I,L).\n\nAlthough Yuri contains neither a transmembrane nor a KASH domain, these data clearly suggest that Spag4 and Yuri are components of the same pathway for centriolar nuclear association. Furthermore, previous findings for cytoplasmic dynein suggest that it also has a role in this process (Li et al., 2004). Dynein accumulates in the cap pattern on round spermatid nuclei seen for Spag4:6xMYC and Yuri, and loss of this dynein cap in a null mutation of dynein light chain geneDlc90Fresults in failure of centriole nucleus association. We therefore investigated the interactions between these three components further.\n\nAs shown above, Spag4 accumulated on the NE of primary spermatocytes, and then decorated the spindle during meiosis. Yuri localization was not determined during these early stages previously (Texada et al., 2008), and was thus investigated as part of this work. We discovered that although Yuri was present on the primary spermatocyte NEs in some spermatocyte cysts (Fig. 6B), it was not present at all stages, suggesting that its presence there is regulated. On round spermatid nuclei, Yuri and Spag4 both formed centriolar caps (Fig. 6C,D), and the proteins colocalized to the stripe and dent in elongating spermatids (supplementary material Fig. S7;Fig. 6E,F,F).\n\nIn contrast to Spag4:6xMYC, Yuri was not detected on the meiotic spindles, and showed diffuse cytoplasmic staining during these divisions. However, Yuri was sometimes detected associated with the centrioles at the NE immediately before meiosis I (data not shown), and routinely Yuri localized to a circumferential ring on the single centrioles at the meiosis II spindle poles (supplementary material Fig. S8). Inspag4 null flies, Yuri was never detected on the NE of primary spermatocytes, but now could be found on some of the V shaped centriole pairs at the periphery of these cells (Fig. 6G). No obvious new localization of Yuri emerged during meiosis. But strikingly, the post meiotic positioning of Yuri relative to the spermatid nuclei and centrioles was dramatically altered in thespag4mutant. All elements of the usual nuclear pattern   the cap, dent and stripe   were lost (Fig. 6H,I), and at the onset of nuclear elongation, Yuri began to accumulate ectopically on the dissociating centrioles (Fig. 6I). During elongation, as the centrioles become BBs, the toroid shaped centriolar adjunct (CA) develops around the rod like core of the BB (Texada et al., 2008). gamma tubulin is confined to the CA and thus provides an excellent marker for these toroid structures. Using Yuri and gamma tubulin staining, we determined that Yuri not only accumulated on the rod of the BB proper but also frequently coated the outer surface of the CA (Fig. 6I).\n\nConversely, in theyuriF64mutant, Spag4:6xMYC accumulation on the primary spermatocyte NEs, the meiotic spindles, and in the cap and stripe remained unaltered (Fig. 6J,K,L). However, one element of the Spag4 distribution pattern was lost: Spag4:6xMYC no longer accumulated at the dent representing the BB attachment site (Fig. 6L). Thus, with the exception of this site, the interactions between the two proteins are very similar to those predicted for a SUN KASH protein pair.\n\nThe effect of loss of the dynein cap at the round spermatid stage (in aDlc90F null mutant) on the nuclear location of Yuri was reported by Texada and co workers (Texada et al., 2008). Notably, the effect is similar to that described here upon loss of Spag4: the Yuri cap is strongly reduced, the stripe and dent components never\n\ndevelop, and Yuri accumulates on the BB proper. Thus bothspag4and dynein have a role in positioning Yuri on the NE. That Yuri has no role in positioning dynein was determined by examining the location of p50:GFP, a tagged subunit of a dynactin, which is a well established dynein interaction partner (Wojcik et al., 2001). p50:GFP shows identical localization to dynein at the nucleus and meiotic spindles during spermatogenesis (Li et al., 2004;Anderson et al., 2009), including accumulation in the cap on round spermatid nuclei. In theyuriF64mutant, this localization pattern for p50:GFP on the spermatid nuclei remained unchanged (Fig. 7G).\n\nDynein dynactin components require Spag4, but not Yuri, for localization during spermatogenesis.Spag4:6xMYC localization is essentially normal in (A) primary spermatocytes, (B) round spermatids and (C) elongating spermatids in theDlc90Fe155mutant background, although elongating nuclei fail to remain in register. Conversely, the p50:GFP dynactin subunit, which localizes to the centriolar cap on wild type round spermatid nuclei (D D), fails to localize normally in thespag4 null mutant, aggregating instead on centrioles on round spermatid nuclei (E) and in puncta on the CAs of elongating nuclei (F). (G) Localization of p50:GFP to the centriolar cap is unaffected in theyuriF64mutant. Scale bars: 25 um (A), 10 um (B D,F,G), 8 um (E).\n\nThroughout spermatogenesis, Spag4:6xMYC localization was unaffected in theDlc90Fe155 null mutant (Fig. 7A C), indicating that dynein has no role in Spag4 positioning at the NE. But conversely, results for p50:GFP suggest thatspag4has a role in the localization of dynein dynactin both before and after meiosis. Inspag4 null primary spermatocytes, p50:GFP accumulation at the nuclear membrane was lost and instead, similarly to localization of Yuri, p50:GFP accumulated on the paired centrioles at the spermatocyte periphery (data not shown). Likewise, p50:GFP was not detected in the hemispherical cap on round spermatids inspag4 null flies, but again, similarly to Yuri in thespag4mutant background, accumulated on the BB (Fig. 7E), However, at this stage, the p50:GFP accumulation pattern on the BB was distinct from that of Yuri. All of the p50:GFP was associated with the CA torus, upon which it formed a distinctive pattern of dots around the circumference of the structure (Fig. 7F). These findings indicate that Spag4 is required to bring dynein dynactin to the nuclear membrane, whereas Yuri, by contrast, requires dynein dynactin for its accumulation there. A pathway in which the order of gene action isspag4 dynein dynactin yuriis thus in operation. This model suggests that Spag4 and dynein dynactin, and Yuri and dynein dynactin should be simultaneously present at the nuclear surface. Colocalization studies established that these pairs of proteins and all three components together could be detected simultaneously on primary spermatocyte and round spermatid nuclei (supplementary material Fig. S9).",
    "discussion": "In this study, we describe the role of Spag4, aDrosophilaSUN protein. Spag4 is primarily required for linking the centriole and later the BB, two forms of the MTOC of the spermatid, to the nucleus of the elongating spermatid during spermatogenesis. In other contexts, KASH proteins are the essential partners of SUN proteins, forming LINC complexes that tether centrosomes to the NE. However, in single and double mutants of the two KASH protein genes ofDrosophilalacking the KASH domain, centriole attachment to the spermatid nucleus is normal. Thus Spag4 appears to mediate this interaction by a mechanism that does not involve a typical LINC complex. Consistent with this notion, we have found that Spag4 localization on elongated spermatid nuclei is independent of lamin (supplementary material Fig. S10D), which in other contexts is essential for NE localization of LINC complexes.Dictyostelium discoideumcells lack a nuclear lamina, and the SUN protein Sun 1 is thought to interact with chromatin directly (Xiong et al., 2008). Mature sperm also lack a normal nuclear lamina, suggesting that Spag4 might also directly link to chromatin. These unusual features of Spag4 might partly reflect the highly specialized centriole nuclear interaction that it facilitates. As theDrosophilaspermatid centriole differentiates into the BB, complex structural rearrangements occur, followed in the final stages by altered relative positioning of the BB and the nucleus (Tokuyasu, 1974;Tokuyasu, 1975).\n\nIn contrast to the KASH proteins, our studies have identified the coiled coil protein Yuri as an essential component of the postmeiotic Spag4 centriole tethering pathway. In the post meiotic stages, Yuri shows identical nuclear positioning to Spag4, and Spag4 is essential for localization of Yuri to its various nuclear sites. These observations place Yuri downstream of Spag4 in the pathway. However, at the nuclear dent, in which the BB sits, there is mutual dependence between the two proteins for correct localization.\n\nIn addition to this post meiotic pathway, a pre meiotic mechanism exists to bring the centriole pairs of the primary spermatocyte to the NE for function in meiosis. The geneasunder(asun) is required for this process, which involves accumulation of Asun itself, and Asun dependent accumulation of dynein (and p50:GFP) at the primary spermatocyte NE (Anderson et al., 2009). As we show here, both Spag4 and Yuri also associate with the primary spermatocyte NE, with localization of Yuri there being Spag4 dependent. However, in contrast to anasunmutant, no defects in meiosis were found inyuriF64orspag4 null spermatocytes. Thus, no immediate role for the two proteins in pre meiotic centriole nuclear association can be postulated. During meiosis, Spag4 is associated with the spindle and astral microtubules. Although a role for SUN proteins in tethering telomeres to the NE during meiosis has been described (Ding et al., 2007;Penkner et al., 2007), we could not detect altered telomere distribution inspag4 null meiosis (data not shown). The functions of Yuri and Spag4 in these early stages are thus obscure. Association of Spag4 with the spindle could simply represent a storage location.\n\nIf Spag4 were a typical SUN protein, its transmembrane domain would traverse the INM, placing its C terminus in the intermembrane space to interact with a KASH domain protein spanning the ONM. However none of the isoforms of Yuri has either a transmembrane domain or KASH domain, indicating that a direct interaction between the two proteins in the intermembrane space is unlikely. Thus, despite our evidence that the two knownDrosophilaKASH proteins have no role here, it seems likely that some other ONM protein is needed to bring Yuri and Spag4 together. Our findings on the role of cytoplasmic dynein dynactin also make a direct interaction of Yuri and Spag4 unlikely. The order of gene action in the pathway appears to bespag4 dynein dynactin yuri, again probably precluding a direct Spag4 Yuri interaction.\n\nGiven these indications of indirect interaction, it is pertinent to ask where Yuri is localized relative to the NE. Previous EM studies (A. D. Tates, PhD thesis, Leiden University, 1971;Tokuyasu, 1974) have shown that the initial cap component of the dense complex forms in a tight compartment between the nuclear membranes proper and a layer of closely apposed ER tubule. In other tissues, we have established that Yuri shows a strong association with the ER rather than the nuclear membranes per se (Michael J. Texada, Rebecca A. Simonette and William J. Deery, unpublished results). It seems likely therefore that Yuri is not bound to the nuclear membranes, but rather is in close apposition to them through association with the overlying ER. If Spag4 is in the inner nuclear membrane, and Yuri in the overlying ER, several components, including an ONM protein and dynein dynactin, probably link the two proteins. However, given its unusual interactions, Spag4 might not reside in the INM and thus fewer intermediates might be in play.\n\nThe pathway described above is adequate to address the relationship of Yuri and Spag4 at most elements of their nuclear localization patterns. However, at the dent, further interactions must be invoked, because at this site, localization of the two proteins is mutually dependent. This role of Yuri in positioning Spag4 is unlikely to involve dynein dynactin, because Yuri has no effect on the localization of p50:GFP(dynactin) at the nuclear surface. Thus additional molecular interactions must take place. Yuri has three isoforms, and it is possible that at this site, an isoform not active at the other locations is in operation (see further discussion below). Our antibody detects all Yuri isoforms, and thus provides no information on individual isoform location.\n\nThe different molecular activities at the dent and stripe might reflect different roles for the proteins at these two locations. The dent is closely associated with the BB, and at this site the two proteins function in centriole retention and maturation. The stripe is far removed from this position, and it has been suggested that it might strengthen the nuclei along their long axes during elongation and chromatin condensation (Tokuyasu, 1974). Consistent with this possibility, in both theyuriF64and thespag4mutants, the fully elongated nuclei are frequently coiled and distorted along their long axis. The stripe contains microtubules, and interestingly, there is evidence that the stripe microtubules represent a distinct class of structures that do not originate from the BB (Tatsuhiko Noguchi, unpublished results).\n\nIn some ways Yuri is comparable with the KASH protein ZYG 12, which tethers the centrosome to the nucleus in theCaenorhabditis eleganszygote by a mechanism involving dynein (Malone et al., 2003). Similarly to Yuri, ZYG 12 is a coiled coil protein with three isoforms. Furthermore, the longer isoforms of Yuri contain a ~127 residue region with 24% identity and 46% similarity to the ZYG 12 isoforms (supplementary material Fig. S1B). The ZYG 12A isoform localizes to the centrosome, and the B and C isoforms localize to the NE. Direct interaction of the B and C isoforms with dynein leads to close association of the centrosome and nucleus, dimerization of B and C with the A variant, and formation of a stable centrosome nucleus link. We detected association of Yuri with the centrioles during meiosis II, that is, immediately before Yuri begins to function in maintenance of post meiotic centriole nuclear attachment (supplementary material Fig. S8). Furthermore, we identified a role for dynein dynactin in association of Yuri with the nuclear surface. Given these parallels with ZYG 12, it seems possible that the Yuri isoforms might show differential localization between the centriole and the nuclear surface, and that some Yuri isoforms interact directly with dynein. The overall similar behavior of p50:GFP and Yuri in thespag4mutant supports the hypothesis of direct interaction with dynein, but at the same time indicates that Yuri is not directly associated with the dynactin component per se, because the precise localizations of Yuri and p50:GFP on the developing BB in thespag4 null mutant are distinctly different (compareFig. 6I,IandFig. 7F).\n\nMutations inyuriandspag4result in dissociation of BBs from spermatid nuclei, subsequent curling of the elongate nuclei and finally, failure of individualization. Although BB behavior has not been examined for a mutation to Pros alpha6T (a testis specific proteasome subunit), nevertheless, curled, mislocalized spermatid nuclei are found in this mutant along with aberrant actin cone formation and failed individualization (Zhong and Belote, 2007). Therefore, results forspag4, yuriandPros alpha6Tsuggest that dissociation of BB from the nuclei and/or contortion of elongated nuclei correlate with failed IC formation and progression.\n\nHow BB detachment from nuclei and nuclear contortion would affect formation of individual actin cones and progression of the IC is not apparent. One possibility is that components of the dense complex at the cap and/or stripe are requisite precursors for formation of actin cones. Actin cone formation begins with the deposition of F actin filaments along the long axis of the nuclei (Noguchi et al., 2008). The dense complex materials at the cap and the stripe contain F actin, and this F actin is lost inyuriF64(Texada et al., 2008). EM examination of the formation of F actin filaments on the final nuclei of thespag4, yuriF64andPros alpha6Tmutants would address this issue. The male sterile mutationms(3)72Dalso produces contorted spermatid nuclei (Castrillon et al., 1993) and might thus also be defective in BB nuclear attachment, actin cone and IC formation, and sperm individualization.\n\nIn summary, we have identified Spag4 as a component of a centriolar nuclear attachment pathway in spermatogenesis that also requires the coiled coil protein Yuri and cytoplasmic dynein dynactin. Although Spag4 is a SUN protein, its action in this pathway appears not to involve a conventional KASH protein. The disruption of the later stages of spermatogenesis inyuriandspag4mutants might be secondary to the general disruption of events at the spermatid nuclear surface produced in these mutants.",
