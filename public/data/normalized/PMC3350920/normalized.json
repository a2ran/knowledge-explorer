    "abstract": "The 14 3 3 proteins specifically bind a number of client proteins to influence important pathways, including flowering timing via the photosensory system. For instance, 14 3 3 proteins influence the photosensory system through interactions with Constans (CO) protein. 14 3 3 associations with the photosensory system were further studied in this investigation using 14 3 3 T DNA insertion mutants to study root and chloroplast development. The 14 3 3 u T DNA insertion mutant,14 3 3u 1, had shorter roots than the wild type and the difference in root length could be influenced by light intensity. The 14 3 3  T DNA insertion mutants also had shorter roots, but only when grown under narrow bandwidth red light. Five day old 14 3 3 T DNA insertion andcomutants all had increased root greening compared with the wild type, which was influenced by light wavelength and intensity. However, beyond 10 d of growth,14 3 3u 1roots did not increase in greening as much as wild type roots. This study reveals new developmental roles of 14 3 3 proteins in roots and chloroplasts, probably via association with the photosensory system.\n\nKeywords:Chloroplast, photosensory system, plastid, 14 3 3 proteins, root development",
    "methods": "Arabidopsisseeds were sterilized as previously described byPaulet al.(2001). Thirty to forty seeds of each line were planted onto 0.5x MS vertical plates, which consisted of 0.22% MS salts (Murashige and Skoog, 1962), 0.025% MES buffer, 0.5% sucrose, 0.1% 1000x MS vitamins (Murashige and Skoog, 1962), and 0.8% agar. Nitrate free media were prepared as above, except that the MS salt mix was substituted for nitrogen free MS salt mix (Product #MSP007; Caisson Laboratories, Logan, UT), 1 mM ammonium citrate was added and the media was adjusted to a pH of 6.5. After planting, the seed containing plates were incubated at 4  degreesC in the dark for 48 h. The plates were then placed under the appropriate light conditions. Constant light grown seedlings were grown under a light bank emitting 60 70 umol m 2s 1of light (two Cool White Sylvania bulbs and two Gro Lux bulbs). Constant red light (630 nm at 25 umol m 2s 1), blue light (470 nm at 40 umol m 2s 1) or dark grown plants were exposed to white light for 1 h, after the 48 h cold treatment, and placed under Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) or in the dark. Treatments included irradiation with specific fluence rates of red light (630 nm; Quantum Devices, Barneveld WI) or blue light (470 nm; Ledtronics Inc, Torrance CA), and a custom design used byFoltaet al.(2005).\n\nSeed stocks for the PHYB T DNA insertion mutant lines Salk_022035 and Salk_069700 were obtained from theArabidopsisBiological Resource Center. The seeds were planted on wet Fafard Fine germinating Mix soil and incubated at 4  degreesC in the dark for 3 d. The seeds were exposed to light for 1 h to promote germination, then placed under 20 umol m 2s 1of narrow bandwidth red light for 4 d. All seedlings were cleared from the soil that did not exhibit reduced hypocotyl elongation inhibition. The remaining seedlings that did exhibit reduced hypocotyl elongation inhibition were later screened for homozygous T DNA insertion using PCR. A left border T DNA specific primer (LBb1) and two, T DNA flanking, PHYB gene specific primers were used to identify lines that were homozygous for T DNA insertion into the respective 14 3 3 genes. It is important to add that 100% of the lines, from both Salk_022035 and Salk_069700, selected as exhibiting reduced hypocotyl elongation inhibition were identified as homozygous PHYB T DNA insertion mutants.\n\nThe phenotypes exhibited by Salk_022035 and Salk_069700 in this study were comparable between the two separate lines. In order to make the data easier to convey, only the phenotypic data of Salk_022035 were included in the results and discussion of this study.\n\nDigital images of roots were captured using an Epson Perfection 3170 Photo scanner for further analysis. Root lengths were assessed by measuring root lengths of eachArabidopsisline of wild type,Res mu, and14 3 3u 1with the University of Texas Health Science Center San Antonio Dental School (UTHSCSA) Image Tool software (http://ddsdx.uthscsa.edu/dig/itdesc.html). The root measurements collected were standardized and processed in Microsoft Excel.\n\nRoots were viewed with an Olympus BX51 fluorescent microscope coupled to an Evolution MP cooled charge coupled device camera with Q capture 2.60 software (Quantitative Imaging, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada). Digital photos were taken through a 10x objective and captured with no binning. Regions identical in size were cropped from the digital images taken of roots from eachArabidopsisline. Slides were prepared by mounting the roots in water between a slide and cover slip.\n\nRoots from 5 d oldArabidopsisseedlings were viewed with a confocal LSM5 Pascal Laser Scanning Microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). The light source used was a helium neon laser emitting 543 nm light. The light emitted by the helium neon laser was filtered with a long pass filter resulting in a wavelength of 560 nm, similar to the conditions used to view rhodamine. Images were collected of the red fluorescing chloroplast, as well as Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) images to provide a reference for root size and shape.\n\nFour or more fluorescent microscope images of chloroplasts in root tissue were cropped in order to standardize the images to equal sizes using Adobe Photoshop. The standardized images were then processed with the RGB Measure Plus plug in of Image J. Tonal levels recorded by the RGB Measure Plus plug in were then processed with Microsoft Excel.",
    "results": "Wild type and14 3 3u 1were grown on vertical MS media agar plates under constant light conditions and assayed for root lengths after 8 d of growth (Fig. 1). The roots of14 3 3u 1,co,andphyBwere statistically shorter than wild type levels (alpha=9.006x10 61, 0.0011, and 3.744x10 13, respectively). The14 3 3u 1roots were only 25% of wild type root length (Fig. 1A, B), although developmentally similar in the aerial tissue. Wild type root length was restored by the reintroduction of14 3 3uinRes mu, a14 3 3u 1line that was complemented by the native 14 3 3 u gene (Mayfieldet al., 2007) (Fig. 1B, C). Root lengths of14 3 3 1and14 3 3 2were also comparable with that of wild type roots after 8 d of growth (Fig. 1B, C).\n\nShorter root lengths of14 3 3u 1compared with wild type root lengths. After 8 d of growth,14 3 3u 1exhibited shorter roots than wild type (A). The 14 3 3 T DNA insertion mutants,Res mu,co,phyB,and the wild type were grown on vertical agar plates in constant light. The average root lengths after 8 d of growth were measured (B). The roots of14 3 3u 1andphyBwere 30% and 70% of the wild type root length, while other lines were equal in root length to wild type (B). Error bars represent standard error and asterisks indicate lines with a significant difference in root length compared to wild type using attest (B). The root lengths of the 14 3 3 T DNA insertion mutants and the wild type were measured daily in order to get a time course of root lengths (C).14 3 3u 1exhibited shorter roots that consistently increase in the deviation from wild type root lengths through 8 d of growth. Error bars represent standard error (B, C).\n\nThe root growth results for14 3 3u 1were in stark contrast to the results for 14 3 3insertion mutants. Two separate T DNA insertion alleles for 14 3 3showed wild type root lengths under constant light conditions. CO also exhibited wild type root length, whilephyBhad a slightly decreased root length (Fig. 1B).\n\nThe time course of root length was studied to determine if there was a particular time point that14 3 3u 1root length begins to deviate from that of the wild type andRes mu, or the two alleles of 14 3 3. Root lengths were measured daily over 8 d of growth (Fig. 1C).14 3 3u 1exhibited an overall slower increase in root length throughout the entire 8 d compared with the wild type, with no particular day characterized as a specific point of separation of14 3 3u 1from the wild type root length. After day 2, when the difference in root length is measurable, the14 3 3u 1root length begins to lag behind, and remain at a slower and constant growth rate, while wild type,Res mu, and the 14 3 3u alleles accelerate in growth rate.\n\nThe 14 3 3 proteins interact with nitrate reductase (NR), as part of the NR inactivation process (Bachmannet al., 1996;Moorheadet al., 1996). In fact, of the 14 3 3 isoforms tested, 14 3 3 is the third most effective at inactivating nitrate reductase (the 14 3 3u isoform was not tested in the study) (Bachmannet al., 1996). Because of the 14 3 3 protein association with nitrate reductase inactivation, it was possible that the loss of 14 3 3u protein resulted in overactive nitrate reductase. Overactive nitrate reductase protein, in combination with nitrate rich media, could have resulted in a reduced need for root elongation since the roots had adequate nitrate levels available. In order to factor out nitrate reductase activity as the cause of14 3 3u 1decreased root length, plants were grown on nitrate free media using ammonium citrate as the only nitrogen source. The14 3 3u 1root lengths were 40% of the wild type, when grown on nitrate free media for 14 d (seeSupplementary Fig. S1atJXBonline), indicating that increased nitrate reductase activity was not the major factor for shorter14 3 3u 1roots.\n\nThe 14 3 3 T DNA insertion mutants14 3 3u 1,14 3 3 1, and14 3 3 2all exhibit reduced hypocotyl growth inhibition under narrow bandwidth red light during early development (Mayfieldet al., 2007), similar to PHYB and PHYB associated protein mutants (Neff and Chory, 1998;Huqet al., 2000). In order to test if14 3 3u 1exhibits light dependent deviations in root length, as doesphyB, the 14 3 3 T DNA insertion mutants were grown alongsidephyBand the wild type under three separate light intensities: full light (60 70 umol m 2s 1), low light (5 umol m 2s 1), and dark growth conditions. A CO mutant,co, was also included in all of the altered light condition experiments because CO is a binding partner of 14 3 3 proteins and is associated with 14 3 3 mediated red light signalling (Mayfieldet al., 2007). Seeds were planted on vertical plates and exposed to light for 1 h to promote germination, then transferred to full light, low light, or dark chambers. Root lengths were measured after 8 d (Fig. 2A, B). Under dark conditions,14 3 3 1,14 3 3 2,co, andphyBroots were similar in length to the wild type roots.14 3 3u 1roots were slightly shorter than wild type roots when grown in dark and low light conditions.14 3 3u 1roots were 80% and 68% of wild type root length in darkness and low light, respectively. By contrast,14 3 3u 1roots were 25% of wild type root length when grown in full light conditions. As light intensity growth conditions decreased,14 3 3u 1andRes muroot lengths became more comparable (Fig. 2C).Res muroot lengths were comparable with the wild type in all three light conditions.\n\nThe influence of14 3 3u 1root lengths by different light intensities. The 14 3 3 T DNA insertion mutants,Res mu,co, phyB, and the wild type were grown on vertical agar plates in dark (A) and low light (B) conditions for 8 d and root lengths were measured. The roots of14 3 3u 1were 77% and 68% of the wild type roots in dark and low light conditions, respectively. Root lengths of14 3 3u 1andRes muwere compared as a % of wild type root lengths when grown in three conditions: full light, low light, and dark (C).Res muroots were equal to wild type root lengths in all treatments. The roots of14 3 3u 1were more comparable to wild type lengths as the light conditions decreased in intensity. Error bars represent standard error and asterisks indicate lines with a significant difference in root length compared with the wild type using attest (A, B).\n\nRoots experiencing prolonged light exposure exhibit greening resulting from chloroplast development (Whatley, 1983). PHYB is a positive regulator of chloroplast development inArabidopsisroots (Usamiet al., 2004). Due to similarities of14 3 3u 1andphyBin the influence on root length by light intensity, the 14 3 3 T DNA insertion mutants were assayed for root chloroplast development along with the wild type,Res mu,co, and phyB. Plants were grown on vertical agar plates under constant light conditions for 5 d. Roots of the 5 d old plants were viewed with a fluorescent microscope. The roots were illuminated with blue light (488 nm) and viewed through a long pass filter in order to view the red autofluorescence of chlorophyll.\n\nA large number of chloroplasts were visualized within the roots of the 14 3 3 T DNA insertion mutants andco(Fig. 3A). Wild type andRes muroots developed chloroplasts, but in smaller numbers compared with the 14 3 3 T DNA insertion mutants andco. The roots ofphyBdid not develop any observable chloroplasts under white light. The roots of14 3 3u 1had the most dramatic increase in chloroplast number. Theco,14 3 3 1, and14 3 3 2roots had slightly fewer chloroplasts than14 3 3u 1.\n\nIncreased numbers of chloroplasts in the roots of the 14 3 3 T DNA insertion mutants andcoafter 5 d of growth. The 14 3 3 T DNA insertion mutants,Res mu,co, phyB,and the wild type were grown on vertical agar plates for 5 d under constant light. Roots were illuminated with a blue light and visualized through a GFP long pass filter with a fluorescent microscope (A). The roots of the 14 3 3 T DNA insertion mutants andcocontained more chloroplasts, which autofluoresce as a red colour. Pictures of roots from each line were cropped to equal sizes and the red tonal levels were measured with the RGB Measure Plus plug in of the ImageJ program (B). The red tonal levels were higher for14 3 3u 1,14 3 31,14 3 3 2andcoroots compared with the wild type. Error bars represent standard error and asterisks indicate lines with a significant difference in root length compared with the wild type using attest (B).\n\nThe red channel level within the frame of each photograph was also quantified (Fig. 3B). Photo frames of equal size, exposure, and colour adjustment were taken of 4 6 roots from each line. The red channel tonal levels of each photo frame were quantified using the RGB Measure Plus plug in of the ImageJ software package. Quantification of the red light tonal levels showed that the average red tonal level for the 14 3 3 T DNA insertion mutants andcowere higher than the wild type orRes mu. T tests confirmed that red tonal levels of14 3 3u 1,14 3 3 1,14 3 3 2, andcoroot pictures were statistically higher than the wild type levels (alpha=0.0000, 0.0067, 0.0127, and 0.0011, respectively). The photo frames ofphyBroots contained statistically lower red tonal levels than the wild type, as confirmed by attest (alpha=0.0253).\n\nThe dramatic increase in chloroplasts in14 3 3u 1roots was also examined with confocal microscopy. Wild type and14 3 3u 1plants were vertically grown for 5 d under full light conditions (60 70 umol m 2s 1), and root sections were observed to determine the distribution of chloroplasts (Fig. 4). The DIC images illustrated that the roots were of the same developmental age, with cells of comparable size, in the wild type and14 3 3u 1plants (Fig. 4A, D). Fluorescent images of the wild type and14 3 3u 1showed that while the plastid size is comparable for each plant, the quantity of plastids in the14 3 3u 1roots is around 2 fold that of the wild type (Fig. 4B, E).\n\nConfocal microscopy of plastid distribution in the roots of wild type (WT) and14 3 3u 1. The left hand panel shows anArabidopsisseedling; the region of root presented in the right hand panels is indicated with a white box. (A, D) The fluorescing plastids merged with the corresponding DIC image. (B, E) The fluorescing plastids alone. (C, F) The overlay of images (A)+(B) and (D)+(E), respectively.\n\nRoot lengths were also assayed from plants grown on vertical agar plates for 8 d under narrow bandwidth red (25 umol m 2s 1) or blue (50 umol m 2s 1) light (Fig. 5). The14 3 3u 1roots were 65% or 60% of the length of wild type roots in red or blue light conditions, respectively.14 3 3 1and14 3 3 2roots were similar in length to wild type roots when grown under blue light, but shorter when grown under red light. The14 3 3 1and14 3 3 2roots were 83% and 86% of the length of wild type roots, respectively. The differences in root lengths of red light grown14 3 3 1and14 3 3 2were confirmed to be statistically different byttest (alphaalpha=0.0003 and 0.0050, respectively).\n\nRoot lengths of the 14 3 3 T DNA insertion mutants are influenced by red and blue light. The 14 3 3 T DNA insertion mutants,Res mu, co, phyB, and the wild type were grown on vertical agar plates under constant red or blue light conditions for 8 d and root lengths were measured. The roots of14 3 3u 1were 65% and 59% of wild type roots in red and blue light conditions, respectively. The roots of the 14 3 3  T DNA insertion mutants were similar in length to wild type roots when grown under blue light, but14 3 3 1and14 3 3 2were 83% and 86% of wild type roots in red light conditions, respectively. Error bars represent standard error and asterisks indicate lines with a significant difference in root length compared with the wild type using attest.\n\nRoot chloroplast development can be influenced by growth under different wavelengths of light (Usamiet al., 2004). When grown in dark or low light conditions, roots from none of the lines studied developed observable chloroplasts (data not shown). The 14 3 3 T DNA insertion mutants,co,phyB,Res mu, and the wild type were also grown under narrow bandwidth red or blue light to test whether these wavelengths influence root chloroplast development differently among the lines. Plants were grown for 5 d under red or blue light and then the roots were assayed for chloroplasts (Fig. 6). As previously published (Usamiet al., 2004), blue light stimulated more root chloroplast development than red light. Furthermore, blue light stimulated more chloroplast development in the roots than white light. The roots of blue light grown14 3 3u 1developed a higher number of chloroplasts than any of the other lines (Fig. 6A). Quantification of red tonal levels confirmed that14 3 3u 1roots contain higher red tonal levels than both the wild type andRes mu(Fig. 6B). The red tonal level of blue light grown14 3 3u 1roots was statistically higher than that of wild type orRes muroots as confirmed byttest (alpha=0.0012 and 0.0323, respectively).\n\nRed and blue light influence the numbers of chloroplasts in the roots. The 14 3 3 T DNA insertion mutants,Res mu, co, phyB, and the wild type were grown on vertical agar plates for 5 d under constant red or blue light. Roots were illuminated with a blue light and visualized through a GFP long pass filter with a fluorescent microscope (A, C). All of the lines developed increased numbers of chloroplasts when grown under blue light compared with white light, but14 3 3u 1roots contained higher numbers of chloroplasts than the other lines (A). When grown under red light, the roots of14 3 3u 1andcowere the only lines that developed high enough numbers of chloroplasts to be visualized with a fluorescent microscope (C). Pictures of roots from each line were cropped to equal sizes and the red tonal levels were measured with the RGB Measure Plus plug in of the ImageJ program (B, D). When grown under blue light, the red tonal levels were higher for only14 3 3u 1roots compared with the wild type (B). When grown under red light, the red tonal levels were equal for all lines measured (D). Although chloroplasts could only be visualized for14 3 3u 1andcoroots, the differences in tonal levels were not enough to be detected by the RGB Measure Plus program. Error bars represent standard error and asterices indicate lines with a significant difference in root length compared with the wild type using attest (B, D).\n\nOut of the lines grown under red light,14 3 3u 1andcowere the only sets that developed noticeably visible chloroplasts in the roots (Fig. 6C). The small number of chloroplasts in the14 3 3u 1andcoroots was not enough to raise the red tonal level of either mutant to a significant difference from that of wild type roots (Fig. 6D).",
    "discussion": "This study characterizes several novel functions of 14 3 3 proteins in root growth and chloroplast development. The 14 3 3 u T DNA insertion mutants exhibited altered root lengths and chloroplast numbers in the roots. The phenotypes exhibited by the 14 3 3 u T DNA insertion mutants could all be influenced by growth conditions altered in light intensity or wavelength. The 14 3 3T DNA insertion mutants exhibited altered root lengths in red light and also had altered numbers of chloroplasts in the roots. Most of the root development phenotypes exhibited by these 14 3 3 T DNA insertion mutants can be attributed to deficiencies in the photosensory system.\n\nThe roots of14 3 3u 1were only 25% as long as the roots of the wild type after 8 d of growth under constant light (Fig. 1B). However, the roots of14 3 3 1and14 3 3 2are the same length as the wild type after 8 d under constant light. The 14 3 3 u protein is therefore an important factor in root growth, while 14 3 3does not have an observable effect on root length under constant white light.\n\nThe differences in root length in14 3 3u 1are influenced by light intensity (Fig. 2). The root length of14 3 3u 1was more comparable to wild type roots when grown in the dark, compared with plants grown in full light conditions (Fig. 2A). Under low light conditions, the14 3 3u 1root length percentage compared with the wild type root length was intermediate between the root length percentages under full light and dark conditions (Fig. 2B, C).\n\nAlong with reduced hypocotyl growth inhibition under narrow bandwidth red light, phytochromes are implicated in root elongation and gravitropic response (Correllet al., 2003;Correll and Kiss, 2005). The PHYB mutant,phyB, exhibits significantly reduced root elongation rates compared with the wild type when grown in light, but does not exhibit this same reduced root elongation rate when grown in the dark (Correll and Kiss, 2005), which was also observed in this study (Figs 1,2). The roots of14 3 3u 1were not the same length as wild type roots in dark grown conditions. Because the roots of14 3 3u 1were still shorter than wild type roots in dark conditions, the difference in14 3 3u 1root length cannot be solely attributed to deficiencies in light signalling. Future studies will identify additional light influenced and other developmental differences in14 3 3u 1roots.\n\nFurther phenotypic similarity between the 14 3 3 T DNA insertion mutants andphyBwas noticeable under narrow bandwidth red light conditions (Fig. 5). The roots ofphyBgrown under red light grow similarly to when they are grown in dark conditions (Correll and Kiss, 2005) as also seen inFigs 2and5. This similarity in root lengths under red light and dark conditions was also true for the 14 3 3 T DNA insertion mutants. The root lengths of14 3 3u 1were 8 mm after 8 d of growth in both red light and dark conditions. The root lengths of14 3 3 1and14 3 3 2were 10 mm after 8 d of growth in both red light and dark conditions. Further similarity to phyB, the root lengths of14 3 3 1and14 3 3 2were comparable with the wild type when grown in dark conditions, but shorter when grown under narrow bandwidth red light.\n\nThe 14 3 3 T DNA insertion mutants also exhibit reduced hypocotyl elongation inhibition under red light in the first 4 d of growth (Mayfieldet al., 2007).14 3 3 1and14 3 3 2grown under narrow bandwidth red light also exhibit a more vertical directional growth habit than the wild type (Mayfieldet al., 2007), similar tophyB(Liscum and Hangarter, 1993;Poppeet al., 1996;Robson and Smith, 1996).\n\nUnder blue light,14 3 3 1and14 3 3 2root lengths were comparable with wild type, but14 3 3u 1still exhibited shorter roots (Fig. 5). Wild type root lengths were 36% longer when grown under blue light compared with dark conditions.14 3 3u 1root lengths were 17% longer when grown under blue light in comparison to dark conditions. The difference in14 3 3u 1root length when grown in the dark compared with blue light was less distinct than comparing the difference in root length of light  and dark grown14 3 3u 1, indicating that14 3 3u 1is slightly deficient in blue light signalling, a phenotype that is similar, but not as strong as incry1mutants (Canameroet al., 2006).\n\nHypocotyl elongation inhibition is similar for14 3 3u 1and wild type plants grown under narrow bandwidth blue light (Mayfieldet al., 2007). Although 14 3 3 u was not found to be associated with blue light signalling in the hypocotyl during early development, these root length data indicate that 14 3 3 u is associated with blue light signalling in the roots during early development. The association of 14 3 3 proteins with blue light has also been seen in broad bean, where the blue light photoreceptor, PHOT1, was identified as a client protein of 14 3 3s (Kinoshitaet al., 2003).\n\nThe roots of 14 3 3 T DNA insertion mutants andcoexhibit increased chloroplast numbers, or greening, after 5 d of growth on vertical agar plates, whilephyBroots exhibit decreased chloroplast numbers (Fig. 3). The development of chloroplasts in the roots can be influenced by both light intensity and different wavelengths of light. Dark grown plants do not develop enough chloroplasts for detectable levels of root greening, while higher numbers of chloroplasts are developed in the roots of plants grown under blue light than plants grown under red light (Usamiet al., 2004). Low light grown plants of all lines studied also did not develop enough chloroplasts for visualization in the roots, indicating that a threshold level of light is required for chloroplast development in the roots.\n\nRoot greening under red light conditions is primarily induced by PHYB signalling, whereas, under blue light conditions, root greening is mainly induced by CRY1 and CRY2 signalling (Usamiet al., 2004). However,phyAphyBmutants are deficient in blue light induced chloroplast development, indicating that phytochromes are also important for blue light induced chloroplast development in the roots (Usamiet al., 2004). Under blue light,14 3 3u 1exhibited a quantifiable increase in root greening (Fig. 6B), indicating that 14 3 3uregulation of chloroplast development in the roots is partly associated with blue light signalling. Differences seen in both root length and greening under blue light will be evaluated in future studies, especially in the potential for 14 3 3 association with CRY1 and its role in root length and greening (Usamiet al., 2004;Canameroet al., 2006).\n\nThe increased chloroplast numbers in the roots of the 14 3 3 T DNA insertion mutants andcoindicated that 14 3 3 proteins and CO are negative regulators of chloroplast development in the roots. No quantifiable difference in root greening was detected in the roots of any of the lines grown under red light (Fig. 6D), although14 3 3u 1andcowere the only lines to develop high enough numbers of chloroplasts to be visualized with a fluorescent microscope (Fig. 6C). Additional work is necessary to further characterize 14 3 3 u or CO as co regulators of chloroplast development in the roots via red light signalling. In fact, this is the first report implicating CO with root development, however, CONSTANS LIKE3 (COL3) is associated with root development (Dattaet al., 2006).\n\nAlthough PHYB has not been identified as a protein binding partner of 14 3 3 proteins, phytochromes are regulated by phosphorylation, and the association of PHYB with several phosphorylation events presents many situations of possible 14 3 3 protein involvement (Kimet al., 2004). In addition, PHYB and PHYA induce phosphorylation of such proteins as PKS1 and PIF3 (Fankhauseret al., 1999;Al Sadyet al., 2006).\n\nThis study presents novel roles of 14 3 3 proteins in root and chloroplast development, as well as new roles of CO in chloroplast development. Transcription levels of CO are increased in early development upon irradiance of 4 d old dark grown seedlings with a far red light treatment (Teppermanet al., 2001), but a function for CO in early development has not been defined. In fact, the increase in chloroplast development in roots is the first reported phenotype forcoin early development. The activity of CO in chloroplast development may only be as a component of the activity of CO and the COL proteins.\n\nThe present reverse genetic study establishes novel, isoform specific roles of 14 3 3 proteins inArabidopsisroot and chloroplast development. 14 3 3 proteins are increasingly recognized as a major node in the plant interactome, an interaction node that includes CO and other signalling molecules related to light responses (AIMC, 2011). Further, the roles of 14 3 3 proteins in root and chloroplast development are controlled by light intensity or wavelength. 14 3 3 TDNA insertion mutants also exhibit reduced hypocotyl elongation and time to flowering, compared with the wild type (Mayfieldet al., 2007). Both the hypocotyl elongation and flowering timing phenotypes are, in part, due to 14 3 3 binding/influence of CO (Mayfieldet al., 2007). The study presented here also characterizes CO as a potential factor in root chloroplast development ofArabidopsisduring early development. Further work will be necessary to understand the mechanism of 14 3 3 control of both root and chloroplast development and how the association of 14 3 3 proteins and CO factors into these processes.",
