    "abstract": "Natural killer (NK) cells are an important first line of defense against malignant cells. Because of the potential for increased cancer risk from astronaut exposure to space radiation, we determined whether microgravity present during spaceflight affects the body's defenses against leukemogenesis. Human NK cells were cultured for 48h under normal gravity and simulated microgravity (suG), and cytotoxicity against K 562 (CML) and MOLT 4 (T ALL) cells was measured using standard methodology or under continuous suG. This brief exposure to suG markedly reduced NK cytotoxicity against both leukemias, and these deleterious effects were more pronounced in continuous suG. RNA seq performed on NK cells from two additional healthy donors provided insight into the mechanism(s) by which suG reduced cytotoxicity. Given our prior report of space radiation induced human T ALL in vivo, the reduced cytotoxicity against MOLT 4 is striking and raises the possibility that uG may increase astronaut risk of leukemogenesis during prolonged missions beyond LEO.\n\nSubject terms:Tumour immunology, Haematological cancer",
    "methods": "The human natural killer cell line NK 92MI (ATCC CRL 2408) was used for initial cytotoxicity experiments. During expansion, cells were cultured in standard tissue culture flasks in Alpha Minimum Essential medium without ribonucleosides and deoxyribonucleosides but with 2mM L glutamine and 1.5g/L sodium bicarbonate. Additional components included: 0.2mM inositol 0.1mM 2mercaptoethanol 0.02mM folic acid horse serum to a final concentration of 12.5% fetal bovine serum to a final concentration of 12.5% (This medium formulation will be referred to as \"NK medium\" from here forward). T ALL cell line MOLT 4 (ATCC CRL1582) and Erythroleukemic cell line K 562 (ATCC CCL243) were used as target cells. All cell lines used for the present studies were tested and confirmed to be mycoplasma negative using the MycoStrip Mycoplasma detection kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (InvivoGen US, San Diego, CA, USA). During culture and expansion, these cells were grown in RPMI 1640+10% FBS and IMDM+10% FBS respectively. All cytotoxicity experiments, however, were conducted in complete NK medium, regardless of cell type.\n\nFollowing the initial studies with the NK 92MI cell line, subsequent cytotoxicity experiments and RNA seq studies were performed using primary NK cells isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy volunteer donors (n=3donors for cytotoxicity studies and n=2additional donors for RNA seq studies;in all cases, donors were males 25 35years of age; blood was collected by a physician in accordance with an IRB approved by Wake Forest University Health Sciences). In short, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from 20mL of whole blood using HistopaqueTM 1077 (Sigma Diagnostics, Livonia, MI, USA). Activation and preferential expansion of NK cells was conducted using NK MACS Medium (Miltenyi Biotech, Auburn, CA, USA), supplemented with 5% Human AB Serum (Corning Life Sciences, Durham, NC, USA) and 500IU/mL Human Recombinant IL 2 (StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada), using the manufacturer's protocol. Following the course of activation and expansion in tissue culture flasks under conditions of normal gravity, NK cells were isolated using a commercially available human NK Cell Isolation Kit in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (MACS Miltenyi Biotec). Isolated human NK cells were placed back into NK expansion media and immediately used for cytotoxicity assays, as detailed below. Cell density and viability of all cell types were assessed by manual counting of Trypan Blue stained aliquots of each population on a hemacytometer.\n\nNK 92MI cells or primary NK cells isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy donors were cultured in simulated microgravity using Synthecon's Rotating Cell Culture System (RCCS) in conjunction with High Aspect Ratio Vessels (HARVs). Initially, NK 92MI cells were cultured in microgravity for a period of 48h. These cells were then removed, centrifuged and resuspended in fresh medium and plated against 500,000 target cells at various effector to target (E:T) ratios. NK and leukemic cell lines were cocultured for a period of 4h. The supernatants were then harvested, and cytotoxicity was measured using Promega's CytoTox 96 Non Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay, which measures release of Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH). Controls accounting for spontaneous release of both target and effector cells, as well as media background were also performed. Cytotoxicity was measured as a percentage of absorbance after complete lysis of target cells (achieved with the addition of 2% Triton X 100).\n\nTo conduct an assay in which NK cells were continuously exposed to conditions of microgravity, four HARVs were used simultaneously. NK 92MI cells were cultured in simulated microgravity in two HARVs for 48h. Without stopping rotation (and therefore maintaining the cells in freefall), the HARVs were sampled to assess cell density and viability. Leukemic cells were then added to one of the HARVs containing NK cells at an E:T ratio of 10:1. Four separate HARVs were implemented containing the following conditions. (A) NK cells and leukemic cells; (B) NK cells alone; (C) leukemic cells alone; (D) leukemic cells with the addition of 2% Triton X 100. Together, these four vessels were used to determine the cytotoxicity of NK cells against target cells as well as the spontaneous death of NK and leukemic cells individually. These values were then compared to the total lysis of target cells in D. Extreme consideration was taken in order to ensure all cell concentrations and media were identical.\n\nAll experiments were also conducted in both standard tissue culture flasks and stationery HARVs in normal gravity to account for any differences in materials. Initial experiments were attempted using HARVs rotating horizontally to account for vibrations and shear stress caused by the motion of rotation, but viability of NK cells after 48h of culture in this fashion was so low it prevented cytotoxicity assays from being performed. Additionally, the rationale of using this condition as a control is questionable given that the shear stress experienced by these cells is significantly higher than those in freefall during vertical rotation. Lastly, horizontal rotation results in a centrifugal force vector, causing the cells within the vessel to migrate to the edges. Effectively, this phenomenon would artificially increase cell density at these locations, mostly likely resulting in inaccurate measurements of cytotoxicity.\n\nPBMCs were isolated from whole blood, and NK cells were then immediately isolated from PBMCs using the methods described above. Isolated NK cells were directly suspended in NK MACS Medium and transferred to HARVs under conditions of normal and simulated microgravity for 24h, after which RNA was immediately isolated from each cell population using the RNeasy plus kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Germantown MD, USA). cDNA libraries were then prepared from 50ng of each RNA extract using a NEXTFLEX Combo Seq mRNA/miRNA Kit (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA). Libraries were quantified using a KAPA Library Quantification Kit (Roche Sequencing and Life Science, Indianapolis, IN, USA), with average fragment length determined by a 4200 TapeStation System (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Libraries were normalized prior to pooling, and the pooled libraries were sequenced using an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 System (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), generating 76 bp single end reads.\n\nRaw sequence reads were imported into Partek Flow software (Partek, St. Louis, MO, USA) for analysis. Cutadapt54was used to trim the random barcode (4 bases) from the 5' end and adapter (AAAAAAAAAA) from the 3' end of the reads. Bases with a Phred quality score <20 were trimmed, and reads <15 bases in length were discarded. High quality reads were then aligned and quantified to the hg38 GENCODE reference database using STAR55and an expectation/maximization (E/M) algorithm similar to the one in Xing et al.56, respectively. Transcript level counts were summed to gene level, normalized with the median of ratios method used in DESeq257and log2 transformed. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to assess global patterns of expression across exposures.\n\nDifferential gene expression analysis was performed using ROSALIND (https://rosalind.bio/), with a HyperScale architecture developed by ROSALIND, Inc. (San Diego, CA, USA). The Benjamini Hochberg adjustedp value (Padj)58and log2fold change (LFC) was calculated for each gene. A Padjcutoff of 1e 10 was used to eliminate background in each analysis, and the entire gene dataset was used as the reference set for analysis to control for bias. Read Distribution percentages, violin plots, identity heatmaps, and sample MDS plots were generated as part of the QC step. The limma R library59was used to calculate fold changes andp values and perform optional covariate correction. Clustering of genes for the final heatmap of differentially expressed genes was done using the PAM (Partitioning Around Medoids) method using the fpc R library60that takes into consideration the direction and type of all signals on a pathway, the position, role and type of every gene, etc. Hypergeometric distribution was used to analyze the enrichment of pathways, gene ontology, domain structure, and other ontologies. The topGO R library61, was used to determine local similarities and dependencies between GO terms in order to perform Elim pruning correction. Several database sources were referenced for enrichment analysis, including Interpro62, NCBI63, MSigDB64,65, REACTOME66, and WikiPathways67. Enrichment was calculated relative to a set of background genes relevant for the experiment.\n\nThe transcriptomic dataset generated for this study is available in NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and is accessible through GEO Series Accession Number 255750.\n\nAll experiments detailed herein were repeated a minimum of three times to ensure rigor and reproducibility of the data. Data in all figures are presented as the mean+/ SEM, and were analyzed with Prism 8 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). Statistical significance of differences observed between the various experimental conditions was determined using one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Bonferroni idk correction for multiple comparisons. For all analyses,p<=0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Statistical significance is indicated in Figures with * forp<=0.05 and ** forp<=0.01.",
    "results": "To begin to define the impact that exposure to microgravity has upon NK cell function, we incubated NK 92MI cells for 48h in either: (1) conditions of normal gravity (1G) in a standard culture T flask; or (2) conditions of simulated microgravity (suG) using the NASA designed Synthecon rotating wall vessel (RWV) system and its associated high aspect ratio vessels (HARVs). At the end of the 48h incubation, NK 92MI cells were harvested and their cytotoxicity against two separate leukemic cell lines (K 562 erythroleukemia; MOLT 4 T ALL) was measured using a commercially available non radioactive cytotoxicity assay kit (), following the manufacturer's instructions which involved centrifugation and a 4h co incubation of the NK 92MI cells and leukemic cell lines under 1G. As seen in Fig.1, even a relatively brief (48h) exposure of NK 92MI cells to simulated microgravity (suG) dramatically reduced their ability to kill the erythroleukemic cell line K 562 (Fig.1A) at all measured E:T ratios, and it significantly reduced their killing of the T ALL cell line MOLT 4 (Fig.1B) at higher E:T ratios. A 48h exposure of NK 92MI cells to suG also reduced their killing of MOLT 4 cells at the lowest measured E:T ratio of 5:1, but significance was not achieved.\n\nNK 92MI cells were exposed to suG in a rotating HARV for 48 h and then plated with leukemic cell lines at various concentrations and incubated in normal gravity for 4 h. Cytotoxicity against both K 562 (A) and MOLT 4 (B) cell lines was reduced at all E:T ratios. n=3 (K 562) or n=4 (MOLT 4).\n\nWhile the NK 92MI cell line is a workhorse of the NK field, and it has been used in countless studies related to NK function and NK cytotoxicity against various tumors, it is an IL 2 independent permanent cell line, and as such its biology likely differs, at least in subtle ways, from that of primary NK cells. We, therefore, next performed identical studies using primary NK cells isolated from the peripheral blood of three different healthy adult human donors (volunteers were all males between 25 35years of age; blood was collected by a physician following informed consent, in accordance with an IRB approved by Wake Forest University Health Sciences) to assess whether a 48h exposure to suG would also impair the cytotoxic function of primary human NK cells. As can be seen in Fig.2, the cytotoxicity of primary NK cells from all (n=3) healthy donors was also significantly reduced against K 562 (Fig.2A,p<=0.01) and MOLT 4 (Fig.2B,p<=0.05) leukemic cell lines (E:T ratio=10:1) following a 48h exposure to suG, although the reduction in cytotoxicity was more pronounced against the K 562 line.\n\nPrimary human NK cells were isolated from three healthy adult donors and exposed for 48h to: (1) normal gravity (1G) in a standard flask; (2) normal gravity (1G) in a stationary horizontal HARV; or (3) suG in a rotating HARV. NK cells were then harvested, plated with K 562 and MOLT 4 leukemic cell lines at a 10:1 ratio, and incubated in normal gravity for 4h. Cytotoxicity against both leukemic cell lines was significantly reduced by a 48h exposure to suG. No significant differences were observed between tissue flasks and HARVs under normal gravity.n=2separate healthy donors for K 562 and n=3separate healthy donors for MOLT 4;combined results from 3 separate experiments are shown.\n\nFor the initial studies on NK 92MI and primary human NK cells, we followed a standard protocol for measuring cytotoxicity in which NK cells were exposed to suG for 48h, followed by centrifugation and subsequent coculture of NK cells with target cells under conditions of normal gravity for a period of 4h. Since it is well documented that dramatic changes in gene expression occur within seconds in response to changes in gravity27 30, we reasoned that the hypergravity experienced during centrifugation as well as the 4h incubation period with target cells under conditions of normal gravity likely prevented a truly accurate assessment of the impact microgravity would have on NK function in \"real time\" during spaceflight.\n\nTherefore, we next performed studies using a modified workflow that enabled us to maintain both the NK cells and the target tumor cells in a continuous state of microgravity throughout the entire assay period, to more accurately evaluate NK cell tumor surveillance and elimination during spaceflight and generate data that are essential for more precise astronaut cancer risk estimates. Results from the cytotoxicity assay performed in continuous suG are shown in Fig.3. As can be seen in this Figure, subjecting primary human NK cells to conditions of suG for 48h and then performing the entire cytotoxicity assay under continuous conditions of suG significantly (p<=0.01) reduced their cytotoxicity towards both K 562 and MOLT 4 leukemic cell lines. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity of primary NK cells towards both leukemic cell lines was nearly identical whether the NK cell were cultured under normal gravity in standard T flasks (1G Flask) or in stationary horizontal HARVs (1G HARV), suggesting the culture vessel's material and geometry had no appreciable effect on NK cytotoxicity.\n\nPrimary human NK cells were isolated from three healthy adult donors and exposed for 48h to: (1) normal gravity (1G) in a standard flask; (2) normal gravity (1G) in a stationary horizontal HARV; or (3) suG in a rotating HARV. K 562 or MOLT 4 leukemic cell lines were then added at a 10:1 ratio to the vessel in which the NK cells were growing and incubated for an additional 4h, either under 1G (flask and horizontal stationary HARV) or under suG (rotating HARV). Primary NK cell cytotoxicity against both leukemic cell lines was significantly reduced when the cytotoxicity assay was performed under conditions of continuous suG.n=2separate healthy donors for K 562 and n=3separate healthy donors for MOLT 4;combined results from 3 separate experiments are shown.\n\nAs shown in Fig.4, when the results of the two different methodologies we employed (traditional cytotoxicity assay vs maintaining suG throughout the entire assay procedure) regarding the impact suG exerts on human NK cytotoxicity towards T ALL (MOLT 4) are directly compared, it is readily apparent that maintaining suG throughout the entire assay procedure leads to a statistically significant (p<=0.05) further reduction in cytotoxicity relative to the traditional assay. This difference suggests that previous reports may actually have underestimated the true reduction in NK activity caused by microgravity. Importantly, our findings also indicate that NK cells at least partially regain cytotoxic function over a period of as little as 4h when returned to normal gravity. When coupled with our prior report of human T ALL in mice whose hematopoietic system was repopulated with human hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) exposed to Mars mission equivalent doses of GCR ions13, the marked reduction in cytotoxicity of NK cells against T ALL when maintained in conditions of suG raises the troubling possibility that the combined exposure to space radiation and conditions of microgravity may place astronauts at even greater risk of this malignancy during prolonged missions beyond LEO.\n\nPrimary human NK cells were isolated from three healthy adult donors and exposed for 48h to: (1) normal gravity (1G) in a standard flask; (2) normal gravity (1G) in a stationary horizontal HARV; or (3) suG in a rotating HARV. Cytotoxicity against the K 562 and MOLT 4 leukemic cell lines (at a 10:1) ratio was then assessed under standard 1G conditions or under conditions of continued suG to enable comparison of the impact preexposure vs continuous exposure to suG had on primary human NK cell function. Primary NK cell cytotoxicity against both leukemic cell lines was significantly further reduced when NK cells were pre exposed for 48h to suG and the cytotoxicity assay was performed under conditions of continuous suG compared to 48h pre exposure alone.n=2separate healthy donors for K 562 and n=3separate healthy donors for MOLT 4;combined results from 3 separate experiments are shown.\n\nInterestingly, the cytotoxicity towards K 562 cells did not differ significantly between the two assays (data not shown). The reasons for are not clear but could be a result of K 562 cells exhibiting reduced expression of HLA class I and heightened expression of multiple ligands for activating NK receptors, which makes them exceptionally susceptible to NK cell mediated cytotoxicity31,32. As such, even the continuous presence of conditions of suG throughout the entire assay procedure is not able to further abrogate the ability of NK cells to recognize and kill this optimized target cell line beyond the roughly 65% inhibition resulting from the 48h of pre incubation in conditions of suG.\n\nTo gain insight into the mechanisms by which exposure to suG reduces the ability of primary human NK cells to recognize and lyse hematological tumors, we performed RNA seq analysis on RNA isolated from the NK cells of 2 healthy human donors (these are 2 additional healthy donors,i.e., they are not derived from the group of 3 healthy donors whose NK cells were used for the preceding cytotoxicity studies) following 48h of culture under conditions of suG. For these studies, the NK cells were grown in the absence of tumor targets, as there was no way to separate the NK cells from the tumor targets for RNA isolation that would not have required centrifugation or other extensive manipulations that had the potential to alter the NK cell transcriptome. As can be seen in Fig.5, the NK cells from the two different donors clustered together as a function of whether they were cultured in normal gravity (1G) or suG by both PCA (Fig.5A) and heatmap (Fig.5B), and the expression levels of 2184 genes were significantly (p<0.05) up  or down regulated by >=1.5 fold as a result of culture in suG, as shown in the Volcano plot in Fig.5C.\n\nPrimary human NK cells were isolated from two healthy adult donors (Donor A and Donor B) and exposed for 48h to: (1) normal gravity (1G) in a stationary horizontal HARV; or (2) suG in a rotating HARV. RNA was then isolated and subjected to RNA seq to identify differentially expressed genes (DEG) between these two gravitational conditions.APrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) plot of the transcriptome of the NK cells from the two donors when cultured under suG or 1G.BHeatmap plot of the transcriptome of the NK cells from the two donors when cultured under suG or 1G.CVolcano plot of the transcriptome of the NK cells from the two donors when cultured under suG or 1G.\n\nLooking at specific examples of genes whose transcripts were differentially regulated by exposure to suG, expression of various CD1 isoforms has been shown to inhibit NK cell mediated killing33,34. In these prior studies, the CD1 isoforms to be tested were expressed on the target cells; however, our data show (Fig.6) that culture in suG leads to a marked induction of mRNA for CD1b, CD1c, CD1d, and CD1e in the NK cells themselves (p=2.21e 3, 8.43e 3, 7.79e 3, and 1.87e 3, respectively). Exposure to suG also led to a significantup regulationof the following transcripts (Fig.7): (1) CD3D (p=1.14e 3), which is consistent with the recently described NK2.4 subset of memory like NK cells that accumulates with aging and exhibits low expression of the TCR complex35; (2) CD5 (p=6.6e 3), a cell surface protein that has an inhibitory function in antigen receptor signaling and is not normally expressed on NK cells and would be expected to impair NK functionality36 38; (3) decay accelerating factor/CD55 (p=8.53e 3), a molecule whose expression has been shown to inhibit human NK cell cytotoxicity against hematological cancers39; (4) CD84 (p=0.01), engagement of which significantly dampens NK cell cytotoxicity40; (5) CD200 (p=0.02), the shedding of which in the tumor microenvironment leads to NK cell dysfunction and apoptosis41; (6) CD47 (p=0.05), a finding of particular relevance to the anti tumor function of NK cells, since prior studies have shown that CD47 may play an inhibitory role in NK cell mediated cytotoxicity against cancer cells42; (7) LAIR1 (p=0.01), a potent inhibitor of NK cytotoxicity43; (8) NFATC1 (p=0.02), a negative regulator of NK cell tumor immunosurveillance44; and (9) CD34 (p=7.6e 3), an antigen only present on the earliest precursors of the NK lineage45, suggesting that microgravity may provoke a regression of NK cells to an immature, undifferentiated stem like state, as has been reported with other cell types grown in microgravity46,47.\n\nBox plots of the relative expressions levels of the mRNA for CD1b, CD1c, CD1d, and CD1e in primary NK cells from two different healthy adult donors (Donor A and Donor B) cultured under suG or 1G.

Collectively, the differential expression of myriad genes that are intimately involved in NK cytotoxicity/function provides multiple viable mechanistic explanations for the marked reduction we observed in NK killing under conditions of suG. Interestingly, exposure to conditions of suG also led to marked (p=0.05) induction of CD8A expression in NK cells (Fig.9). Importantly, CD8+NK cells have been shown to suppress CD4+T cell activation and proliferation51, suggesting that microgravity may also indirectly impact the function of the acquired immune system via its effects on NK cells.\n\nBox plots of the relative expressions levels of selected mRNAs that are down regulated in primary NK cells from two different healthy adult donors (Donor A and Donor B) cultured under suG vs. 1G.

    "discussion": "Taken together, these data demonstrate that even fairly brief exposure to conditions of simulated microgravity (suG) markedly reduces the cytotoxicity of both the NK 92MI cell lines and primary human NK cells from 3 different donors towards two different hematological tumor cell lines (K 562 and MOLT 4). Furthermore, these studies are the first report in which a cytotoxicity assay was conducted in conditions of continuous suG, preventing any alterations to cells which may be caused by return to normal gravity or the hypergravity during centrifugation that is performed during standard cytotoxicity assays. While never addressed before in this setting, we reasoned that maintaining suG throughout the duration of the assay is critical to accurately assess the true impact microgravity exerts on NK cell function, as even a few seconds of exposure to altered gravitational forces can dramatically affect gene expression27 30. Our observation of the further reduction in NK cell killing of MOLT 4 (T ALL) cells when cytotoxicity assays are performed under continuous suG vs. the standard protocol validated our prediction and demonstrated that prior studies employing traditional assay protocols18 26likely underestimated the impact of microgravity on NK function. The fact that a significant further decrease in killing was not observed in continuous suG when K 562 cells were used as targets raises the possibility that the exclusive use of this optimized target cell line with its exquisite sensitivity to NK lysis has the potential to mask important yet subtle effects various stressors may exert on NK function and highlights the importance of including additional target cell lines in future studies. When combined with our prior report of human T ALL in mice repopulated with human HSC that had been exposed to Mars mission equivalent doses of GCR ions13, the further reduction in cytotoxicity of primary human NK cells against T ALL when maintained in conditions of suG raises the troubling possibility that the combined exposure to space radiation and conditions of microgravity may have the potential to increase astronaut risk of this hematological malignancy, and perhaps others, during prolonged missions beyond LEO. It is interesting to note that immunodeficient mice repopulated with human HSC do not generate robust numbers of human NK cells52unless the mice have multiple human cytokine genes knocked in to their genome (e.g., the so called MISTRG mice53). As such, our observation13of the development of human T ALL in the NSG mice repopulated with GCR exposed human HSC lends further support to the conclusions of our current studies implicating a role for NK function in the risk of spaceflight induced hematological malignancies, as the deficits we observe in human NK function due to exposure to microgravity may also have been present, at least to some degree, in the \"avatars\" of human hematopoiesis we used in our prior studies where they could potentially have played a role in the development of T ALL. Importantly from the standpoint of astronaut safety, RNA seq analysis performed on primary NK cells from two different healthy human donors revealed that multiple pathways that are central to NK function are altered by exposure to suG, paving the way for future studies to test agents designed to target these specific pathways to serve as much needed medical countermeasures that can mitigate the microgravity induced deficits in NK function, enabling astronaut immune systems to effectively recognize and eliminate any malignant clones that arise as a result mutations induced by exposure to space radiation.",
