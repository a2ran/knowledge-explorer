    "abstract": "This is the first study to isolate and characterizeF. oxysporumisolates from a built environment, as well as one that has been exposed to space. The characterization and analysis of these two genomes may have important implications for the medical, agricultural, and food industries as well as for the health of the crew who coinhabit the ISS with these strains.\n\nKEYWORDS:Fusarium, International Space Station, fungi, genomics",
    "methods": "Surfaces (1m2) were sampled on the ISS using premoistened 9 in. by 9 in. polyester wipes (ITW Texwipe, Mahwah, NJ) that were prepared as part of an ongoing microbial tracking study during flight sampling 3 (6 May 2016). Wipes were stored at room temperature (RT) before being brought back to Earth, 6days after sampling, where they were processed as described previously (63). Material from the wipes was plated, 100ul, on potato dextrose agar (PDA) supplemented with chloramphenicol (final concentration, 100ug/ml) and incubated at 25 degreesC for 7 days.Fusarium oxysporum, identified by morphology and ITS region sequencing, was isolated from the ISS dining table. The two isolates were designated ISS F3 and ISS F4.\n\nFreezer stocks of ISS F3/F4 were plated on potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates and incubated at 25 degreesC for 5days, at which time the entire plate was covered with fungal growth. The growth over the entire plate was scraped into a sterile mortar and pestle containing a small amount of liquid nitrogen. The colonies were ground into a powder and then transferred into PowerBead tubes from the MoBio PowerSoil DNA isolation kit (Qiagen, USA; catalog number 12888), and the extraction protocol was followed per the manufacturer's instructions, except for the last step, in which DNA was eluted in 80ul of solution C6 (i.e., elution buffer). DNA was stored at  20 degreesC until sent for sequencing.\n\nGenomic DNA was paired end sequenced (2x100bp) with a 350 bp insert size on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform by Macrogen (Rockville, MD, USA). Totals of 48 million reads for F3 and 42 million reads for F4 were generated. Trimmomatic on the Galaxy server (https://usegalaxy.org) was used to remove the sequencing adaptors (settings: maximum mismatch, 2; accuracy of the match between the two adaptor ligated reads, 30; accuracy of the match between any adaptor, 10) and to trim the leading and trailing ends (settings: minimum quality required to keep a base, 3). Postprocessed reads werede novoassembled using ABySS version 2.0.2 (19) using the default settings. Different k mer sizes ranging from 68 to 90 were tested in order to find the one that gave the highestN50score and lowest number of scaffolds/contigs, after assembly. The k mer size 86 gave the best results for both F3 and F4, and the resulting assemblies were used for downstream analyses.\n\nThe phylogeny of the newly identified strains was assessed by extracting the full length gene sequence of translation elongation factor 1 alpha (EF 1alpha) from each of the genomes using BLASTN. The sequences were aligned using MUSCLE with default parameters (64), and phylogeny was inferred with PhyML (65) (1,000 bootstraps; percent bootstrap confidence is shown in red numbers in the tree). The trees were visualized using ETE 3 (66). The effector clustering was done on only theF. oxysporumstrains, using the list of 104 curatedF. oxysporumeffector candidate genes and the same clustering method as described in the work of van Dam et al. (24). Briefly, 2.5 kb regions up  and downstream of aminiature impala(mimp) transposable element were scanned for potential open reading frames (ORFs) containing a signal peptide. This procedure was previously done by van Dam et al. (24) for 59 individual isolates ofF. oxysporum, and the resulting effector candidate genes were grouped and merged into a list. Obvious false positives and transposable elements were removed, and multiple instances of the same effector were reduced to one representative. This curated list represents the \"effectorome\" of a varied set of plant pathogenicformae specialesofF. oxysporum. Screening for the presence of the putative 104 effectors was done using BLASTN (as described above). A binary data matrix was generated containing presence (\"1\") or absence (\"0\"') of each candidate in each genome. This table was used as input for hierarchical clustering performed in R, using a Jaccard binary distance matrix and average linkage. The resulting matrix was visualized using the \"heatmap3\" package in R.\n\nThe sequences of the 10 phylogenetically informative loci used to compare ISS F3/F4 were extracted from the genomes using the sequences of these genes in the reference genome ofF. oxysporumf. sp.lycopersici4287. The sequences were kindly provided by Li Jun Ma from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. The loci and chromosomal locations from the reference genome are as follows: chromosome 1, DNA directed RNA polymerase III subunit RPC2 and RPB1; chromosome 4, minichromosome maintenance protein 3 and anaphase promoting complex subunit 1; chromosome 5, two hypothetical proteins, FOXG 1751.3 and 2073.3; chromosome 7, DNA directed RNA polymerase II subunit RPB2; chromosome 8, hypothetical protein FOXG 3560.3; and chromosome 9, clathrin heavy chain and DNA polymerase gamma (28).\n\nThe KMC2 k mer counter (29) tool was used to generate 50 bp long k mers from 65F. oxysporumgenomes that were downloaded from GenBank (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/genbank/fungi/Fusarium_oxysporum/) (see Table S1 inData Set S5in the supplemental material). The KMC2 program was also used to determine which of the k mers generated from each genome were unique to that genome. A subset of the unique k mers were chosen, based on number of occurrences (chosen if they appeared once, instead of multiple times within the genome) and the type of sequence (the sequence did not contain a lot of repeats and had a good balance of GC and AT ratios). Using command line BLAST (version ncbi blast 2.4.0+), the genomes of F3 and F4 were used as the query against the \"database\" of unique k mer sequences. For ISS  F3 or ISS F4 to be considered one of the 65F. oxysporumstrains, every k mer in the database belonging to a specific strain had to have a perfect match against a sequence in either the F3 or F4 genome.\n\nWe applied a reference based analysis method to determine the relatedness of F3 and F4 to the reference genome, Fo47, and to 5 otherF. oxysporumisolates. The list of these strains and the reasons for including them in the analysis are presented in Table S3 inData Set S5. These publicly available genomes were downloaded from the NCBI sequence read archive (SRA). SNP identification was carried out using PhaME (version 1.0.2) (67), which uses Nucmer for pairwise alignment of genomes. Evolutionary analyses and phylogenetic trees were constructed as part of the PhaME pipeline. The numbers of SNPs spanning the entire genome, in coding regions, and in noncoding regions were extracted from the PhaME output using a custom Perl script and plotted in Prism (version 7). In order to detect SNPs in the coding regions, a gff annotation file of the reference genome (Fo47) was supplied as input.\n\nThe genes of the assembled ISS F3/F4 genomes were predicted with the AUGUSTUS gene prediction program using default settings and trained againstFusariumgraminearum(30,68). The amino acid sequences of the predicted genes were uploaded into Blast2GO (https://www.blast2go.com) (69), and annotation was performed with blastp fast against the NCBI nonredundant database, set to the \"fungi\" taxonomy filter. The E value cutoff was set to <1.0E 10. Gene ontology classification and InterProScan were also performed with Blast2GO using the default settings.\n\nPredicted proteins that were annotated as polyketide synthases were further evaluated with the polyketide synthase database (35), which consists of amino acid sequences of PKSs from 12F. oxysporumstrains and 8 otherFusariumspecies. A blastp search was performed with F3 and F4 sequences, and a positive match was based on >95% identity and an E value of <1E 10.\n\nBiosynthetic gene clusters were predicted with the fungal version of antiSMASH (https://fungismash.secondarymetabolites.org). The input files were the (i) assembled whole genome nucleotide sequences and (ii) gff annotation file produced from AUGUSTUS. Default settings were used in the run.\n\nTheglp 4/sek 1mutant strain AU37 ofC. elegansobtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (http://www.cbs.umn.edu/research/resources/cgc) was used in the experiments.\n\nC. elegansAU37 nematodes were synchronized for the experiment as previously described (70). Synchronized nematodes were then grown onE. coliOP50 lawns until they reached the L3 L4 stage. Then nematodes (about 300 worms) were collected and washed 3 times in 10ml of M9 buffer (71) containing 50ug/ml kanamycin. On the last washing, worms were incubated in 10ml M9 buffer containing 50ug/ml kanamycin for 1h to clean the intestinal tube and surface of nematodes fromE. coli. After cleaning, nematodes were poured on plain agar plates (1.5% agar in water) to soak the kanamycin solution into agar. At this point, synchronized fasting nematodes were ready for transferring into experimental fungal conidium suspensions.\n\nFungal conidium suspensions were prepared by growing the fungal strains on PDA plates and incubating them at 25 degreesC for 7days, at which time the plate was overgrown with growth. Eight milliliters of ST solution (8.5g NaCl, 1ml Tween 80 in 1liter of water) was poured onto the plates, and a cotton swab was used to scrape all the moistened fungi off the plate. The liquid suspension on the plate was then transferred to a 50 ml Falcon tube, spun down at 3,500xgfor 5min, and washed 3 times with sterile PBS. The pellet was then resuspended in 5ml of sterile PBS. To count the number of conidia in the suspension, a 1/10 dilution was prepared using ST solution and conidia were counted using a hemocytometer under the 40x objective of a light microscope. Conidial stocks were diluted in PBS to 107conidia/ml prior to the experiment.\n\nTwenty microliters of 107 conidia/mlF. oxysporumspores were suspended in 1ml of 30% (vol/vol) brain heart infusion broth (BHI broth; Remel, USA) prepared by dilution of BHI broth in M9 buffer. For each conidium suspension, 60 worms were transferred from plain agar plates into 1ml of a conidium suspension and incubated for 1h at 25 degreesC without agitation. After incubation, the entire reaction volume of conidium suspension with worms was transferred to a 60 mm dish containing 2ml of M9 buffer with 50ug/ml kanamycin. Then, worms were collected by a micropipette and transferred to a 60 mm dish containing 3ml of M9 buffer with 50ug/ml kanamycin. This procedure was repeated 3 times using 3ml of fresh M9 buffer with 50ug/ml kanamycin in a 60 mm dish at each transfer. After final washing, 10 worms were transferred into each experimental 30 mm dish (3 dishes per one fungal strain conidium suspension) containing 2ml of 30% BHI broth and 50ug/ml kanamycin. Worms were incubated at 25 degreesC without agitation, and worm death was estimated at 17, 24, 44, and 50h after conidium exposure using an Olympus SZX16 microscope (x5 magnification) with a camera (Olympus DP30BW) for imaging.\n\nThis Whole Genome Shotgun project has been deposited at DDBJ/ENA/GenBank under the accession numbersQUWZ00000000(ISS F3) andQUXA00000000(ISS F4). The version described in this paper is the first version.",
    "results": "TwoF. oxysporumisolates (designated ISS F3 and ISS F4) were cultured from the dining table of the U.S. module of the ISS. The genomes were paired end sequenced (2x100bp) on the Illumina HiSeq platform with a 350 bp insert size, resulting in 48 million (ISS F3) and 42 million (ISS F4) reads. These paired end reads werede novoassembled into scaffolds (k mer size = 86) using ABySS (version 2.0.2) (19). The assembled genome size for ISS F3 was 53.6Mb and for ISS F4 was 53.8Mb, which is comparable to the genome size of the model strain,F. oxysporumf. sp.lycopersicistrain 4287 (59.9Mb) (20).Table1provides general assembly statistics of the draft genomes ofF. oxysporumISS F3 and ISS F4.\n\nGeneral assembly statistics for the draft genomes ofFusarium oxysporumISS F3/F4 strains\n\nThe conserved marker gene translation elongation factor 1 alpha (EF 1alpha) was used to determine the phylogenetic relatedness of ISS F3/F4 to 62 otherF. oxysporumstrains, belonging to variousformae speciales,and seven strains belonging to otherFusariumspecies included as outgroups, based on clonal (asexual) vertical inheritance. EF 1alpha allows for phylogenetic species recognition because it is applicable acrossFusariumand it is informative at or near the species level and orthologous across the genus (21). Based on EF 1alpha phylotyping,F. oxysporumcan be divided into 3 distinct clades with various clonal lineages within each clade (22,23). The phylogenetic tree inferred inFig.1Aclusters ISS F3/F4 into clade 3, belonging to a clonal lineage closely related to 4 other strains: three members ofF. oxysporumf. sp.lycopersiciand the non plant pathogenic biocontrol strain Fo47 (members of a clonal lineage have the same sequence of conserved genes). Three other isolates of interest are highlighted inFig.1Abecause they too had been isolated from harsh environments, two cultured from ISS grownZinnia hybridaplants that caused foliar, stem, and root rot (VEG 01C1 and VEG 01C2), and IMV00293, cultured at the site of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster 12years after the explosion. The ISSZ. hybridastrains fell into a different branch from ISS F3/F4 and were most closely related to IMV00293.\n\nPhylogenetic relationship of ISS F3/F4 among otherF. oxysporumisolates. (A) The phylogenetic tree constructed from EF 1alpha sequences of 62F. oxysporumisolates places ISS F3/F4 in clade 3, belonging to a clonal lineage shared by lycopersici_016, lycopersici_072, lycopersici_075, and Fo47. OtherFusariumspecies (bottom) were included to root the tree. The bootstrap confidence (in percent; 1,000 replicates performed) is shown in red numbers in the tree. (B) Presence/absence profiles of ISS F3/F4 with 62 other strains based on 104 candidate effector proteins. Colored boxes indicate the presence of a particular effector gene, with gray indicating its absence in the genome. The list of effector genes is shown inData Set S4.Formae specialesthat cause disease in the same host cluster together, as seen by the groupings of green (cucurbit infecting strains), red (tomato infecting strains), and yellow (banana infecting strains). Dark gray represents non plant pathogenic isolates, and pink represents strains isolated from or flown to the ISS. Blue represents other plant pathogens. ISS F3/F4 contained relatively few effector genes compared to the number found in the plant pathogens (green, red, yellow, and blue) and showed the most similar pattern (number and type) to Fo47, a non plant pathogenic soil isolate with a biocontrol function.\n\nF. oxysporumgenomes consist of a \"core\" set of housekeeping genes and an \"accessory\" genome which is not required for vegetative growth but contains most of, if not all, the genes that allow the fungus to invade and cause disease in a host plant (20). Utilizing 104 effector candidates, van Dam et al. were able to show that strains infecting the same host generally possess a similar set of effectors and that these effectors are often identical within aforma specialis(24). This indicates that the accessory genome, specifically the effector genes residing in these regions, can be used to identifyformae specialeswithin theF. oxysporumspecies complex (FOSC), including newly encountered strains (24).Figure1Bshows the hierarchical clustering of presence/absence patterns of 104 effector sequences in ISS F3/F4 along with 62 other strains. The effector profile of ISS F3/F4 was the most similar to Fo47 (a non plant pathogenic soil isolate that has been shown to exert a biocontrol function) (25) with similarities to another non plant pathogenic isolate, MN25, and CL57 (NRRL 26381), an isolate causing root rot in tomato, also known as NRRL 26381. The ISS F3/F4 strains do not contain as many effector genes as (almost) all of the plant pathogens examined and do not possess any of the SIX genes (see top panel ofFig.1B), which encode secreted fungal proteins that were first discovered in the xylem sap of infected tomato plants and have a well studied role in plant pathogenesis (26,27).\n\nFurther analyses were conducted to determine how closely related ISS F3 and ISS F4 were to each other. The sequences of 10 phylogenetically informative loci (28) were compared between the two strains, and for all 10 loci, the sequences were identical between ISS F3/F4. Second, a BLAST comparison was performed using contigs above 2kb for each strain. Using ISS F3 as the query, each of the 682 contigs matched a contig in ISS F4 with either 99% or 100% identity with an E value of 0. Last, when single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis was performed against the reference genome Fo47, ISS F3/F4 had the same single nucleotide variants. For this reason, it is believed that ISS F3/F4 are clonal derivatives of each other.\n\nBased on EF 1alpha phylogeny (Fig.1A) and the presence/absence of effector proteins (Fig.1B), ISS F3/F4 appeared to be the most closely related to Fo47. To determine whether the ISS strains were Fo47 or represented a distinct strain, twoin silicogenomic comparisons were conducted.\n\nThe KMC2 k mer counter (29) was used to generate 50 bp long k mers from 65F. oxysporumgenomes that were downloaded from GenBank (see Table S1 inData Set S5in the supplemental material). The k mers generated from each genome were compared against the k mers from all other genomes to find the ones that were specific to each of the 65 genomes analyzed. From all genome specific k mers that were identified, a subset was chosen from each genome to create theF. oxysporumk mer database. These sequences were chosen based on number of occurrences (chosen if they appeared once, instead of multiple times within the genome) and the type of sequence (the sequence did not contain a lot of repeats and had a good balance of GC and AT ratios). The sequences making up this database are listed inTableS2.\n\nF. oxysporumk mer database. The sequences shown represent the 50 bp k mer sequences that are unique to each strain and not present in the other 64 strains examined.

For example, all k mers generated for strain Fo47 in the database needed to match sequences in either the ISS F3 or  F4 genome 100% (i.e., 50 bp k mer/50 bp genome [no mismatches]) for ISS F3 or  F4 to be considered Fo47.\n\nNone of the Fo47 unique k mer sequences matched sequences in the ISS F3 or ISS F4 genome, and only 1 k mer from strainsradicis lycopersici26381 (CL57), UASWS AC1,lycopersiciFol074, andmelonisFom009 found an exact match. Based on the criteria above, ISS F3/F4 were not the same strain as Fo47 nor any of the other 64 strains tested.\n\nSNP genotyping was the secondin silicocomparative method used to determine the relatedness of the ISS isolates to that of Fo47. Using Fo47 as the reference genome, the number of SNPs in the genomes of ISS F3/F4 compared to Fo47 was calculated, along with other strains as a comparison. These additional strains are listed in Table S3 inData Set S5, along with the reasons for choosing them. Phylogenies of these isolates inferred using maximum likelihood from SNP sequences in coding regions across every genome indicate that they are distinct from Fo47 and the other strains included (Fig.2A). Similar results were obtained with SNPs across the entire genome (coding and noncoding regions) (data not shown). A summary of the total number of SNPs across the genome, the number of SNPs in coding regions, and the number of SNPs in noncoding regions is displayed inFig.2B. The total numbers of SNPs in ISS F3/F4 were 150,000 and 152,000, which are more thanlycopersiciFol016 andradicis lycopersici26381 (also known as CL57), which are well defined, characterized strains, known to be different than Fo47.\n\nSingle nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis comparing ISS F3/F4 to the reference genome Fo47. (A) Maximum likelihood tree constructed from SNPs found in the coding regions of the genomes of ISS F3, ISS F4, and 8 otherF. oxysporumstrains (see Table S3 inData Set S5for reasons for inclusion in analysis). ISS F3/F4 form their own clonal lineage distinct from Fo47 and the other strains. A similar tree was inferred when all SNPs across the genome were analyzed. (B) The frequency of SNPs across the entire genome (black), the noncoding region of the genome (purple), and the coding region of the genome (yellow) is summarized in the bar graph. Fol016 and 26381, well defined strains, known to be different than Fo47, had a lower frequency of SNPs than ISS F3/F4.\n\nUsing the gene prediction program AUGUSTUS (30), ISS F3 was predicted to contain 16,648 genes and ISS F4 had 16,729 genes. This number is very close to the predicted number of genes (17,735) for the model strain,F. oxysporumf. sp.lycopersici4287 (20,31). The predicted genes were annotated with BLAST2GO, and 47% of the genes in ISS F3 and 56% in ISS F4 could be matched to known proteins while the remaining genes were listed as hypothetical (Data Sets S1andS2). Among the predicted genes, 273 genes in ISS F3 and 76 genes in ISS F4 had no similarity to fungal genes in the NCBI database (Data Sets S1andS2) and could possibly represent novel, unidentified fungal proteins. Gene Ontology (GO) functional annotation was also performed with BLAST2GO, and 65% of the predicted genes in ISS F3 and 68% in ISS F4 could be assigned a function (Data Sets S1andS2). The most frequently represented GO functional assignments were metabolic and cellular processes (category: biological processes), catalytic activity and binding (category: metabolic function), and membrane and membrane part components (category: cellular component) (Fig.3A). A summary of the 50 most abundant GO terms in each of the 3 categories mentioned above is presented inFig.S1. Approximately 15% of the predicted genes were classified as enzymes, with hydrolases dominating followed by transferases (Fig.3B).\n\nSummary of gene ontology (GO) annotation of the predicted genes in ISS F3/F4. Predicted genes in ISS F3/F4 were predicted using AUGUSTUS and then annotated using Blast2GO. Functions could be assigned to 10,789 of the 16,648 genes in ISS F3 and 11,305 of the 16,729 genes in ISS F4. (A) Bar charts summarizing the most abundant GO terms for ISS F3.

NB, ISS F3/F4 had the same distributions of GO and enzyme class abundances, and thus, only ISS F3 is shown for simplicity.

Abundant protein domains in ISS F3/F4 were the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) domain, the Zn(2) C6 fungal type DNA binding domain, the fungal transcription factor domain, the ankyrin repeat containing domain, and the protein kinase domain (Fig.4A). The abundant protein families were the NAD(P) binding domain superfamily, MFS transporter superfamily, P loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase, Zn(2) C6 fungal type DNA binding domain superfamily, and the alpha/beta hydrolase fold (Fig.4B). A comparison was performed between the ISS strains isolated during this study and a non plant pathogenic biocontrol soil isolate (Fo47) and a clinical isolate (FOSC 3a). While the most abundant domains and families in ISS F3/F4 were also the most abundant ones in Fo47 and FOSC 3a, the collective proportions differed, with Fo47 and FOSC 3a more similar to each other than to ISS F3/F4 (Fig.4). There were also many domains and families that were present in Fo47 and FOSC 3a that were not found in the ISS F3/F4 genomes and vice versa (Fig.S2).Data Set S3shows the full list of protein domains and families present in each of the different strains and the relative abundances of each within each genome.\n\nAnnotation of protein domains and protein families with InterProScan. Protein families were classified and domains were predicted using InterProScan. The heat map shows the relative abundances of the top 100 most abundant domains (A) and families (B) in ISS F3/F4, in addition to a non plant pathogenic soil isolate (Fo47) and a clinical isolate, isolated from a patient with fusariosis (FOSC 3a). Red represents high relative abundances, and green represents low relative abundances.\n\nAnnotation of protein domains and protein families with InterProScan. Protein families were classified and domains predicted using InterProScan. Heat maps in panels A and B capture the presence/absence profiles of all 2,468 domains and 3,061 families detected in the 4 strains. Gray bars indicate that a specific domain (A) or family (B) was absent in a specific genome. Of the family and domains that are present, the color gradient shows the relative abundances within the genome, with light red being the most relatively abundant and light green being the least relatively abundant.

Different PKSs catalyze the synthesis of structurally distinct polyketides, and to date 52 PKSs have been identified inFusariumwith 16 found inF. oxysporum(35).\n\nDue to the importance of PKS in SM production, predicted proteins composed of PKS domains, based on the InterProScan results above, were further studied to identify which PKSs (and the resulting polyketides) ISS F3/F4 have the potential to express. The amino acid sequences of ISS F3/F4 proteins with PKS domains were compared using BLAST against a database composed of PKSs identified from 12 strains ofF. oxysporumand 9 otherFusariumspecies (35).\n\nThe BLAST searches revealed the presence of 11 PKSs in the genomes of ISS F3/F4 which have all been detected in otherF. oxysporumstrains (Fig.5). Compared to the 12F. oxysporumstrains, the presence/absence PKS profile of ISS F3/F4 best resembled that of Fo47, followed by FOSC 3a (Fig.5). In addition to the 11 PKS proteins identified in ISS F3/F4, there were two proteins with ketoacyl synthase domains that did not match anything in the database and could possibly represent novel, yet unidentifiedFusariumPKSs.\n\nPresence/absence profile of polyketide synthases (PKSs) detected in the genomes of ISS F3/F4. The sequences of predicted genes that had a ketoacyl synthase domain (one of 3 essential domains in polyketide synthases [PKSs]) were compared with BLAST against a PKS database (35) to determine which PKSs ISS F3/F4 had the ability to produce. Eleven PKSs found in ISS F3/F4 are also present in 12 otherF. oxysporumspecies that have been previously studied (35). However, there were two additional PKSs, unkA and unkB, in ISS F3/F4 that did not have any matches in the database. The first column represents the PKS, the last column shows the polyketide that the PKS makes (if known), and the middle columns indicate theF. oxysporumstrains. Colored boxes indicate the presence of a specific PKS in the genome.

Amino acid sequences for the unknown PKSs in ISS F3 can be found inData Set S1(g14942 and g11694), and those for ISS F4 can be found inData Set S2(g15849 and g12099). NB, the sequences are identical between ISS F3/F4.\n\nA more extensive SM assessment was performed with antiSMASH, which identified 47 biosynthetic gene clusters in the genome of ISS F3 and 46 in ISS F4. To put this finding into perspective, 44 biosynthetic gene clusters were identified in Fo47 while 47 clusters were present in the FOSC 3a. All four strains had biosynthetic gene clusters in their genomes that are involved in the production of type 1 polyketides, nonribosomal peptides, indoles, terpenes, and polyketide/nonribosomal peptide hybrids. While ISS F3, ISS F4, and Fo47 had clusters involved in type III polyketide production, FOSC 3a did not appear to have that machinery in its genome. A summary of the biosynthetic gene clusters detected in the ISS F3, ISS F4, Fo47, and FOSC 3a genomes is shown inFig.S3.\n\nA comparison of biosynthetic gene clusters inF. oxysporumstrains. Biosynthetic gene clusters, and thus the ability to produce secondary metabolites, were analyzed in ISS F3/F4 using antiSMASH. Included for comparison were the biosynthetic gene clusters in Fo47 (a non plant pathogenic soil isolate) and FOSC 3a (a clinical isolate). The boxes with numbers listed to the right of the strain name indicate the number of clusters in the genome for that specific type (i.e., for T1pks there were 7 clusters in strain ISS F3). The letters indicate the name of the compound produced or the name of the polyketide synthase (PKS) or nonribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS).

UtilizingF. oxysporumstrain 4287 knockout mutants that exhibit altered virulence in tomato plants, it was shown that certain virulence factors essential in plant pathogenesis were dispensable in mammalian pathogenesis and vice versa (36). This raises the possibility that certain phytopathogens could also be virulent in humans depending on their health status. This is concerning given the fact that a recent study on the impact of space on fungal pathogenesis has shown thatAspergillus fumigatusisolates cultured from ISS surfaces were more virulent in a zebrafish model of invasive aspergillosis than Earth based clinical isolates (37).\n\nThis prompted the examination of the virulence potential of ISS F3/F4 in an immunocompromised (MAPKK deficient)C. elegansmodel of invasive fusariosis. Included for comparison was anF. oxysporumstrain, IMV00293, isolated in the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster, flown to the ISS and grown for 12days (\"293gr\"), and grown concomitantly on Earth (\"293sp\").\n\nFigure6demonstrates the effect of five strains ofF. oxysporumon mortality ofC. elegansAU37. Kaplan Meier survival curves ofC. elegansanalyzed with the log rank (Mantel Cox) test demonstrated that the virulence ofF. oxysporumISS F4 was significantly greater than other strains (P< 0.0001) (Fig.6A). The culturing conditions for fungal growth such as growing without antibiotic or with antibiotic used to prepare conidia did not affect ISS F4 killing ability (P= 0.6888). The majority of worms died due toF. oxysporumhyphae piercing through the worm body (Fig.6B); however, ISS F4 virulence was attributed to both hypha  and non hypha related killing (Fig.6C), whereas ISS F3 virulence was attributed solely to hypha related mortality (Fig.6D). The hypha related killing of ISS F4 was still significantly greater than other strains (P= 0.0129) (Fig.6B). Importantly, while ISS F3, 293gr, and 293sp had less killing capability than ISS F4, they should be still considered virulent, as their related mortality for worms reached 50% at 50h. To note, there were no differences in mortality between 293gr and 293sp, indicating that growth on the ISS (12days) did not change the virulence of this strain.Figure7shows microscopic images ofC. elegansworms with hypha penetration, 22h and 46h after exposure to ISS F4 conidia.\n\nVirulence ofFusarium oxysporumstrains inC. elegansAU37 model.

(C and D) Comparison of hypha related and total deaths ofC. eleganscaused by ISS F4 (C) and ISS F3 (D). Total deaths ofC. eleganscaused by ISS F4 were significantly higher than the deaths associated with hyphae piercing through the body (P= 0.0102,n=90, log rank [Mantel Cox] test). There is no statistical difference between total and hypha related deaths caused by ISS F3 (P= 0.2465,n=90). NB, 293sp is the IMV00293 strain that was isolated from Chernobyl and grown on the ISS for 12days, and 293gr is IMV00293 that was concomitantly grown for 12days on Earth.\n\nImages ofC. elegansAU37 with hyphae ofF. oxysporumISS F4 piercing through worm body.

    "discussion": "This study presents the genomic analysis of twoF. oxysporumisolates, cultured from the ISS, during an ongoing microbial tracking study. The phylogenetic placement of these two strains based on EF 1alpha nucleotide sequence and whole genome SNPs shows that they are within the genetic variation of terrestrial strains and that their ability to thrive in the space environment was not contingent on enhanced genetic variation.\n\nF. oxysporumstrains are well known for their plant pathogenicity, and for successful infection of its plant host, effector proteins are secreted from the fungus that aid in the colonization process. Performing disease assays to determine host specificity is both laborious and time consuming; however, a recent molecular screening method based on 104 effector proteins was developed by van Dam et al. which can predict host specificity inF. oxysporum(24). The presence/absence of these effector proteins in ISS F3/F4 was determined and compared to 62 other strains from a variety offormae speciales. The ISS strains contained relatively few candidate effector genes compared to phytopathogens, with numbers similar to that detected in two non plant pathogenic strains, Fo47 and MN14. The ISS isolates also did not contain any of the 14secretedinxylem (SIX) effector genes, which encode cysteine rich secreted proteins that appear to manipulate host defenses to promote infection (38). Based on the effector content, it is unlikely that ISS F3/F4 are plant pathogens. VEG 01C1 and VEG 01C2, isolated fromZ. hybridaplants grown on the ISS and whole genome sequences (39) also displayed relatively few effector genes (Fig.1B) and were unable to infect healthyZ. hybridaplants (G. Massa, personal communication).\n\nBased on effector content and EF 1alpha phylogeny, ISS F3/F4 appeared to be the most closely related to Fo47, a non plant pathogenic soil isolate known for its biocontrol properties. Based on the number of SNPs across the genome, the phylogeny inferred using maximum likelihood from SNP sequences in both coding and noncoding regions, and the k mer analysis, ISS F3/F4 were not Fo47 or identical to any of the 65 strains compared in this study. Thus, it appears that these ISS isolates represent a genomically unique strain, which has not yet been identified and characterized to date.\n\nThe ISS is a hermetically sealed system, closed off from its surrounding environment, with microbial introduction being of terrestrial origin from astronauts and payloads. ISS F3/F4 were most likely introduced in the same fashion, so it begs the question why they had been identified only on the ISS and not on Earth, where 150formae specialeshave already been characterized (2). One hypothesis is that ISS F3/F4 are present in relatively low abundances on Earth but were selected because of their ability to withstand ISS associated environmental pressures such as increased radiation, which compared to terrestrial indoor buildings, is 100 times greater. In a recent study by Byrne et al., it was found thatEscherichia colideveloped extreme resistance to ionizing radiation, comparable to that observed withDeinococcus radiodurans, with mutations in only 9 genes, all of which happen to be involved in radiation resistance (40). When these mutations were repaired, resistance was lost and the cells became sensitive to radiation (40). This paper showed for the first time that evolution of resistance may occur via genetic adaptation rather than passive mechanisms based on changes in cellular proteins. We therefore hypothesized that based on the sequences of five genes known to have a role in radiation resistance in fungi, ISS F3/F4 would appear to be more closely related to IMV00293 (Chernobyl isolate) and VEG 01C1/VEG 01C2 (ISSZ. hybridaisolates) (as they are strains also isolated from high radiation environments) compared to 64 otherF. oxysporumstrains. An inferred maximum likelihood tree was constructed from concatenated sequences ofrad54,rad53,rad51,rad2, andphr1(a photolyase) found in ISS F3, ISS F4, IMV00293, VEG 01C1, VEG 01C2, and 64 otherF. oxysporumstrains. The branching observed with the radiation resistance genes was similar to that observed with EF 1alpha in which ISS F3/F4 grouped together, apart from IMV00293, VEG 01C1, and VEF 01C2, which grouped together, with all five isolates being within the genetic variation of the 64 other strains included (seeFig.S4in the supplemental material). A proteomics approach may provide more insight into whether ISS F3/F4 have a selective advantage for survival on the ISS and what that may entail.\n\nSequence comparison of radiation resistance genes among 69F. oxysporumstrains. An inferred maximum likelihood tree was constructed from concatenated sequences ofrad54,rad53,rad51,rad2, andphr1(a photolyase), genes that have been shown to play a role in radiation resistance in fungi.FusariumproliferatumandFusarium fujikuroiwere used to root the tree. Since ISS F3, ISS F4, IMV00293, VEG 01C1, and VEG 01C2 were all cultured from radiation rich environments, it was hypothesized that they would share similar sequences in these genes, distinct from the other 65F. oxysporumstrains. However, as the tree shows, this was not the case.

Overall, the relative abundances of GO categories for ISS F3/F4 were similar to that observed in FOSC 3a, a clinical isolate, and Fo47, a biocontrol, non plant pathogenic strain. However, there were differences in the relative abundances and presence/absence of protein domains and families between ISS F3/F4 and FOSC 3a and Fo47, highlighting the uniqueness of these strains. One such difference was the higher relative abundance of genes encoding polyketide synthase domains in ISS F3/F4. Each PKS makes a unique polyketide, which collectively represent structurally diverse natural products with commercial significance for the pharmaceutical industries (41). A testament to its importance is reflected in the annual sales of pharmaceuticals derived from polyketides, which routinely reach $20 billion (42). For example, the anticancer drugs tetracycline and doxorubicin, the cholesterol lowering drug lovastatin, the antibiotics erythromycin and rifamycin, and the fungicide strobilurin are all polyketides that have been isolated from either bacteria or fungi (43). A BLAST search against a PKS database (35) showed that ISS F3/F4 had the genomic machinery to produce 13 polyketides, 11 of which have been found in otherF. oxysporumstrains. The two sequences in ISS F3/F4 that did not have any matches in the PKS database did matchF. oxysporumhypothetical proteins in NCBI. A more extensive analysis using proteomics and metabolomics will be performed to elucidate the natural product repertoire of ISS F3/F4.\n\nF. oxysporum, though a well known plant pathogen, may cause various infections in humans and is a cause of emerging infections in immunodeficient patients (44 46). Vertebrate and nonvertebrate models are well established to test pathogens for their potential virulence (36,47 49). For virulence testing ofF. oxysporum, a host is usually immunosuppressed to make it susceptible to fungal infection (50). Symptoms of disseminated fusariosis caused byF. oxysporumare remarkably similar between animals and humans. They include development of invasive structures, including hypha microconidia and chlamydospores, causing massive colonization of organs, and which can cause thrombosis and necrosis (4,50,51). The nonvertebrate hostC. elegans, a free living soil nematode, is one of the most useful models to study the virulence of fungi and is well established by many researchers (52 54).C. eleganshas an innate immune response mechanism that is activated in the response to pathogens, including fungi (55,56). A key component of theC. elegansimmune response is the p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (57). SEK 1 encodes a mitogen activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK) in this pathway and thus plays a vital role in pathogen resistance inC. elegans(58). For this reason, SEK 1 mutants are considered \"immunocompromised\" worms. Matricidal hatching of progeny inside the parent worms occurs in SEK 1 deficientC. elegans, and therefore, a mutation inglp 4, a locus required for normal proliferation of the germ line (59), is required to avoid bias effects due to progeny hatching. Theglp 4mutants are sterile at the restrictive temperature of 25 degreesC, at whichC. elegansexperiments are performed.\n\nUsing theglp 4/sek 1mutant strain AU37 ofC. elegansobtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center, we observed that ISS F4 was the most virulent, even compared to ISS F3, despite the fact that ISS F3/F4 have very similar genomes and initially were thought to be clonal derivatives of each other. Since ISS F4 demonstrated killing ability by both hypha piercing related and  unrelated mechanisms, it is likely that it produces secreted virulence factors. It is known that secreted proteins such as RP 1 like (60) and secreted in xylem (SIX) proteins (61), which are regulated byFusariumtranscription factor 1 (FTF1) (62), are required for full virulence ofF. oxysporum. Further work is required to determine if there are differences in production and regulation of the secreted factors between ISS F3/F4 strains and if time dependent exposure to the ISS environment may affect this regulation.",
