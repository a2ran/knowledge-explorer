    "abstract": "Tissues and organs provide the structural and biochemical landscapes upon which microbial pathogens and commensals function to regulate health and disease. While flat two dimensional (2 D) monolayers composed of a single cell type have provided important insight into understanding host pathogen interactions and infectious disease mechanisms, these reductionist models lack many essential features present in the native host microenvironment that are known to regulate infection, including three dimensional (3 D) architecture, multicellular complexity, commensal microbiota, gas exchange and nutrient gradients, and physiologically relevant biomechanical forces (e.g., fluid shear, stretch, compression).\n\nKEYWORDS:3 D, 3D, RWV, rotating wall vessel, gut on a chip, host microbe interaction, host pathogen interactions, mechanotransduction, organ on a chip, organoid",

    "conclusion": "Over the past 2 decades, a multidisciplinary consortium of researchers has been creative in developing 3 D intestinal models of increasing complexity that better mimic the biological, chemical, and physical microenvironments of the endogenous tissue for studying host microbe interactions. These models have been developed using a variety of approaches and are being applied to understand the dynamic relationship between the host, pathogens, and commensals that dictate infection outcome and for development of new treatment/prevention strategies. Collectively, these models have ushered in a new era for infectious disease research by offering predictivein vitrotranslational platforms. Indeed, the establishment of 3 D intestinal models and their application as human surrogates for infectious disease research have provided specific examples of how the study of microbial pathogenesis can be advanced by using appropriate, biologically meaningful models.\n\nWe are still in the infancy of learning how to build more realistic 3 D tissue models, and there remain an endless number of questions and hypotheses to test about how infection actually happens in the body. Continued model advancement to better recapitulate thein vivotissue microenvironment coupled with the application of multiple 3 D model systems will lead to increased translation of research discoveries to practical and significant outcomes. Such advances will be pivotal for the success of personalized medicine approaches using patient specific normal and diseased cells and of incorporation of the full repertoire of immune cells to predict clinical correlates of protection for vaccine development.\n\nToward this goal, we must deeply comprehend 3 D tissue/organ structure and function, the associated microenvironment, and the microorganisms to be studied. It is likewise important that we are aware of and acknowledge the rich history and work of researchers who have long applied 3 D tissue modeling to study host pathogen interactions. Accordingly, we should revisit past research in the field to help us understand and guide our direction. While it remains a daunting task to gain a complete understanding of infectious disease, the alignment of multidisciplinary research teams dedicated to the establishment of 3 D models that reconstruct the architecture and function of thein vivoorgan and their application for host pathogen interaction studies make this an exciting time to be a scientist!"
