    "abstract": "Leptin deficientob/obmice are morbidly obese and exhibit low total bone mass and mild osteopetrosis. In order to disassociate the skeletal effects of leptin deficiency from those associated with morbid obesity, we evaluated bone mass, architecture, gene expression, and indices of bone turnover in wild type (WT) mice,ob/obmice fedad libitum(ob/ob),andob/obmice pair fed to WT mice (pair fedob/ob). Mice were maintained at 32 degreesC (thermoneutral) from 6 to 18 weeks of age to minimize differences in resting energy expenditure.ob/obmice were heavier, had more abdominal white adipose tissue (WAT), and were hyperglycemic compared to WT mice. Femur length, bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density, and midshaft femur cortical thickness were lower inob/obmice than in WT mice. Cancellous bone volume fraction was higher but indices of bone formation and resorption were lower inob/obcompared to WT mice; reduced bone resorption inob/obmice resulted in pathological retention of calcified cartilage. Pair fedob/obmice were lighter, had lower WAT, uterine weight, and serum glucose thanob/obmice. Similarly, femoral length, BMC, and cortical thickness were lower in pair fedob/obmice compared toob/obmice, as were indices of cancellous bone formation and resorption. In contrast, bone marrow adiposity, calcified cartilage and cancellous bone volume fraction were higher at one or more cancellous sites in pair fedob/obmice compared toob/obmice. These findings demonstrate that the skeletal abnormalities caused by leptin deficiency are markedly attenuated in morbidly obeseob/obmice.\n\nKeywords:obesity, histomorphometry, microcomputed tomography, dual energy absorptiometry",
    "methods": "The experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Four week old femaleob/ob(n=20) and homozygous WT (+/+) littermate (n=11) mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). At 6 weeks of age, all animals were transferred from normal room temperature (22 degreesC) to thermoneutral temperature (32 degreesC) and maintained at thermoneutrality on a 12 h light, 12 h dark cycle for the duration of study (12 weeks). Food (Teklad 8604, Harlen Labratories, Indianapolis, IN) and water were providedad libitumto WT mice (n=11) and a group ofob/obmice (n=10). A second group ofob/obmice (n=10) was pair fed to the WT mice; theob/obmice were fed an amount of food equivalent to the group mean for WT mice.\n\nFood consumption was measured daily in WT mice and weekly in thead libitum fedob/obmice. Body weight was recorded weekly in all mice. The fluorochrome declomycin (20 mg/kg, Sigma, St Louis, MO) was administered at study initiation and the fluorochrome calcein (20 mg/kg, Sigma, St Louis, MO) was administered 4 days and 1 day prior to sacrifice to label mineralizing bone. All mice were fasted overnight. The mice were then anesthetized with 2 3% isofluorane delivered in oxygen, bled by cardiac puncture, and glucose measured using a glucometer (Life Scan Inc, Milpitas, CA). Serum was collected and stored at  80 degreesC for measurement of global markers of bone turnover. Uteri and abdominal white adipose tissue (WAT) were excised and weighed. Femora and lumbar vertebrae were removed and stored in 70% ethanol for analysis using dual energy absorptiometry (DXA), microcomputed tomography (uCT), and histomorphometry. Tibiae were removed, cleaned of soft tissue, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at  80C for mRNA isolation and gene expression analysis.\n\nSerum osteocalcin was measured using mouse Gla osteocalcin High Sensitive EIA kit from Clontech (Mountain View, CA). Serum CTx was measured using mouse CTx ELISA kit from Life Sciences Advanced Technologies (Saint Petersburg, FL).\n\nFemoral bone mineral content (BMC, mg), area (cm2), and bone mineral density (BMD, g/cm2) were determinedex vivousing DXA (Piximus, Lunar Corp., Madison, WI, USA).\n\nuCT was used for nondestructive three dimensional evaluation of bone microarchitecture (Bouxsein, et al. 2010). Femora and lumbar vertebrae were scanned in 70% ethanol using a Scanco uCT40 scanner (Scanco Medical AG, Basserdorf, Switzerland) at a voxel size of 12 x 12 x 12 um (55 kVpx ray voltage, 145 uA intensity, and 200 ms integration time). Evaluations were conducted with filtering parameters sigma and support set to 0.8 and 1, respectively. Bone segmentation was performed at a threshold of 245 (scale, 0 1000) determined empirically. Total femur was evaluated followed by evaluation of cortical bone in the midshaft femur and cancellous bone in the distal femur metaphysis and epiphysis. Automated contouring was used to delineate cortical bone from non bone. Following, all cortical slices were examined visually for potential inclusion of cancellous struts originating from the endocortex (extremely rare at this site) and manually removed when present. For cortical bone, 20 slices (0.24 mm) of bone were evaluated, and cross sectional tissue volume (cortical and marrow volume, mm3), cortical volume (mm3), marrow volume (mm3), and cortical thickness (um) measured. Polar moment of inertia was determined as a surrogate measure of bone strength in torsion. Architectural parameters are expressed using standard 3 dimensional nomenclature. For the femoral metaphysis, 40 slices (480 um) of cancellous bone were evaluated. The entire cancellous compartment was assessed in the femoral epiphysis. Analysis of lumbar vertebra included the entire region of cancellous bone between the cranial and caudal growth plates. Manual contouring was used to delineate cancellous from cortical bone in the femur metaphysis, femur epiphysis, and vertebral body. Cancellous bone measurements in femur and lumbar vertebra included bone volume fraction (bone volume/tissue volume, BV/TV, %), connectivity density (mm 3), trabecular number (mm 1), trabecular thickness (mm) and trabecular separation (mm) (Thomsen, et al. 2005).\n\nThe histological methods used here have been described in detail (Iwaniec, et al. 2008). In brief, the distal femur was dehydrated in graded series of ethanol and xylene and embedded undecalcified in modified methyl methacrylate. Sections (4 um thick) were cut with a vertical bed microtome (Leica/Jung 2165) and affixed to slides precoated with a 1% gelatin solution. Sections were mounted unstained for measurement of fluorochrome labels. For cell based measurements, sections were stained for tartrate resistant acid phosphatase and counterstained with toluidine blue (Sigma, St Louis). All data were collected using the OsteoMeasure System (OsteoMetrics, Inc., Atlanta, GA). The sampling site for the distal femoral metaphysis was located 0.25 1.25 mm proximal to the growth plate. The entire cancellous compartment was evaluated in the distal femoral epiphysis and body of lumbar vertebra.\n\nFluorochrome based measurements of bone formation included: (1) mineralizing perimeter (mineralizing perimeter/bone perimeter: cancellous bone perimeter covered with double plus half single label normalized to bone perimeter, %), (2) mineral apposition rate (the distance between two fluorochrome markers that comprise a double label divided by the 3 day interlabel interval, um/day), and (3) bone formation rate (bone formation rate/bone perimeter: calculated by multiplying mineralizing perimeter by mineral apposition rate normalized to bone perimeter, um2/um/y).\n\nDeclomycin label retained in the regions of interest (mm label/mm2tissue area) in the distal femur epiphysis and lumbar vertebra was measured as a dynamic index of bone resorption inob/oband pair fedob/obmice. This method is based on the principle that declomycin label was incorporated into bone at equivalent rates in both groups ofob/obmice when the fluorochrome was administered prior to treatment initiation and differences measured at study termination reflect the effect of treatment on resorption of the fluorochrome labeled bone. This method has been described (Westerlind, et al. 1997). We did not measure declomycin label in WT mice because almost no label was retained in this group at termination of study.\n\nCell based measurements included osteoblast perimeter, osteoclast perimeter, adipocyte number, and adipocyte area. Osteoblast perimeter was determined as a percentage of total bone perimeter lined by a palisade of plump cuboidal cells located immediately adjacent to the thin layer of osteoid in direct physical contact with the bone perimeter (osteoblast perimeter/bone perimeter, %). Osteoclast perimeter was determined as the percentage of cancellous bone perimeter covered by multinucleated (two or more nuclei) cells with acid phosphatase positive (red stained) cytoplasm (osteoclast perimeter/bone perimeter, %). Cartilage area in the distal femur metaphysis and epiphysis was measured and expressed as % cancellous bone area. The intense metachromatic (purple) staining of proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans with toluidine blue was used to identify cartilage within trabeculae. Adipocyte number and area were also measured and expressed as bone marrow adiposity (tissue area occupied by adipocytes: adipocyte area/tissue area, %), and adipocyte density (number of adipocytes/mm2). Adipocytes were identified morphologically as large (> 75 um2) circular or oval shaped cells bordered by a prominent cell membrane and lacking cytoplasmic staining due to alcohol extraction of intracellular lipids during processing. This method was previously validated by fat extraction and analysis (Menagh, et al. 2010). All histomorphometric data are expressed using standard 2 dimensional nomenclature (Dempster, et al. 2013) to distinguish 2 dimensional histomorphometric measurements from 3 dimensional uCT measurements.\n\nTibiae were pulverized with a mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen and then further homogenized in Trizol (Invitrogen; Valencia, CA). Total RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer's protocol, and mRNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using SuperScript III First Strand Synthesis SuperMix for qRT PCR (Invitrogen). The expression of 84 genes related to osteogenic differentiation was determined using the Mouse Osteogenesis RT2Profiler PCR Array (Qiagen; Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Gene expression was normalized to GAPDH and relative quantification was determined using the Ct method using RT2Profiler PCR Array Data Analysis software version 3.5 (Qiagen).\n\nMean responses of individual variables were compared between the WT,ob/ob, and pair fedob/obgroups using separate one way analysis of variance (ANOVA), with Tukey's procedure for pairwise multiple comparisons. The required conditions for valid use of ANOVA models were assessed using Levene's test for homogeneity of variance, plots of residuals versus fitted values, normal quantile plots, and the Anderson Darling test of normality. A modified F test was used when the assumption of equal variance was violated, with Welch's two sample t test used for pairwise comparisons (Welch 1951). The Kruskal Wallis nonparametric test was used when only the normality assumption was violated, in which case the Wilcoxon Mann Whitney test was used for pairwise comparisons. Longitudinal data on body weight were analyzed using a random intercept linear mixed model that allowed distinct linear rates of change for the WT and pair fedob/obgroups and a quadratic time trend for theob/obgroup. The Hommel method for maintaining the family wise error rate at 5% was used to adjust for multiple comparisons (Hommel 1988). Data analysis was performed using R version 2.12. Gene expression analysis was performed using RT2Profiler PCR Array Data Analysis version 3.5 (Qiagen). Gene expression is reported as mean fold change. All other data are reported as mean +/  SE.",

Compared to WT mice, expression levels of 24 genes were altered inob/obmice (7 higher and 17 lower) and 26 genes in pair fedob/obmice (10 higher and 16 lower). The expression levels of 14 genes were altered in common inob/oband pair fedob/obmice. Compared toob/obmice, expression levels of 11 genes (3 higher and 8 lower) were altered in pair fedob/obmice.ob/obmice exhibited reductions in several key genes related to osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation and function, including Sp7/osterix ( 2.5 fold), NfB1 ( 1.2 fold), alkaline phosphatase (Alpl) ( 1.5 fold), Itgam (CD11b) ( 1.3 fold) and osteocalcin (Bglap) ( 1.8 fold).ob/obmice also exhibited reductions in genes related to cartilage formation and maturation, including col2a1 ( 1.5 fold) and col10a1 ( 1.7 fold).

    "discussion": "We investigated the contribution of excessive weight gain to the skeletal phenotype of leptin deficientob/obmice. Mice were housed at 32 degreesC and a group ofob/obmice was pair fed to WT mice. Housing mice at 32 degreesC, which is within the thermoneutral range for WT andob/obmice, was expected to minimize differences in resting energy expenditure and pair feedingob/obmice to WT mice was expected to equalize energy intake (Knehans and Romsos 1982;Rafael and Herling 2000). The parallel increase in body weight gain in WT mice andob/obmice pair fed to WT mice over the 12 week duration of study demonstrates the efficacy of this approach for preventing development of morbid obesity in leptin deficient mice.\n\nConsistent with earlier studies (Ealey et al. 2006;Hamrick et al. 2004;Iwaniec et al. 2007;Williams et al. 2011),ob/obmice exhibited a mosaic skeletal phenotype associated with decreased bone formation due to reduced osteoblast number and activity, and defective osteoclast function. Femurs fromob/obmice were smaller and had thinner cortices than those from WT mice. Furthermore, serum osteocalcin levels, mRNA levels for osteocalcin and SP7 (osterix), osteoblast perimeter and dynamic indices of bone formation were lower inob/obmice than in WT mice. However, cancellous bone volume fraction in both distal femur and lumbar vertebra was higher in theob/obmice. The higher cancellous bone volume fraction was associated with (1) greatly reduced serum CTx levels, (2) reductions in mRNA levels for NFKB, Itgam and Icam1, (3) retention of calcified cartilage, and (4) retention of fluorochrome label administered at study initiation, all indicative of a defect in bone resorption. Osteoclast perimeter was either unaffected (distal femur metaphysis and lumbar vertebra) or increased (distal femur epiphysis), indicating that reduced bone resorption inob/obmice was not due to an inability to generate osteoclasts. Taken together, these findings further support our previous observation thatob/obmice exhibit mild osteopetrosis. Osteopetrosis due to a defect in osteoclast function may be responsible for the poor bone quality (Ealey et al. 2006) and defective tooth eruption (Batt 1978,1992) reported inob/obmice.\n\nPair feeding accentuated many of the abnormalities in bone size, mass, microarchitecture, gene expression, and turnover typically observed inob/obmice. Thus, chronic excessive weight gain typically present inob/obmice reduces the magnitude of skeletal effects associated with leptin deficiency. We did not adjust uCT derived cortical bone data for body weight differences because the association between body weight and bone size and density in growing mice varies with bone and bone compartment and this association is altered by leptin (Iwaniec, et al. 2009). However, it is clear that the weight gain due to hyperphagia inob/obmice was associated with increases in cortical bone accrual but that these gains were not commensurate with the magnitude of body weight gain.\n\nThe mechanisms for the partial protective effect of morbid obesity on bone inob/obmice are likely to be multifactorial. We have previously reported a strong positive correlation between body weight and total femur bone mass inob/obmice (Iwaniec et al. 2009). This finding provides strong evidence that the higher total and cortical bone mass inad libitum fed compared to pair fedob/obmice are, at least in part, attributable to higher body weight. Although there have been significant recent advances in our understanding of regulation of bone metabolism by mechanotransduction, the molecular mechanism for this positive effect of weight on bone mass is largely unknown. In addition to direct effects of increased mechanical loading, changes in levels of hormones and/or growth factors may mediate additional effects of increased weight on the skeleton (Robling 2012).\n\nWe did not measure levels of insulin, glucocorticoids, or norepinephrine, factors known to be dysregulated inob/obmice (Dubuc, et al. 1985;Kim and Romsos 1990;Knehans and Romsos 1982;Rafael and Herling 2000) and known to influence bone metabolism. However, housing food restrictedob/obmice at thermoneutral temperature has been reported to reduce abnormalities in blood glucose, insulin, glucocorticoids, and norepinephrine turnover. In contrast,ad libitum fedob/obmice were reported to remain hyperglycemic and hyperinsulinemic (Lindstrom 2007). We confirmed that blood glucose levels in pair fedob/obmice did not differ from WT mice and were much lower than inad libitum fedob/obmice. The contribution of excess insulin secretion and other factors associated with morbid obesity to the protective effects of excess body weight (Hickman and McElduff 1990;Ituarte, et al. 1988;Martineau Doize, et al. 1986;Pun, et al. 1989;Yaturu 2009) on cortical bone microarchitecture inob/obmice requires further investigation.\n\nLeptin is required for gonadotropin releasing hormone secretion (Donato, et al. 2011). As a consequence,ob/obmice are severely hypogonadal (Chehab, et al. 2002). The resulting deficiency in sex steroids would be expected to play a role in the pathological skeletal changes associated with leptin deficiency because sex steroids, especially estrogen, contribute to the sexual dimorphism of the female skeleton and regulate bone turnover balance in adults (Rickard, et al. 2008;Turner, et al. 1989;Turner, et al. 1994). Gonadal dysfunction typically results in elevated bone turnover and cancellous osteopenia. The difference between the skeletal responses to gonadal hormone insufficiency resulting from gonadectomy (high turnover) and from leptin deficiency (low turnover) is perplexing. However, estrogen has a tonic effect on bone resorption and leptin is required for normal osteoclast function. As a consequence, high bone turnover generally associated with estrogen deficiency may be attenuated inob/obmice due to impaired osteoclast function. We speculate that the requirement for leptin in normal osteoclast function may serve as a counter regulatory mechanism to prevent excessive bone loss during fasting.\n\nWe did not measure sex steroid levels but the higher uterine weight inad libitum fedob/obmice compared to pair fedob/obmice implies that morbid obesity results in a small increase in circulating estrogen. Higher estrogen levels in blood or adipose tissue may contribute to the protective skeletal effects of morbid obesity (Gennari, et al. 2011;Turner 1999;Turner et al. 1994). Aromatase, the enzyme responsible for conversion of androgens to estrogens, is expressed by adipocytes (Gennari et al. 2011). Thus, adipose derived estrogen is a plausible mechanism contributing to the skeletal differences between pair fed andad libitum fedob/obmice.\n\nInitially heavier,ob/obmice pair fed to WT mice remained heavier than WT mice for the duration of study. We chose to equalize energy availability rather than body weight in the present study because bone accrual in rapidly growing rodents is strongly associated with energy availability and bone loss accompanies weight loss in adults (Devlin, et al. 2010;Turner and Iwaniec 2011). Low leptin levels induced by caloric restriction are associated with diminished bone mass accrual whereas partial leptin signaling deficiency induced inad lib fed mice by treatment with a leptin antagonist increased body weight and bone mass accrual (Solomon, et al. 2014). However, administration of leptin increases bone formation in adultob/obmice in spite of weight loss (Bartell et al. 2011;Turner et al. 2013). Thus, both adequate energy availability and leptin play important roles in bone accrual in growing mice.\n\nIn contrast to peripheral fat depots, which act as dynamic energy reservoirs to maintain circulating triglyceride and free fatty acid levels during feeding and fasting, marrow fat increases with severe weight loss as well as weight gain (Bredella, et al. 2011;Devlin 2011). It is therefore unlikely that the bone marrow fat depot serves as an important energy reservoir for peripheral tissues. There is, however, evidence that bone marrow adipocytes function as negative regulators of hematopoietic lineage cell differentiation (Dorshkind, et al. 2009;Gimble, et al. 1996;Naveiras, et al. 2009). Bone marrow fat is increased inob/obmice and this increase is reversed by leptin treatment (Bartell et al. 2011;Hamrick, et al. 2005;Hamrick et al. 2004). Leptin stimulates hematopoiesis (Fantuzzi and Faggioni 2000;Trottier, et al. 2012), an action that may be due to inhibition of bone marrow adipogenesis, increased lipolysis, and direct stimulatory actions on hematopoietic cells. Adipocytes and osteoblasts are derived from the same bone marrow mesenchymal precursor and a reciprocal association between osteoblast number and adipocyte number has often been noted, giving rise to the hypothesis that bone marrow adipocytes may either antagonize osteoblast production or, alternatively, generation of adipocytes precludes generation of osteoblasts (Akune, et al. 2004). Other studies suggest that adipocyte and osteoblast number in bone marrow can be independently regulated (Iwaniec and Turner 2013;Menagh et al. 2010).Bartell et al. (2011)reported that intracerebroventricular administration of leptin toob/obmice increases expression of SP7, a transcription factor critical for osteoblast differentiation. Our findings of low expression of SP7 in ob/ob mice support the hypothesis that leptin acts to regulate bone formation by controlling mesenchymal cell decision.\n\nIn the present study, pair feeding to WT mice resulted in a further increase in bone marrow adiposity in leptin deficientob/obmice. Of interest is our finding that pair fedob/obmice had elevated mRNA levels for CD36; CD36 (fatty acid translocase) promotes adipocyte differentiation and adipogenesis (Christiaens, et al. 2012). The observed increase in CD36 may play a role in the increased bone marrow adiposity observed in the pair fedob/obmice. Additional factors regulating bone marrow adiposity that may be influenced by leptin levels and obesity include growth hormone and IGF1. In rats, treatment with parathyroid hormone (whose actions on bone are largely mediated through IGF1) prevented the increase in bone marrow adiposity associated with severe energy restriction (Turner and Iwaniec 2011), whereas growth hormone treatment dramatically reduced excessive bone marrow adiposity in severely hypoleptinemic hypophysectomized rats (Menagh et al. 2010). In both of these studies, treatment had no effect on serum leptin levels.ob/obmice, however, have decreased circulating growth hormone and impaired growth hormone signaling (Luque, et al. 2007), likely contributing to retention of fat within the bone marrow. High circulating insulin levels in morbidly obeseob/obmice may further contribute to the suppression of growth hormone synthesis and release (Luque and Kineman 2006). However, IGF1 is produced and secreted by adipocytes (Kloting, et al. 2008) and higher levels of IGF1 are detected in obese subjects (Frystyk, et al. 1999). Low leptin levels resulting from severe energy restriction are associated with increased growth hormone secretion, decreased circulating levels of IGF1, and end organ resistance to growth hormone (Douyon and Schteingart 2002;Grinspoon, et al. 1995;Inagaki, et al. 2008;Munoz and Argente 2002;Thissen, et al. 1999). Thus, disturbances in growth hormone, IGF1 and insulin signaling as well as leptin deficiency may contribute to the increase in bone marrow adiposity inob/obmice. Chronic hyperphagia and excessive weight gain typically observed inob/obmice may partially compensate for leptin deficiency and reduced bone marrow adiposity by altering growth hormone and insulin levels and sensitivity.\n\nIn summary, leptin deficiency resulted in decreased femur length, BMC, BMD, and cortical bone volume and thickness. In contrast, cancellous bone volume fraction was increased in distal femur and lumbar vertebra. The profound changes in bone mass, density, and microarchitecture were associated with reduced linear bone growth, increased bone marrow adiposity, altered expression of osteogenic genes, decreased osteoblast number, and decreased osteoclast function. Prevention of morbid obesity inob/obmice further exacerbated many of the abnormalities associated with leptin deficiency. Because morbid obesity normally present inob/obmice attenuates the abnormal skeletal phenotype associated with leptin deficiency, the role of leptin in regulating postnatal bone growth, maturation, and turnover may have been underestimated.",
