    "abstract": "Exposure to ionizing radiation can cause rapid mineral loss and increase bone resorbing osteoclasts within metabolically active, cancellous bone tissue leading to structural deficits. To better understand mechanisms involved in rapid, radiation induced bone loss, we determined the influence of total body irradiation on expression of select cytokines known both to stimulate osteoclastogenesis and contribute to inflammatory bone disease. Adult (16 week), male C57BL/6J mice were exposed to either 2Gy gamma rays (137Cs, 0.8Gy/min) or heavy ions (56Fe, 600MeV, 0.50 1.1Gy/min); this dose corresponds to either a single fraction of radiotherapy (typical total dose is >=10Gy) or accumulates over long duration interplanetary missions. Serum, marrow, and mineralized tissue were harvested 4h 7 days later. Gamma irradiation caused a prompt (2.6 fold within 4h) and persistent (peaking at 4.1 fold within 1 day) rise in the expression of the obligate osteoclastogenic cytokine, receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (Rankl), within marrow cells over controls. Similarly,Ranklexpression peaked in marrow cells within 3 days of iron exposure (9.2 fold). Changes inRanklexpression induced by gamma irradiation preceded and overlapped with a rise in expression of other pro osteoclastic cytokines in marrow (eg, monocyte chemotactic protein 1 increased by 11.9 fold, and tumor necrosis factor alpha increased by 1.7 fold over controls). The ratio,Rankl/Opg, in marrow increased by 1.8 fold, a net pro resorption balance. In the marrow, expression of the antioxidant transcription factor,Nfe2l2, strongly correlated with expression levels ofNfatc1,Csf1,Tnf, andRankl. Radiation exposure increased a serum marker of bone resorption (tartrate resistant acid phosphatase) and led to cancellous bone loss (16% decrement after 1 week). We conclude that total body irradiation (gamma or heavy ion) caused temporal elevations in the concentrations of specific genes expressed within marrow and mineralized tissue related to bone resorption, including select cytokines that lead to osteoclastogenesis and elevated resorption; this is likely to account for rapid and progressive deterioration of cancellous microarchitecture following exposure to ionizing radiation.",
    "methods": "Post pubescent (16 weeks+/ 4 days at time of irradiation), male C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratories) were individually housed and provided food (LabDiet 5001) and waterad libitum, as described elsewhere (Yumoto and others2010). Animals were euthanized by CO2inhalation or anesthetized with isoflurane, followed by blood draw through cardiac puncture. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees for NASA Ames Research Center and Brookhaven National Laboratory approved all procedures.\n\nExperiments were conducted to determine the temporal changes in the levels of key genes and circulating proteins related to bone resorption in the latency period before the onset of overt structural loss. To evaluate heavy ion effects, conscious mice were exposed to high LET iron ions (56Fe, 600MeV/ion, 5cGy or 2Gy, at a rate of 5 or 0.50 1.10Gy/min, respectively) at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory, Brookhaven National Laboratory, or were sham irradiated as previously described (n=5 8/group). Mice were euthanized and tissues harvested at baseline (ie, time of irradiation) or 3 or 7 days after exposure. To evaluate gamma radiation effects, conscious mice were irradiated with low LET137Cs gamma rays [2Gy, 0.80Gy/min, as described in detail in Kondo and others (2010)] or were sham irradiated. Euthanasia and tissue harvest took place 4h or 1 day (+/ 2h), 3 days, or 7 days after exposure (n=5 7/group).\n\nBone volume and microarchitecture of the proximal tibial metaphysis were quantified by microcomputed tomography (6.8um pixel size, 3,500ms integration time, 50kV, Skyscan 1174; Bruker microCT) similar to Kondo and others (2009). Briefly, a 1.0 mm thick region located 0.24mm distal to the proximal growth plate of the tibia was selected and semiautonomously contoured to include cancellous tissue. To assess bone loss, the bone volume to total volume fraction (BV/TV, %), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th,um), trabecular number (Tb.N, 1/mm), and trabecular separation (Tb.Sp,um) were calculated and reported following conventional guidelines (Bouxsein and others2010).\n\nFemora and tibiae were dissected, cleaned of soft tissues, flushed of bone marrow with phosphate buffered saline, and stored in RNALater (Qiagen, Inc.) at  80 degreesC. Bone marrow cells were lysed and preserved with guanidine thiocyanate containing RLT buffer (Qiagen, Inc.) with 1% beta mercaptoethanol at  80 degreesC. RNA was extracted from homogenized bone or marrow lysates using Trizol (Ambion), QIAshredder, and an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Inc.). For each tissue, RNA was treated with an RNase free DNase set (Qiagen, Inc.) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. RNA quality and quantity were determined using a spectrophotometer (NanoDrop). The RNA quality was confirmed by electrophoresis using the 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies).\n\nFollowing the manufacturer's recommendations, RNA was reversed transcribed and simultaneously used for qPCR using the GoTaqProbe 1 Step RT qPCR system (Promega). Portions of the following mouse gene sequences were amplified using TaqMan gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems, Inc.): receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (Rankl, assay ID: Mm00441906_m1), Osteoprotegerin (Opg, assay ID: Mm01205928_m1), Tumor necrosis factor alpha (Tnf, assay ID: Mm00443260_g1), monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (Mcp1, assay ID: Mm00441242_m1), interleukin 6 (Il6, assay ID Mm00446190_m1), tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (Acp5, assay ID: Mm00475698_m1), cathepsin K (Ctk, assay ID: Mm00484039_m1), nuclear factor of activated T cells, cytoplasmic 1 (Nfatc1, assay ID: Mm00479445_m1), nuclear factor, erythroid derived 2, like 2 (Nfe2l2, assay ID: Mm00477784_m1), and colony stimulating factor 1 (Csf1, assay ID: Mm00432686_m1). We standardized gene expression levels to mitochondrial ribosomal protein L19 (L19, assay ID: Mm02601633_g1) to correct for differences in cellular input and RNA quality and facilitate comparison between samples. Hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (Hprt1, assay ID: Mm01545399_m1) and transmembrane protein 40 (Tmem40, assay ID: Mm00460636_m1) also were analyzed as alternate housekeeping genes. The reactions were performed in the 7300 RT PCR system (Applied Biosystems) or SmartCycler real time PCR system (Cepheid).\n\nWe analyzed multiple candidate housekeeping genes for normalization, includingL19,Hprt1, andTmem40. Gamma radiation exposure did not modulate levels of the geneL19at the various time points, but transiently and modestly increased gene expression ofHprt1( 0.4 cycles, 1.4 fold) andTmem40( 1 cycle, 2.3 fold). Following iron irradiation,L19(as well asHprt1) showed small increases in cycle number due to treatment ( 0.4 cycles, 1.4 fold forL19). As these differences in housekeeping gene expression were small relative to those of cytokine and resorption marker levels, results reported were normalized relative toL19for both gamma and iron irradiation experiments.\n\nBlood was collected from the heart at the time of euthanasia and serum was separated and stored at  80 degreesC until processed. Enzyme immunoassays were performed for measurement of tartrate resistant acid phosphatase 5b (TRACP 5b), a biomarker for osteoclast mediated bone resorption, using a commercial kit (Immunodiagnostic Systems) according to the manufacturer's protocol.\n\nAll data are reported as mean+/ standard deviation. To determine significant differences compared with sham irradiated controls, a 1 way analysis of variance was used followed by Dunnett'spost hoctest. If data were determined to be heteroscedastic (Bartlett's test), a Welch's ANOVA test followed by apost hoctest using the Bonferroni correction were used to determine significant differences from the sham irradiated controls. Correlation analyses were performed on expression levels of select genes from marrow and bone specimens following gamma irradiation (for the sham and 1, 3, and 7 day endpoints) using the Pearson's product moment coefficient (r). APvalue <=0.05 was accepted as significant for all analyses. All analyses were performed using JMP 8.0.2 (SAS).",
    "results": "To determine the extent of bone loss over the short term, mice were irradiated with56Fe ions (600MeV) or were sham irradiated (0Gy controls), then 7 days later bones were harvested and cancellous microarchitecture in the proximal tibia quantifiedex vivousing 3D microcomputed tomography. Body weights of irradiated and control animals at the time of tissue harvest did not differ (data not shown). Compared with sham controls, irradiation with 2Gy reduced BV/TV by 16%, Tb.N by 15%, and showed a trend of increased Tb.Sp by 11% (P=0.053, ANOVA), but did not affect trabecular thickness (Fig. 1). This is consistent with previous reports (Hamilton and others2006; Alwood and others2010). We included a basal group in our experiments showing BV/TV of 25.1%+/ 3.6%, which was not different from the age matched sham control group. A lower dose of iron (5cGy) failed to elicit changes in bone structural parameters compared with controls and is therefore below the threshold dose for causing bone loss (data not shown). These results validate the model of ionizing radiation induced cancellous bone loss.\n\n2Gy iron irradiation caused acute bone loss in the tibial metaphysis by 7 days through removal of trabecular struts.(A)Bone volume fraction (BV/TV),(B)trabecular number (Tb.N),(C)trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), and(D)trabecular spacing (Tb.Sp). Data are mean+/ SD, with * denotingP<0.05 versus sham.\n\nTo determine if irradiation altered expression of various pro osteoclastogenic genes, mRNA levels in bone marrow cell lysates were measured using quantitative RT PCR 3 days after exposure to high LET iron or sham irradiation. Within 3 days of exposure, iron irradiation increased expression of theRanklgene by 9.2 fold compared with sham irradiated controls (Fig. 2). At this time point, transcripts ofOpgandMcp1were not detected in the marrow (data not shown). Radiation exposure did not alterTnfexpression (Fig. 2). In contrast, a lower dose of iron (5cGy) did not elicit changes in gene expression (data not shown). These data demonstrated that high LET particulate irradiation with 2Gy elicited pro osteoclastogenic cytokine expression in the bone marrow tissue.\n\n2Gy iron irradiation effects on cytokine gene expression in tibial marrow cells on day 3 (expression level normalized toL19). Radiation exposure increased the gene expression levels of(A)Rankl.Gene expression levels of(B)Tnfwere unchanged. Data are mean+/ SD, with ** denotingP<0.01 versus sham.\n\nTo determine if ionizing radiation altered expression of select genes related to osteoclastogenesis (Rankl,Opg) and osteoclast mediated bone resorption (Ctk,Acp5) in cells within the mineralized compartment of skeletal tissue, RNA was purified from bone after removal of the marrow (leaving predominantly osteocytes). Within 3 days, iron irradiation increased expression ofRanklby 1.9 fold,Acp5by 1.5 fold, andCtkby 2.1 fold over sham controls (Fig. 3). Expression levels ofOpgdid not change. The ratio ofRankl/Opgexpression increased 2.8 fold, which provides a relative index that, on balance, cytokine levels favored increased bone resorption.\n\n2Gy iron irradiation effects on gene expression in tibial tissue (sans marrow) by day 3. Comparison of expression levels of(A)Rankl,(B)Opg,(C)Rankl/Opg,(D)Acp5, and(E)Ctkgenes after iron irradiation compared with controls (expression level normalized toL19). Data are mean+/ SD, with ** denotingP<0.01 versus sham.\n\nTo determine whether irradiation altered osteoclastogenic and inflammation related genes, mRNA expression was measured in bone marrow at 4h or 1, 3, or 7 days after low LET gamma irradiation and in sham irradiated controls. Within 4h, 2Gy gamma irradiation elevatedRanklin bone marrow by 2.6 fold over the sham; gene expression ofOpgwas undetectable regardless of treatment (data not shown). Subsequently, the expression of many genes of interest measured in bone marrow (Rankl,Csf1,Nfatc1,Tnf,Mcp1, andIl6) transiently increased within 1 day and subsequently declined toward sham levels (Fig. 4). Expression ofTnfremained elevated through day 3 post irradiation, while highRanklexpression persisted through day 7 post irradiation.\n\n2Gy gamma radiation increased expression of pro osteoclastic and resorption related genes in pooled tibial and femoral marrow (expression level normalized toL19). Time course (+1, +3, and+7 days post irradiation) for the following genes compared with sham control:(A)Rankl,(B)Opg,(C)Rankl/Opg,(D)Csf1,(E)Nfatc1,(F)Tnf,(G)Mcp1,(H)Il6, and(I)Nfe2l2. Data are mean+/ SD, with * denotingP<0.05 and **P<0.01 versus sham and # denotingP=0.061 for the ANOVA.\n\nAt their peak, expression of pro osteoclastogenic genes,RanklandCsf1, and the osteoclast related transcription factor,Nfatc1, increased by 4.1 fold, 4.2 fold, and 2.0 fold, respectively (Fig. 4A, D, E); theRankldecoy receptorOpgshowed a trend toward increased expression by 11.3 fold (P=0.053 by ANOVA,Fig. 4B); pro inflammatory genesTnf,Mcp1, andIl6increased by 1.7 fold, 11.9 fold, and 1.6 fold, respectively (Fig. 4F, G, H), relative to controls. The ratio ofRankl/Opgincreased by 1.8 fold at day 7 after irradiation (Fig. 4C). Additionally, radiation exposure showed a trend toward increased gene expression ofNfe2l2by 1.6 fold on day 1 compared with controls (P=0.061 for the ANOVA,Fig. 4I). Notably, levels ofNfe2l2expression were strongly and positively correlated with the osteoclast related genesNfatc1(P<0.05,r=0.89),Csf1(P<0.05,r=0.63),Tnf(P<0.05,r=0.62), andRankl(P<0.05,r=0.56). These data show the temporal dependence of changes in cytokine gene expression in the marrow following radiation exposure.\n\nFollowing gamma irradiation, mRNA levels in femoral mineralized tissue (sans marrow) were quantified at 3 and 7 days after irradiation or sham using qRT PCR normalized to the housekeeping gene,L19, as shown inFig. 5. Within 3 days, gamma radiation exposure increased the expression ofRankl(2.3 fold),Acp5(2.2 fold), andCtk(2.3 fold). Expression ofTnf,Opg,Nfe2l2, and theRankl/Opgratio was not changed (Fig. 5). These data suggest that bone embedded and/or lining cells contribute to osteoclast stimulation and provide evidence for elevated expression of osteoclastogenic (Rankl) and resorption related (Acp5,Ctk) genes in the skeletal tissue.\n\n2Gy gamma irradiation increased gene expression in femoral and tibial tissue (sans marrow) by day 3. Comparison of expression levels of(A)Rankl,(B)Opg,(C)Rankl/Opg,(D)Acp5,(E)Ctk,(F)Tnf, and(G)Nfe2l2genes after iron irradiation compared with controls (expression level normalized toL19). Data are mean+/ SD, with * denotingP<0.05 and ** denotingP<0.01 versus sham.\n\nTo determine if temporal changes in skeletal gene expression (Figs. 4and5) coincide with changes in a protein biomarker of resorption, the circulating levels of osteoclast specific TRACP 5b were measured at 1, 3, and 7 days after gamma irradiation and in sham controls. Gamma irradiation increased TRACP 5b serum levels by 34% on day 1 and 17% on day 3 compared with sham, with a subsequent gradual decline toward control levels by day 7 (data not shown). Thus, circulating TRACP 5b levels showed a similar time course, although lower in magnitude compared with skeletal gene expression forRankland other pro osteoclastogenic cytokines.",
    "discussion": "To better understand the mechanisms underlying radiation induced stimulation of bone resorption, we investigated molecular signals within the latency period between radiation exposure and the manifestation of cancellous tissue loss. In summary, the results show that exposure to either gamma or heavy ion radiation increased gene expression for the canonical osteoclastogenic factor,Rankl, as well as other pro osteoclast cytokines (Mcp1,Tnf,Il6); this occurred in both marrow and mineralized tissue. These findings do not distinguish between changes in gene expression levels due to a shift in the cell population expressing osteoclastogenic cytokines, a generally higher level of expression for all the cells, or some combination of both. In fact, after exposure to radiation of sufficient dosage, there are pronounced, if transient, changes in marrow cell viability and increases in marrow macrophages, which are likely to contribute to the generation of new osteoclasts. Therefore, we interpret our results to show that exposure to ionizing radiation increased the tissue concentrations of mRNA levels generally so as to favor osteoclastogenesis.\n\nRadiation induced changes in cytokine expression were temporally related to changes in several indices of bone resorption, including gene expression (Ctk,Acp5,Nfatc1) and a serum biomarker (TRACP 5b levels). In addition, marrow expression of the global antioxidant transcription factor,Nfe2l2, showed high correlation with the expression levels of several osteoclast related genes. These data indicate that the activation of oxidative defenses and of osteoclast formation was temporally associated in response to radiation exposure. Our previous work showed radiation induced oxidative damage presents later, at 10 days after exposure (Kondo and others2010). Taken together, our results indicate thatNfe2l2 related antioxidant defense pathways were insufficient to prevent oxidative damage in bone.\n\nChanges in gene expression (as early as 4h or 1 day) preceded bone loss, which manifested in these experiments by day 7 after exposure to 2Gy iron, although in some cases such as gamma irradiation and lower doses of iron, decrements in cancellous bone volume can be observed as early as 3 days after exposure (Kondo and others2009; Yumoto and others2010). Furthermore, a dose threshold was observed, as 5cGy iron exposure failed to elicit changes in cytokine gene expression in the marrow or cancellous bone structure (data not shown); these findings provide additional indirect evidence in support of the hypothesis that early induction of osteoclastogenic cytokine gene expression by biologically effective doses of radiation leads to cancellous bone loss.\n\nTogether, the results demonstrate that radiation induced structural changes were associated with a marrow environment favoring stimulation of osteoclast differentiation and activity byRankland other inflammation related cytokines as follows: Radiation increased gene expression levels for pro osteoclastogenic signaling molecules (Csf1,Rankl,Tnf), as well as a trend toward increasing antiosteoclastogenic molecules (Opg), in the marrow and mineralized tissue of irradiated mice compared with sham controls. Iron irradiation elevated the ratio ofRankl/Opgin both the marrow and skeletal tissue by day 3, whereas after gamma irradiation, the ratio was elevated in the marrow at 4h and then again at day 7.\n\nA rapid stimulation ofRanklexpression by irradiation in the marrow and bone compartment, potentially from hematopoietic lineage cells (Pacifici2010,2012; Fumoto and others2014) or stromal lineage cells (Suda and others1999; Boyle and others2003), is consistent with studies that used radiotherapeutic doses and regimens. In young mice, a single dose of 5 or 10Gy increasedRankl/Opgin whole femora within 3 days (Han and others2014). Using mice deficient in the antioxidant transcription factor,Nfe2l2, radiation exposure at high dose (20Gy) increased RNA expression forRanklin cultured osteoblasts grownex vivo, but this was not observed in cells from wild type mice (Rana and others2012). These findings suggest anNfe2l2 mediated increase in expression of antioxidant enzymes may dampen bone resorption responses to radiation.\n\nFurthermore, when a macrophage cell line (RAW264.7) capable of differentiating into osteoclast like cells after RANKL treatment is exposed to ionizing radiation (2Gy gamma), gene expression levels rise for beta3 integrin, an adhesion receptor that is important for osteoclast differentiation, as well as receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B (Rank), the receptor forRanklon osteoclasts (Yang and others2012). In otherin vitrowork, irradiation with 2 or 4Gy increasesRanklin differentiated, MC3T3 E1 osteoblast like cells (Yang and others2013). Our work is the first to demonstrate the time course of radiation induced changes in expression of various osteoclastogenic cytokines following 2Gy exposure (both low  and high LET) with subsequent bone loss and within the upper range of space relevant doses and types of radiation.\n\nIonizing radiation also increased tissue expression of pro inflammatory, osteoclastogenic ligands,Mcp1,Tnf, andIl6, which are all factors generally thought to stimulate osteoclast activity (Takayanagi2007) in the presence of RANKL (Kostenuik and Shalhoub2001; Yu and others2004; Kim and others2005,2006; Sul and others2012; Liu and others2013). In some reports, TNF may act independently of RANKL to stimulate osteoclastogenesis (Kobayashi and others2000). Our results are consistent with other work showing thatin vivoexposure to ionizing radiation leads to rapid, complex, and interrelated sequence of signals constituting an immune related cytokine response in bone marrow (Schaue and McBride2010; Willey and others2011; Schaue and others2012; Buchwald and Aurora2013). At a very high dose (10Gy), which is sufficient to ablate the bone marrow of hematopoietic cells, radiation causes bone loss related to elevated fractalkine expression by vascular endothelial cells, inflammatory cytokinesTnf, interleukin 1 beta, and interferon gamma, and recruitment of preosteoclasts (CD11b) (Han and others2014). Additionally, the time course of cytokine and resorption related gene expression shown in this study coincides with that of marrow cell death and repopulation (Otsuka and others2008; Kondo and others2010), suggesting a possible relationship between an expanded population of marrow macrophages clearing apoptotic cells and debris after irradiation, the differentiation of macrophages into osteoclasts, and increased resorption activity.\n\nTaken together, these data lead us to propose a 2 stage process for radiation induced osteoclastogenesis: first, radiation induced gene expression of osteoclastogenic cytokines leads to enrichment of the marrow with osteoclast precursors (monocyte macrophage, myeloid lineage cells) and drives differentiation into osteoclasts, and, second, that inflammation related cytokines co stimulate differentiating and mature osteoclasts.\n\nAs a functional measure of active osteoclasts, we provide evidence that 2Gy gamma irradiation elevated circulating levels of osteoclast specific TRACP 5b protein, indicative of increased bone resorption. In this work, the radiation induced elevation in serum TRACP 5b returned to control levels by day 7 following exposure, These results are consistent with those reported by Willey and others (2010,2011) showing that X irradiation (2Gy) of female mice increases circulating TRACP 5b levels 1, 3, and 7 days after irradiation.\n\nRadiation induced decrements in cancellous tissue observed in these experiments were consistent with our previous results. Acute cancellous bone loss temporally manifests on day 3 at a dose as low as 10cGy iron (Yumoto and others2010). Persistent structural decrements (lasting >1 week) manifest at doses above 50cGy iron (Yumoto and others2010) and 1Gy gamma exposure (Hamilton and others2006; Kondo and others2010) before being overtaken, in the case of gamma irradiation, by age related bone loss (Alwood and others2012). Taken together, given the observed time course of skeletal gene expression and serum resorption markers, we conclude that the structural deficits arose from a spike in osteoclastogenic cytokine expression that follows exposure to ionizing radiation (Kondo and others2009; Willey and others2010).\n\nLimitations of this work include the dose rate used to model space radiation. It is an open question whether lower dose rate exposures that constitute true space radiation stimulate osteoclasts and bone loss to the same extent as the exposures used here. In addition, other signaling molecules, including various other cytokines not studied here, are likely also to play a role in regulating bone resorption after challenge with ionizing radiation, while changes in osteoblast lineage cells are likely to be important for maintaining structural integrity at later times post irradiation.\n\nIn conclusion, an improved understanding of the molecular response to radiation exposure may aid the development of biological treatments to mitigate potentially deleterious skeletal consequences during space flight.",
