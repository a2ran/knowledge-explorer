    "abstract": "Cytoplasmic calcium ([Ca2+]cyt) is a well characterized second messenger in eukaryotic cells. An elevation in [Ca2+]cytlevels is one of the earliest responses in plant cells after exposure to a range of environmental stimuli. Advances in understanding the role of [Ca2+]cytin plant development has been facilitated by the use of genetically encoded reporters such as GCaMP. Most of these studies have relied on promoters such asCauliflower Mosaic Virus(35S) andUbiquitin10(UBQ10) to drive expression ofGCaMPin all cell/tissue types. Plant organs such as roots consist of various cell types that likely exhibit unique [Ca2+]cytresponses to exogenous and endogenous signals. However, few studies have addressed this question. Here, we introduce a set ofArabidopsis thalianalines expressingGCaMP3in five root cell types including the columella, endodermis, cortex, epidermis, and trichoblasts. We found similarities and differences in the [Ca2+]cytsignature among these root cell types when exposed to adenosine tri phosphate (ATP), glutamate, aluminum, and salt, which are known to trigger [Ca2+]cytincreases in root cells. These cell type targeted GCaMP3 lines provide a new resource that should enable more in depth studies that address how a particular environmental stimulus is linked to specific root developmental pathways via [Ca2+]cyt.\n\nKeywords:GCaMP3, Arabidopsis, cell type specificity, calcium response, [Ca2+]cyt",
    "methods": "Each promoter was amplified from genomic DNA extracted from wild typeArabidopsis thalianaseedlings using the Plant DNAzol Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) (Table S1). The sequence preceding the start codon for each gene was used in each instance. The resulting fragments were digested with PstI and SalI (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA;http://neb.com) and cloned into a modified pCAMBIA1390 vector [32].GCaMP3was amplified from plasmid DNA and digested with XmaI and BstEII (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA;http://neb.com) and then cloned behind each promoter construct in pCAMBIA1390. To generateUBQ10:GCaMP3, a similar approach was taken.GCaMP3was again amplified from plasmid DNA and then digested with EcoRI and SpeI (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA;http://neb.com) and cloned behind theUbiquitin 10promoter in a previously described pCAMIA1390 vector [33]. Plasmid containingGCaMP3was a gift from Loren Looger (Addgene plasmid # 22692;http://n2t.net/addgene:22692; RRID:Addgene_22692; [34]).Agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation using the floral dip method was used to generate Arabidopsis ecotype Col 0 plants expressing the GCaMP3 constructs [35]. All primers used in this study are listed inTable S2.\n\nSeeds of the variousA. thalianaGCaMP3 lines were planted on coverslips coated with a thin layer of MS supplemented low melting agarose. This set up was prepared by pouring 3 mL of autoclaved 0.5% low melting agarose in 0.5X MS solution (pH 5.7) on 48 x 60 mm No. 1 coverslips (Thermo Scientific, gold seal cover glass reorder no. 3334, Waltham, MA, USA;www.thermoscientific.com) as described in Rincon Zachary et al. (2010) [5]. Coverslips with polymerized agarose were placed in 9 cm diameter round Petri dishes and stored at 4  degreesC prior to planting seeds. In another set of experiments, seeds were planted as soon as the agarose polymerized. Petri dishes and coverslips with the planted seeds were kept in 4  degreesC for 2 days and transferred to a Conviron growth chamber (Controlled Environments Ltd., Winnipeg, MB, Canada) set to 24  degreesC with 14 h/10 h day/night cycle. Petri dishes with the coverslips were kept vertical to enable the roots to grow down and straight along the surface of the agarose. Seedlings were imaged when primary roots were about 3 4 cm long, which was 5 6 days after transfer to the Conviron.\n\nValidation of GCaMP3 expression in the target root cell types was conducted with an inverted Leica TCS SP8 X Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany;http://leica microsystems.com). Seedlings from the Conviron were secured in a horizontal orientation on the stage of the microscope. Seedling roots were illuminated with the 488 nm line of the Argon laser using a 40x (numerical aperture 1.1) water immersion objective and emitted light detected at 510 nm. For some lines, single optical images were acquired at a pixel resolution of 1024 x 1024. For other lines, a Z series was acquired by capturing 81 images at 0.4 um intervals and 3 D images were generated using the LAS visualization software of the Leica confocal microscope.\n\nStock solutions of 1 M ATP (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA; A7699 1G), glutamate (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA; G1149 100G), aluminum chloride (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA; Cas. No. 7784 13 6) and sodium chloride (J.T. Baker, Phillipsburg, NJ, USA; 3624 19) were made with deionized water and stored at 4  degreesC prior to use. Working solutions of 1 mM Al3+, 1 mM ATP, 1 mM Glu, and 150 mM NaCl were made by adding the appropriate volume of the stock solution in 0.5X MS at pH 5.7. Working solutions were made fresh prior to the imaging experiments.\n\nTo measure [Ca2+]cyt dependent GCaMP3 fluorescence, images of growing roots were acquired every 1 s for 10 to 15 min using the Leica SP8 X confocal microscope. Images were captured at a scanning speed of 600 MHz and pixel resolution of 512 x 300. Baseline GCaMP3 fluorescence of the roots was first acquired for 1 min after placing seedlings on the stage of the microscope. Twenty uL of the treatment solution was then added on top of the agarose medium where the root was growing using an adjustable volume pipette while imaging continued. From the collected images, the average fluorescence intensity was acquired by marking a rectangular region of interest corresponding to the specific cell type using the rectangular selection tool of the SPX 8 LAS software. GCaMP3 fluorescence (F) values were normalized using the formulaI=F F0F0where F is the fluorescence intensity at some time point and F0 is the lowest fluorescence intensity point for the data set. Normalized fluorescence values were reported as the mean +/  SE of at least three independent seedlings per GCaMP3 construct [36]. Another round of intensity video imaging was taken for the 0.5x MS control solution to generate the MS control fluorescence curves.",
    "results": "To the best of our knowledge, plant lines expressing genetically encoded [Ca2+]cytsensors that are available to the scientific community are driven by constitutive promoters.A. thalianalines expressing theUBQ10:GCaMP3construct, which we generated and used previously to study [Ca2+]cytoscillations in root hairs [17], is one example. In addition to root hairs, GCaMP3 fluorescence was detected in all cell types of the primary root ofA. thalianaexpressing theUBQ10:GCaMP3construct (Figure 1). Using confocal microscopy, strong fluorescence was observed in cells located at the root surface, such as the peripheral root cap and epidermis (Figure 1A,B,D). Moderate levels of fluorescence could also be detected in the underlying cortex (Figure 1C). However, in cells located deeper within the root, such as the columella and endodermis, fluorescence was obscured by the fluorescence from surface cells (Figure 1A,B).\n\nConfocal imaging of primary roots of 5 day oldA. thalianaseedlings expressingUBQ10:GCaMP3. Representative bright field and corresponding single optical section confocal images of the root tip with a focus on the root cap (A), meristem (B), and elongation zone (C,D).c= columella;end= endodermis;epi= epidermis;cor= cortex. Scale bar: 50 um.\n\nThis prompted us to generate a set of constructs that driveGCaMP3expression in specific root cell types. For this purpose, we used promoters described in the SWELL promoter collection includingATHB8(columella),SCARECROW(SCR, endodermis),Pin Formed 2 (PIN2, epidermis and cortex),PEP(cortex), andProline rich protein 3(PRP3, trichoblasts) [16]. For the five constructs, we found that GCaMP3 signal was most prominent in the expected cell types (Figure 2). For example,ATHB8andSCRpromoters drove strongGCaMP3expression in the columella and endodermis, respectively (Figure 2A,B). ForATHB8:GCaMP3 expressing lines, we also observed weak fluorescence in the peripheral cap cells and the stele. ForSCR:GCaMP3, fluorescence in the endodermis was observed in all root developmental zones from the meristem and elongation zone, continuing into the maturation zone. Roots ofPEP:GCaMP3  andPRP3:GCaMP3 expressing seedlings also showed fluorescence in the expected cell types (i.e., cortex and trichoblast, respectively) (Figure 2C,D). On the other hand, fluorescence was detected in the epidermis and cortex ofPIN2:GCaMP3 expressing lines, consistent with observations of Marques Bueno et al. (2016) [16] (Figure 2E).\n\nExpression ofGCaMP3in specific root cell types. Representative bright field and confocal images of primary roots of 5 day oldA. thalianaseedlings expressingATHB8:GCaMP3(A),SCR:GCaMP3(B), andPEP:GCaMP3(C), respectively.ATHB8:GCaMP3is expressed in the columella with some fluorescence visible in the stele.SCR:GCaMP3is expressed in the endodermis andPEP:GCaMP3is expressed in the cortex.

The image was generated from 50 optical sections taken at 0.50 um intervals. Note that GCaMP3 is predominantly expressed in the epidermis and cortex.c= columella;ste= stele;epi= epidermis;cor= cortex;end= endodermis;t= trichoblast;a= atrichoblasts. Scale bar: 50 um.\n\nStudies on Ca2+signaling in plants over several years have revealed various stimuli that can trigger a rapid elevation in [Ca2+]cytincluding cold, touch, wounding, hormones, reactive oxygen species, cyclic nucleotides, amino acids and nutrient/ionic stress [5,18,19,20,21,22,23]. We used some of these known [Ca2+]cyttriggers to test the responsiveness of our root cell specific GCaMP3 lines.\n\nWe first analyzed the response of the GCaMP3 lines to adenosine tri phosphate (ATP) (Figure 3). In mammalian systems, ATP is a neurotransmitter that is perceived by plasma membrane bound purinergic receptors, and its signaling role is facilitated through increases in [Ca2+]cyt[24]. While plants do not have the canonical purinergic receptors found in mammals, they perceive ATP via lectin receptor like kinases and, similar to mammals, ATP elicits a rapid increase in [Ca2+]cyt[25,26,27]. Comparable to previous reports, application of ATP to the elongation zone of roots expressingUBQ10:GCaMP3elicited a rapid rise in [Ca2+]cyt dependent fluorescence followed by a gradual decline (Figure 3A) [5,25]. To determine if the increase in [Ca2+]cytwas due exclusively to ATP, we applied the solvent control solution, which consisted of 0.5x Murashige Skoog (MS) solution without ATP to roots. We found that applying MS solution triggered a rise in [Ca2+]cytthat was delayed and lower in amplitude compared to the [Ca2+]cytchange caused by ATP (Figure 3A). This observation suggests that under our growing conditions, adding a drop of solvent control solution to the root can induce an increase in [Ca2+]cyt, which could be the result of a touch or hypoosmotic response [19,20,27,28]. Therefore, in testing the cell type GCaMP3 lines, we included solvent control applications in all of the experiments so we could tease apart [Ca2+]cytchanges due to the desired stimulus from those resulting from a touch or hypoosmotic response.\n\nTime course of [Ca2+]cytchanges inA. thalianaroots after 1 mM ATP application. The leftmost panel shows an inverted fluorescence image of the terminal 300 um of anA. thalianaprimary root to illustrate different cells in whichGCaMP3was expressed. Cell types are color coded with green = epidermis; blue = cortex; orange = endodermis; purple = columella; and the pink cells in the inset in panel C = trichoblast. (A F) Quantification of [Ca2+]cyt dependent fluorescence of various lines expressingGCaMP3after ATP and solvent control (0.5x MS) application. Black arrows indicate the time of treatment. Plotted values represent the average normalized fluorescence intensity from 3 6 regions of interest (ROI) per line with standard error bars every fifth time point. Fluorescence values were normalized to the lowest fluorescence value.\n\nUpon applying ATP to roots expressing cell specific GCaMP3 lines, we found similarities and differences in the resulting [Ca2+]cytsignatures. For example, thePIN2:GCaMP3lines, which expressedGCaMP3in the epidermis and cortex (Figure 2), displayed similar [Ca2+]cytsignatures asUBQ10:GCaMP3 expressing lines in response to ATP and the solvent control solution (Figure 3A,B). This is not surprising given thatGCaMP3is strongly expressed in both the epidermis and cortex under the control of theUBQ10andPIN2promoters (Figure 1andFigure 2). For lines expressingGCaMP3in the trichoblasts, application of both ATP and MS control solution triggered a small increase in [Ca2+]cytthat had similar patterns (Figure 3C). For lines expressingGCaMP3in cells located in the root interior such as the cortex, endodermis, and columella (supplementary video 1), ATP induced [Ca2+]cytincreases resembled the patterns ofUBQ10:GCaMP3andPIN2:GCaMP3 expressing lines. However, the [Ca2+]cytincreases triggered by application of MS control solution were not as prominent in these lines when compared to those lines in whichGCaMP3was expressed in the epidermis (Figure 3D F).\n\nThe next chemical we used to test the cell specific GCaMP3 lines was glutamic acid (Figure 4). Like ATP, glutamic acid (glutamate) is a neurotransmitter in mammalian cells that can trigger a [Ca2+]cytincrease [5,14]. Application of glutamate to the elongation zone of roots expressing theUBQ10:GCaMP3construct induced a strong initial [Ca2+]cytincrease with a quick return to equilibrium (Figure 4A). The [Ca2+]cytspikes induced by application of MS controls were also observed in this dataset. Compared to glutamate, the onset of [Ca2+]cytincrease was delayed in roots treated with MS solution. In this case, however, the [Ca2+]cytspikes triggered by glutamate and the MS control solution were similar in amplitude (Figure 4A). Like the ATP treatment, [Ca2+]cytresponse of roots expressingPIN2:GCaMP3to glutamate was similar to roots expressingUBQ10:GCaMP3. Furthermore, [Ca2+]cytchanges in the root elongation zone ofPIN2:GCaMP3 expressing seedlings in response to the MS control solution was delayed, but exhibited a lower amplitude (Figure 4B). Lines expressingPRP3:GCaMP3also had a strong initial [Ca2+]cytpeak after glutamate treatment with a rapid return to equilibrium that resembledUBQ10:GCaMP3andPIN2:GCaMP3lines. LikeUBQ10:GCaMP3andPIN2:GCaMP3lines, application of MS control solution elicited a [Ca2+]cytresponse that was delayed when compared to glutamate exposure (Figure 4C). By contrast,PEP:GCaMP3 expressing lines showed a dampened response to glutamate compared to lines in whichGCaMP3was expressed in the root surface (Figure 4D). Close examination of the time course of [Ca2+]cytsignals in the cortex after glutamate application revealed a triphasic response, with two larger peaks and a delayed smaller peak. Surprisingly, the amplitude of glutamate triggered [Ca2+]cytincreases in the cortex was less than that of MS treated roots (Figure 4D). The lines expressingSCR:GCaMP3andATHB8:GCaMP3showed monophasic responses to glutamate with a gradual return to equilibrium, similar to lines in whichGCaMP3was expressed in root surface cells. Furthermore, unlike lines withGCaMPexpressed in the cortex and root surface cells, the MS control solution response for endodermis  and columella  targeted GCaMP3 had delayed responses and lower amplitudes (Figure 4E,F).\n\nTime course of [Ca2+]cytchanges inA. thalianaroots after 1 mM glutamate (Glu) application.

Plotted values represent the average normalized fluorescence intensity from 3 4 regions of interest (ROI) per line with standard error bars every fifth time point. Fluorescence values were normalized to the lowest fluorescence value.\n\nThe third chemical we tested against the cell type specific GCaMP3 lines was Al3+in the form of aluminum chloride (Figure 5). Al3+is a toxic tri valent cation that competes with both Mg2+and Ca2+to increase the activity of Ca2+ ATPases while disrupting transport of Ca2+through the plasma membrane [5,29]. Similar to previous treatments, the root elongation zone of seedlings expressingUBQ10:GCaMP3showed a monophasic [Ca2+]cytresponse to Al3+(Figure 5A). The onset of the [Ca2+]cytincrease after Al3+treatment was delayed and lower in amplitude compared to ATP, glutamate and solvent control application (Figure 3A,Figure 4A andFigure 5A) [5]. In roots expressingPIN2:GCaMP3, Al3+application elicited a biphasic [Ca2+]cytresponse that consisted of an initial small peak that was quickly followed by a second larger peak, which was broader than the first peak. The onset of the [Ca2+]cytresponse inPIN2:GCaMP3 expressing roots after Al3+treatment occurred earlier than the [Ca2+]cytresponse triggered by solvent controls (Figure 5B). In roots expressingPRP3:GCaMP3, Al3+ induced [Ca2+]cytincrease was larger in amplitude and had a broader peak compared to those observed inUBQ10:GCaMP3  andPIN2:GCaMP3 expressing roots (Figure 5C). The [Ca2+]cytincreases in roots expressingGCaMP3in interior root tissues were less than roots expressingGCaMP3in the surface tissues. Among the three lines in whichGCaMP3was expressed in the interior cell types, the columella specific GCaMP3 line did not show an Al3+ induced [Ca2+]cytpeak (Figure 5F). ThePEP:GCaMP3 expressing lines showed a biphasic [Ca2+]cytresponse with a distinct first peak followed by a second peak with lower amplitude. Although the amplitude of the [Ca2+]cytpeak induced by application of MS solution was similar to the amplitude of the first Al3+ triggered [Ca2+]cytpeak, the onset of the latter was delayed (Figure 5D).SCR:GCaMP3 expressing roots exhibited an Al3+ induced [Ca2+]cytresponse characterized by a broad peak and with a lower amplitude than peaks observed in the root surface  and cortexGCaMP3 expressing lines (Figure 5E).\n\nTime course of [Ca2+]cytchanges inA. thalianaroots after 1 mM aluminum (Al3+) chloride application. The leftmost panel shows an inverted fluorescence image of the terminal 300 um of anA. thalianaprimary root to illustrate different cell types in whichGCaMP3was expressed. Cell types are color coded with green = epidermis; blue = cortex; orange = endodermis; purple = columella; and the pink cells in the inset in panel C = trichoblast. (A F) Quantification of [Ca2+]cyt dependent fluorescence of various lines expressingGCaMP3after Al3+and solvent control (0.5x MS) application. Black arrows indicate the time of treatment. Plotted values represent the average normalized fluorescence intensity from 3 7 regions of interest (ROI) per line with standard error bars every fifth time point. Fluorescence values were normalized to the lowest fluorescence value.\n\nThe final stimulus we used to test the cell type specific GCaMP3 lines was salt in the form of NaCl. Na+is used to regulate the voltage equilibrium in cells, but also has direct effects on the efflux of K+into the cytosol [30]. Ca2+is a regulator for the K+efflux channels [30], so disruption of K+into the cytosol may cause variation in the resting concentration of Ca2+. In roots expressing the fluorescent based [Ca2+]cytsensor Yellow Cameleon 3.60 (YC3.60), NaCl treatment resulted in cell specific [Ca2+]cyttransients in the early elongation zone [31]. Consistent with the results of Feng et al. (2018) [31], roots expressingUBQ10:GCaMP3exhibited late onset [Ca2+]cyttransients (i.e., >10 min) in cells of the elongation zone (Figure 6A;supplementary video 2). These NaCl triggered [Ca2+]cyttransients were observed in the cell targeted GCaMP3 lines except for the endodermis localized GCaMP3 line (Figure 6A D). In certain lines, the onset of [Ca2+]cyttransients occurred much earlier after NaCl application when compared toUBQ10:GCaMP3 expressing lines. The onset of NaCl induced [Ca2+]cyttransients was fastest in roots ofPRP3:GCaMP3 expressing lines followed byPEP:GCaMP3 expressing lines. The [Ca2+]cyttransients in the columella were only observed several minutes after NaCl application (i.e., 12 min after NaCl application;Figure 6C).\n\nNaCl triggered [Ca2+]cyttransients in cell type specific GCaMP3 lines.

Time course (C) and representative heat maps (D) of [Ca2+]cyttransients in roots whereGCaMP3is expressed in interior root cell types. Colors of the line graphs in A and C correspond to the cell types shown in preceding figures. The grey line shows the time course ofUBQ10:GCaMP3 expressing lines. The arrows indicate time of application of sodium chloride. Intensity bar in panel D correspond to high (red) and low (blue) fluorescence with red indicating elevated [Ca2+]cyt.\n\nAs shown in the preceding sections, the 0.5X MS control solution induced [Ca2+]cytchanges inUBQ10:GCaMP3and lines in whichGCaMP3was expressed in cells on the root surface and cortex (Figure 3,Figure 4andFigure 5). Although the MS induced [Ca2+]cytresponses were clearly distinct from ATP, glutamate, and Al3+treatments, we were concerned that the growth conditions in which these first experiments were conducted made roots more sensitive to osmotic changes and/or mechanical perturbation due to the process of adding the solutions. We argued that MS induced [Ca2+]cyttransients could be dampened relative to the chemical applications by: (1) using freshly prepared MS plates for planting seeds and (2) pretreating roots two times with MS solution prior to application of the actual chemical solution. These modifications in our treatment protocols were tested using ATP which typically generated peaks with the highest amplitude.\n\nCompared to the datasets shown inFigure 3,Figure 4andFigure 5, the [Ca2+]cyttransients triggered by the MS solution were significantly dampened when fresh plates were used for the experiments (Figure 7). The dampened MS induced [Ca2+]cyttransients were observed in the two sequential MS applications. Pretreatment with MS solution had the added benefit of allowing roots to adapt prior to ATP application (adapted ATP = ATP:MS). Under these modified growth and pretreatment conditions, the ATP induced [Ca2+]cytincreases were lower in amplitude when compared to the [Ca2+]cytincreases shown inFigure 3. Despite the lower ATP induced [Ca2+]cyttransients, these [Ca2+]cytresponses were better separated from the [Ca2+]cytresponses induced by MS solution, particularly in lines expressingUBQ10:GCaMP3and those in whichGCaMP3was expressed in root surface cell types and the cortex (Figure 7). In addition to the dampened response, [Ca2+]cytresponse to ATP:MS forUBQ10:GCaMP3andPIN2:GCaMP3lines had broader peaks than those shown inFigure 3. ForPRP3:GCaMP3 expressing lines, the [Ca2+]cytresponse was markedly different from the initial ATP treatment (Figure 3C andFigure 7C). Application of ATP after 0.5X MS adaptation caused a strong, monophasic response earlier than eitherUBQ10:GCaMP3orPIN2:GCaMP3lines. Lines expressingPEP:GCaMP3showed a continued elevated [Ca2+]cytresponse that oscillated throughout the 10 min time course compared to eitherUBQ10:GCaMP3lines or the previous ATP treatment (Figure 3D andFigure 7D). For lines expressingSCR:GCaMP3orATHB8:GCaMP3, the response was similar to previous ATP treatments, but without the strong transient peak (Figure 3E,F andFigure 7E,F). After the cell type specific lines were adapted to the 0.5x MS control solution, the response time for ATP:MS was initiated later than the previous ATP treatment (Table 1).\n\nATP triggered [Ca2+]cytresponses in cell type specific GCaMP3 lines planted on fresh MS plates and pre treated twice with MS. MS pretreatment 1 (MS1) time course (black) of [Ca2+]cytin roots show construct treatment with MS control solution. MS pretreatment 2 (MS2) time course (grey) shows construct treatment with a second dose of MS control solution 15 min after first treatment. ATP:MS time course of [Ca2+]cytin roots show cell type specific response 10 min after MS1 and MS2 treatment. Colors of the line graphs in (A F) correspond to the cell types shown in preceding figures with standard error bars every fifth time point. Black arrows indicate the time of application of ATP.\n\nReaction time analysis of [Ca2+]cytresponse where reaction time is the time elapsed from chemical application to maximum GCaMP3 fluorescence (reaction time +/  SE;n= sample size; reaction time is in seconds). Statistical analysis using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with Tukey Post Hoc test (p<= 0.05 for reported significance) was performed for differences in chemical treatments only due to the lack of comparable ROI sections between cell type lines. Due to limited sample size, significance may indicate a general trend rather than actual significance. ATP = adenosine tri phosphate; Glu = glutamate; Al3+= aluminum; MS = control solution; ATP:MS = adapted ATP.\n\na,b,cindicates significant differences between chemical treatments.\n\nTo further tease out the differences amongGCaMP3 expressing lines, we obtained the time elapsed from chemical application to maximum GCaMP3 fluorescence (referred to as reaction time), and analyzed the relationship between chemicals using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with Tukey Post Hoc test (Table 1). Our analysis showed that reaction time was delayed in lines where GCaMP3 was expressed in inner cell types. When comparing the different chemical treatments, ATP, glutamate, and Al3+showed similar responses (exceptATHB8:GCaMP3to Al3+) while adapted ATP:MS showed significantly slower reaction times to both ATP and glutamate (Table 1). However, with such a small sample size, statistical significance may indicate a trend rather than actual significance. NaCl reaction time was not included due to the large variation in responses across each line.\n\nIn comparingUBQ10:GCaMP3lines with the other cell type specific GCaMP3 lines, a ROI was selected and the average of normalized fluorescence intensity was plotted. For the most part, the ROI inUBQ10:GCaMP3lines was from the root epidermis and the average normalized fluorescence intensity from this ROI was compared with that of individual or groups of cells from the cell type specific GCaMP3 lines. This process did not enable direct comparisons of [Ca2+]cytsignatures between the same cell types or root developmental regions. To address this issue, we conducted another set of imaging experiments using ATP treatedUBQ10:GCaMP3andPIN2:GCaMP3lines. For these experiments, a more direct comparison was conducted by drawing ROIs in epidermal cells from similar positions along the root longitudinal axis encompassing the meristem, distal elongation zone, and central elongation zone (Figure 8A). In doing so, we found similarities and differences in [Ca2+]cytsignatures betweenUBQ10:GCaMP3andPIN2:GCaMP3lines. For example, the ATP induced [Ca2+]cytsignatures ofUBQ10:GCaMP3in all root developmental regions were identical to those in the distal and central elongation zone ofPIN2:GCaMP3lines. InPIN2:GCaMP3lines, however, the ATP induced [Ca2+]cytsignature had a much greater amplitude in the meristem (Figure 8A,B).\n\nDirect comparison of ATP induced [Ca2+]cytsignatures in equivalent root developmental regions betweenUBQ10:GCaMP3and cell type specific GCaMP3 lines. Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn in the meristem, distal elongation zone (DEZ), and central elongation zone (CEZ) inUBQ10:GCaMP3(A) andPIN2:GCaMP3(B) roots (inset in A).

Plotted values represent the average normalized fluorescence intensity from 3 4 ROI per line with standard error bars every fifth time point. Fluorescence values were normalized to the lowest fluorescence value.\n\nWe extended our analysis by drawing ROIs in presumptive columella or endodermis ofUBQ10:GCaMP3and comparing the resulting [Ca2+]cytsignatures from these ROIs with those ofATHB8:GCaMP3andSCR:GCaMP3. For the columella, we found thatATHB8:GCaMP3lines displayed an ATP triggered [Ca2+]cytsignature with a sustained peak throughout the 10 min time course. On the other hand, the ATP induced [Ca2+]cytsignature from the presumptive columella region ofUBQ10:GCaMP3lines was transient (Figure 8C). For the endodermis, the peak of ATP induced [Ca2+]cytincrease was higher inUBQ10:GCaMP3when compared toSCR:GCaMP3(Figure 8D).",
    "discussion": "In this paper, we introduced a set ofA. thalianalines expressing the intensiometric [Ca2+]cytreporter GCaMP3 targeted to specific root cell types. Roots of these cell type specific GCaMP3 lines responded to chemical treatments such as ATP, glutamate, Al3+, and NaCl by exhibiting increases in [Ca2+]cyt dependent CGaMP3 fluorescence. Imaging [Ca2+]cytchanges in cell types in response to some of these chemicals using lines in which genetically encoded [Ca2+]cytreporters are expressed ubiquitously have been attempted previously. This was done by drawing a region of interest corresponding to a particular tissue/cell type. For example, it was shown that Al3+ induced biphasic [Ca2+]cytsignatures in the root elongation zone occurred predominantly in the cortex when compared with the epidermis [5]. While this has proven effective for marking developmental regions along the longitudinal axis of the root [5,27], specifying a region of interest to designate root tissue/cell types along the radial axis for fluorescence based measurements of [Ca2+]cytcan be problematic because this does not guarantee complete separation of signals from adjacent cell types. This problem becomes even more challenging for cell types located in the innermost regions of the root such as the columella and endodermis. Moreover, the ability to consistently draw a region of interest to outline the root cortex requires that the root grew in a particular orientation during the imaging experiments [5]. Here, we documented some of the advantages of the cell type specific GCaMP3 lines by comparing [Ca2+]cytsignatures from ROIs marking presumptive columella and endodermis inUBQ10:GCaMP3lines with those ofATHB8:GCaMP3andSCR:GCaMP3. This analysis revealed stark differences in both the amplitude and shape of [Ca2+]cytsignatures. Differences were also uncovered when equivalent root developmental regions were compared, particularly with regard to the amplitude of [Ca2+]cytsignatures in the meristem (Figure 8). The differences are likely due to contaminating signals from other cell types inUBQ10:GCaMP3lines. The use of cell type specific GCaMP3 lines described here could potentially mitigate such problems.\n\nThe [Ca2+]cyttransients in the cell type specific lines induced by these various chemicals had various patterns when compared with lines in whichGCaMP3was expressed ubiquitously. A similarity in patterns occurred within the root surface cells' responses to the different chemical treatments and again within the root inner cell types. Lines in which GCaMP3 was expressed in innermost root cell types such as the columella and endodermis generally had slower response times when compared to lines with GCaMP3 expressed in root surface cells. The delayed response times in lines with GCaMP3 expressed in the columella and endodermis was observed in all chemical treatments (Table 1;Figure 6). One could argue that because of the innermost location of the columella and endodermis, the delay in the response times might be due to the longer time it takes for the chemical to make contact with the target cells. The fact that columella and endodermis exhibit minimal or no [Ca2+]cytincrease after application of 0.5X MS supports this possibility. An alternative hypothesis is that the delayed [Ca2+]cytresponse in the innermost cell types is due to an inward moving [Ca2+]cytwave, which is not easily revealed when GCaMP3 is expressed ubiquitously or on the root surface. From our data, these inward directed [Ca2+]cytwaves appear to be most prominent in ATP  and glutamate treated roots (Figure 3,Figure 4andFigure 7). The GCaMP3 lines described here could present a significant tool for better understanding the radial direction of [Ca2+]cytwaves in roots. A meaningful set of experiments with GCaMP3 lines expressed in innermost cell types will be to locally apply a small volume of the chemical stimulus to the root epidermis.\n\nThe line that was most similar toUBQ10:GCaMP3with regard to chemical induced [Ca2+]cyttransients wasPIN2:GCaMP3. This was not surprising given that thePIN2promoter drivesGCaMP3expression in root epidermal cells, which is the cell type that is readily imaged inUBQ10:GCaMP3lines due to its location on the root surface. With thePEP:GCaMP3lines described here, we were able observe biphasic, triphasic and oscillatory [Ca2+]cytsignatures after Al3+treatment that were reminiscent of some of the observations made by Rincon Zachary et al. (2010) [5] (Figure 5). The cortex  and trichoblast targeted GCaMP3 lines also revealed an earlier onset of NaCl induced [Ca2+]cyttransients when compared toUBQ10:GCaMP3lines (Figure 6). It has been shown that [Ca2+]cyttransients in roots exposed to NaCl is part of the cellular machinery that prevents root cells from rupturing under salinity stress. The plasma membrane localized receptor like kinase, Feronia (FER), is required for root growth recovery after encountering high salinity conditions [31]. Becausefermutants displayed a high incidence of cortical cell rupture when compared to wild type after exposure to NaCl, it is tempting to speculate that earlier onset of [Ca2+]cyttransients in the cortex revealed by thePEP:GCaMP3 expressing lines could be a mechanism to maintain root growth integrity. The cell type GCaMP3 lines described here should be useful in testing this hypothesis.\n\nWhile testing the various cell type specific GCaMP3 lines, we encountered a number of technical challenges brought about by our seedling growth conditions. In several experiments, we found that applying the 0.5X MS control solution alone could trigger a rise in [Ca2+]cyt. The MS only induced [Ca2+]cyttransients were most prominent in theUBQ10:GCaMP3 expressing lines and those in whichGCaMP3was expressed in root surface cell types (e.g.,PIN2:GCaMP3andPRP3:GCaMP3). The [Ca2+]cyttransients observed after MS treatment were reminiscent of touch induced [Ca2+]cytresponses [20], and recent studies on ATP induced [Ca2+]cytsignaling [27], suggesting that we might have been eliciting a touch response as the various solutions were added to the root. In support of this hypothesis, our method for root [Ca2+]cytimaging involved planting seed of the reporter lines on a thin layer of agarose to secure the root while at the same time allowing for the root cells to be accessible to the various chemical treatments ([5]; see Methods). It is possible that some of the [Ca2+]cyttransients observed in response to MS application resulted from roots that were not securely anchored to the agarose medium. Alternatively, the prevalence of MS induced [Ca2+]cytincreases in some of our experiments could be due to osmotic changes when the solution was applied. Because agar for imaging roots was poured in advance, it was possible that liquid in some of the plates may have evaporated during storage. This could have led to some plates having an MS solution that was more concentrated than the treatment solution.\n\nTo test the possibility that MS induced [Ca2+]cytchanges were due to touch or hypoosmotic shock, we repeated the ATP application experiments using roots that emerged from seeds planted on plates with freshly prepared MS supplemented agarose. Furthermore, roots were pretreated with MS solution prior to ATP treatment. Under these modified growth and treatment conditions, we found that MS induced [Ca2+]cytincreases were significantly dampened (Figure 3andFigure 7). Given that [Ca2+]cytchanges are responses that can be elicited by a wide range of stimuli, the results described here highlight the need to carefully consider the growth and treatment conditions, and to include appropriate controls when conducting [Ca2+]cytimaging experiments. Based on these observations, it is imperative that fresh plates be prepared prior to planting the reporter lines and that roots be pretreated with the solvent control solution for a few hours to allow seedlings to adapt.\n\nSome studies have shown [Ca2+]cytsignals propagate along the longitudinal axis of roots [5,26]. Meanwhile, another study has indicated that [Ca2+]cytsignal propagation from the apical into the sub apical can also occur [27]. The cell type specific GCaMP3 lines described here, particularly those lines in whichGCaMP3is expressed in inner root cells such as the cortex , endodermis  and columella specific lines could shed new insights into the direction of [Ca2+]cytsignal propagation within the roots. The MS induced [Ca2+]cytresponses in lines in whichGCaMP3was expressed in the endodermis and columella were not observed. However, these cell types exhibited [Ca2+]cytincreases in response to some of the chemicals, indicating that these [Ca2+]cytchanges can be attributed to the chemical itself. In this regard, it is noteworthy that columella targeted GCaMP3 lines did not exhibit a [Ca2+]cytincrease after Al3+treatment while those lines withGCaMP3expressed in the endodermis lacked a [Ca2+]cytresponse to NaCl. With the establishment of response patterns from the cell type specific GCaMP3 lines when exposed to various chemical treatments, investigation into unique aspects of different root tissues/cells, such as signal propagation direction and response intensity, can be more readily explored.",
