    "abstract": "While numerous health beneficial interactions between host and microbiota have been identified, there is still a lack of targeted approaches for modulating these interactions. Thus, we here identify precision prebiotics that specifically modulate the abundance of a microbiome member species of interest. In the first step, we show that defining precision prebiotics by compounds that are only taken up by the target species but no other species in a community is usually not possible due to overlapping metabolic niches. Subsequently, we use metabolic modeling to identify precision prebiotics for a two memberCaenorhabditis elegansmicrobiome community comprising the immune protective target speciesPseudomonas luridaMYb11 and the persistent colonizerOchrobactrum vermisMYb71. We experimentally confirm four of the predicted precision prebiotics, L serine, L threonine, D mannitol, and gamma aminobutyric acid, to specifically increase the abundance of MYb11. L serine was further assessedin vivo, leading to an increase in MYb11 abundance also in the worm host. Overall, our findings demonstrate that metabolic modeling is an effective tool for the design of precision prebiotics as an important cornerstone for future microbiome targeted therapies.\n\nWhile various mechanisms through which the microbiome influences disease processes in the host have been identified, there are still only few approaches that allow for targeted manipulation of microbiome composition as a first step toward microbiome based therapies. Here, we propose the concept of precision prebiotics that allow to boost the abundance of already resident health beneficial microbial species in a microbiome. We present a constraint based modeling pipeline to predict precision prebiotics for a minimal microbial community in the wormCaenorhabditis eleganscomprising the host beneficialPseudomonas luridaMYb11 and the persistent colonizerOchrobactrum vermisMYb71 with the aim to boost the growth of MYb11. Experimentally testing four of the predicted precision prebiotics, we confirm that they are specifically able to increase the abundance of MYb11in vitroandin vivo. These results demonstrate that constraint based modeling could be an important tool for the development of targeted microbiome based therapies against human diseases.\n\nKEYWORDS:nutritional supplements, flux balance analysis, genome scale metabolic models,Caenorhabditis elegans,Pseudomonas luridaMYb11,Ochrobactrum vermisMYb71, serine",
    "methods": "We explored to what extent individual metabolites, which are only taken up by a single bacterial species and no other, could serve as potential supplements to target individual species. To this end, we considered gut microbiome data from a Kiel based human cohort comprising 1,280 participants for which 16S rRNA gene sequencing data is available, which we had utilized previously (30). As reported previously, the reads were mapped to the 16S sequences of the genomes of bacterial species present in the AGORA bacterial collection (34), the read counts of each sample were normalized to a sum of 1 and removal of species below 0.1% abundance in each sample. We usedgapseqversion 1.1 (32) on the genomes of the identified species assuming the averaged dietary uptake of the human cohort (30) as input to the models to reconstruct genome scale metabolic models. Subsequently, we identified for each bacterial species which metabolites can be taken up. To this end, for each exchange reaction of a metabolite, we set the respective reaction as an objective reaction. By convention, bacterial uptake of metabolites is modeled by exchange reactions where the forward direction corresponds to an excretion of a compound and the backward direction (i.e., negative flux) to its uptake. Therefore, we minimized the flux through each exchange reaction using FBA (40) implemented in theR packagesybil(41) which corresponds to maximizing the uptake of that metabolite. If the minimal flux through the exchange reaction was non zero this metabolite could be taken up. Having repeated this procedure for each exchange reaction, we identified those compounds that can be taken up for each species. Then, we determined for each individual bacterial species in the gut microbiome of each participant whether it could take up a compound that could not be taken up by any other species in the bacterial community of this participant. Finally, we determined for each participant which fraction of the bacterial species contained in the gut microbiome had at least one unique uptake compound. Similarly, we reconstructed 78 bacterial models belonging to theC. elegansmicrobiota based on their published genomes (27) usinggapseqversion 1.2 (32). We then created random subsets of the models with increasing sizes (from 2 to 78, 50 iterations for each size) and determined the portion of strains with unique uptake compounds for each community. For theCeMbiocommunity we used metabolic models reconstructed withgapseq1.2 (32) from Zimmermann et al. (42). In general, the softwaregapseq(32) has an extensive published documentation regarding the reconstruction of genome scale metabolic models, also available online (https://gapseq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\nIn our simulations, we utilized metabolic networks ofP. luridaMYb11 andO. vermisMYb71 that were created from their genome sequences (27) usinggapseq(32) version 1.1. Information from phenotypic microarrays about the organisms' metabolic capacities was integrated into the models using the \"adapt\" module ofgapseq. Specifically, we incorporated data from theBiologEcoPlate (assuming growth if OD590 OD750 >0.1) (24). During growth simulations, exchange fluxes of the models were constrained by assuming a computational nematode growth medium (NGM) (30) and aerobic conditions. These constraints can be found in Table S1. Additionally, the inflow of copper and iron cations was increased, so that they did not restrict the growth of the models. Following published practices (36) and due to the lack of the required kinetic information, we used the concentration values of the NGM medium input for the lower bounds of the models.\n\nWe used three distinct approaches for modeling individual microbes and microbial communities. To model the growth of each bacterium independently, we used FBA (40). We also utilized individual based modeling based onBacArena(36)R package and a community FBA as described previously (39,43,44). The community FBA approach is implemented in theR packageMicrobiomeGS2(www.github.com/Waschina/MicrobiomeGS2) and an overview has been described in detail in the publication by Pryor et al. (30). To measure the effects of supplements on growth of the individual species, we modified the published approach, so that we did not fix species composition but let it be determined as part of the optimization of individual species biomasses. In all types of simulations, we focused on the identification of nutritional supplements that boosted the growth of the target species MYb11.\n\nFor the individual supplementation experiments, the metabolic models of both organisms were constrained with the NGM computational diet, assuming that the molecular values of the dietary compounds (molecular quantities) can be directly incorporated into the models (as fluxes in the lower bounds of the models) without any transformation. This is based on the assumption that the uptake rate of compounds is depicted by its maximum available amount (36). Supplementations for each metabolite were conducted by increasing the possible influx of the supplemented metabolite by 10 mmol/L. For testing the effects of supplements on single growth, the relative increase in growth rate compared to growth without supplements for each model was recorded. To prevent any numerical instabilities, all raw values were rounded to the sixth digit and relative changes bigger than 0.01 were taken into account.\n\nFor simulations using community FBA, the metabolic models of both organisms were merged into one microbial community, compartmentalized, model. Please note that we did not use a fixed community biomass composition as previously (30), since we employed community FBA to predict the resulting growth rates of individual species after maximizing the growth of the community. Thus, the community model was constrained with the NGM diet extended with the individual supplements, as described in the previous paragraph. The growth rates of individual species were predicted by maximizing the sum of the growth rates of individual species with concomitant minimization of the sum of total fluxes as implemented in theR packagesybil(41) (with a coefficient of  10 6for the sum of fluxes in the objective function). Since the supplementations usually also increased the growth of the entire community, the predicted growth rates of each species were normalized with the respective growth rate of the community. Predicted growth rates following supplementation were contrasted against growth rates without supplementation to identify compounds whose effect was larger for the growth of MYb11 in comparison to MYb71. To exclude any numerical artifacts, rounding to the sixth digit and a cutoff of 0.01 in compound selection were also applied in this section.\n\nFor individual based modeling of microbial communities, the metabolic models of both species were simulated in a virtual environment inBacArena, where they could randomly move and reproduce (36) on a 30 x 30 grid. As a growth medium, we used the NGM diet (in mM) which we diluted 1,000 fold, because otherwise bacterial models overgrew the entire simulation environment before nutrients were exhausted. For the simulations, we inoculated the growth environment with 20 individuals of each species and simulated bacterial growth for 12 iterations with 15 replicates for each supplementation using FBA. Replicates are needed since, in contrast to FBA,BacArenaincludes a stochastic component such as a random initial placement of individuals, random movement of individuals and random cellular replication events. A secondary objective to minimize the total flux while maximizing the growth rates of individuals was applied. To simulate the supplementation experiments, 0.01 mM of each compound of interest was added once in the beginning of the simulation. To identify significant changes in the growth profiles of individual species following each supplementation, we extracted the cell biomass information from the simulations using the commandplotGrowthCurveand we calculated the relative change of the total biomass values (time step 13; rounding to the sixth digit) due the supplementations for each model. Then, the relative changes between the bacterial models were compared using Wilcoxon rank sum tests (45). The resultingPvalues were corrected for multiple testing using false discovery rate control implemented inR. We selected those compounds whose effect on MYb11 was larger than on MYb71 based on the median of the respective relative changes for each model.\n\nBased on these simulation techniques, we identified those compounds that specifically boosted MYb11 across the simulations. Subsequently, we subsetted this list to compounds for which we had positive confirmation of their uptake by MYb11 fromBiologexperiments (24,27). For the enrichment analysis of growth supporting compounds of MYb11, we used the human metabolome database (HMDB) annotation for the available metabolite classes (46). Briefly, we tested whether the sets of candidate compounds were enriched in the metabolite classes defined in HMDB using Fisher's exact test. As the underlying set of metabolites, we used the metabolites contained in the metabolic model of MYb11 in the different metabolite classes.\n\nSimulations and analyses were performed in theRenvironment (versions 4.0.0, 4.0.3, and 4.2.1). Model reconstructions were performed with thegapseqsoftware (versions 1.1 and 1.2) (32) Optimizations were generally conducted using the softwaresybil(versions 2.1.5 and 2.2.0) (41). Specifically, multi model supplementation was conducted using the softwareMicrobiomeGS2(version 0.1.5,www.github.com/Waschina/MicrobiomeGS2) and the in silico co culturing was simulated onBacArena(version 1.8.2, commit fdb02bf7) (36). Both incorporatesybilin their pipelines. The linear programming solver wasCPLEX(versions 12.10.0 and 22.1.0), based on theRpackagecplexAPI(version 1.4.0). For data management, the softwaredplyr(versions 1.0.2, 1.0.4, and 1.0.9),tidyr(version 1.1.3),tidyverse(version 1.3.2) (47), anddata.table(version 1.14.2) were used. For parallel computing, the softwareforeach(version 1.5.0 and 1.5.1) anddoMC(version 12.10.0) were used. For plotting, the softwareggplot2(versions 3.3.3 and 3.3.6) (48),egg(version 0.4.5), andggVennDiagram(version 1.2.2.) were utilized.\n\nTo determine bacterial growth in mono  and co culture either in the presence or absence of supplementation, similarly to the computational section, the two naturally associatedC. elegansmicrobiota isolatesP. luridaMYb11 andO. vermisMYb71 were used. Fluorescently labeled MYb11::dTomato (21) and MYb71::GFP were used to distinguish the two bacterial species in a mixed community. For comparison, reverse labels were also tested, using MYb71::dTomato and MYb11::sfGFP, to ensure no impact of the fluorescent label (Fig. S2). Integrated fluorescent strains of MYb71 and the MYb11::sfGFP strain were constructed by transposon insertion at theattTn7site following published work (49). Briefly, two populations ofEscherichia coliSM10 strains were prepared: (i) a donor strain containing either pTn7xKS sfGFP (pTW415) or pTn7xKS dTomato (pTW416) plasmids, and (ii) a helper strain containing the pTNS2 (pTW10) plasmid. Liquid cultures (5 mL LB) of donor, helper (both 37 degreesC) and target strains (26 degreesC) were grown with agitation overnight, subcultured, and collected at an OD 0.4 0.6. Tripartite mating mixtures consisted of equal parts (1:1:1), incubated overnight at 26 degreesC, followed by selection on LB agar plates containing gentamicin (10 ug/mL) and IPTG (1 mM). Fluorescent colonies of MYb71 were verified by PCR and sequencing using two pairs of MYb71 specific primers to the glmS gene region: (i) oDB097 (5 CGCTCTGATCGATGAGACC 3) and oDB098 (5 TTGCGCGGCTGRTCGAC 3), and (ii) oDB097 and a transposon WP11 primer (5 CACGCCCCTCTTTAATACGA 3) (49). MYb11::sfGFP was similarly confirmed by PCR and sequencing, following our previous protocol (21).\n\nBacteria were thawed from frozen stocks for each experiment, streaked to tryptic soy agar (TSA) plates and grown for 16 42 h at 25 degreesC. Bacterial cultures of MYb11 and MYb71 were grown in liquid NGM overnight at 28 degreesC in a shaking incubator. Cultures were adjusted to OD600= 0.5 with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). We combined equal volumes of the adjusted cultures and used these as starting co cultures for all experiments with the two strains, thus ensuring identical starting conditions across experimental treatments, as required for inference of an influence of the experimental manipulation on relative bacterial abundances.\n\nL serine (1714.1), D mannitol (8883.1), and L threonine (T206.1) were purchased from Carl Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany), and GABA (A2129) from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) and dissolved to 1 M or 0.5 M stocks in water, depending on the maximum soluble concentration. Liquid NGM was supplemented with a final concentration of 10 mM of the respective supplement. For supplementation assaysin vitro, 5 uL of either mono  or co culture of the bacteria was added to 95 uL of liquid NGM in a 96 well plate, in the presence or absence of supplement. Treatments were randomized with respect to plate layout. Plates were incubated at 28 degreesC for 24 h in an Epoch2 BioTek plate reader with double orbital shaking at 807 CPM. We assessed changes in bacterial abundances by quantifying the number of colony forming units (CFUs) of a sample of the cultures plated out on agar, because this allows us to distinguish between the two strains, which is not possible using standard OD measurements. For this approach, 7 uL of different dilutions of each treatment bacterial suspension of respective mono  or co cultures was plated onto TSA plates. The plates were stored at 25 degreesC and CFUs scored after 24 48 h. Statistical calculations and plots were performed withRsoftware (version 4.1.3). For all CFU assaysin vitro, statistical comparisons were performed with Wilcoxon signed rank tests (45).\n\nTheC. elegansstrain N2 was used for allin vivoexperiments and was originally obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (CGC). Worms were maintained on NGM plates inoculated withE. coliOP50 at 20 degreesC following standard procedures (50). Assay plates were prepared by adding L serine at a concentration of 0, 10, or 100 mM to NGM. Please note that serine can affectC. elegansforaging behavior (51). However and importantly for our proof of concept study, none of the numerousC. elegansforaging studies [including our own long term experience (52 54)] indicated that this nematode is capable of a differential uptake of distinct bacterial strains from a mixed bacterial lawn. Therefore, any possible change in serine induced nematode behavior is unlikely to cause any changes in the relative abundance of bacterial strains in theC. elegansgut as long as identical starting cultures are used across experimental treatments, which we ensured with our experimental protocol. Overnight cultures of MYb11 and MYb71 were adjusted to OD600= 2.0 in PBS. Thirty to forty synchronized first instar larvae (L1) were grown on supplemented NGM plates inoculated with 125 uL of respective mono  or co culture of MYb11 and MYb71. After 72 h, bacterial lawns were sampled by pressing the circular end of a 200 uL pipette tip into the lawn, avoiding the edges and any worms. The resulting disc was homogenized in PBS with zirconia beads in a Bead Ruptor 96 (Omni International) for 3 min at 30 Hz.\n\nTo assess the number of CFU, worms were washed off plates using M9 buffer + 0.025% Triton X 100, washed five times and paralyzed with 5 mM tetramisole to stop pumping of the worms as described in (24). Worms were surface sterilized following (24), then washed two times in PBS to remove residual bleach. Worms were transferred to a new tube to determine the exact worm number (~20) and PBS was added to a final volume of 400 uL. Worms were allowed to settle and 100 uL supernatant was collected (supernatant control). Worms were homogenized in the remaining PBS using 1 mm zirconia beads in a Bead Ruptor 96 for 3 min at 30 Hz. Homogenized worms, lawns, and supernatants were serially diluted in PBS and plated on TSA plates. After up to 48 h at 25 degreesC, the colonies were scored at the appropriate dilutions and the CFUs per worm were calculated. Each colonization experiment was conducted in three independent runs and equal biological replicates. Data were pooled across runs, and a mixed model controlling for runs was used to assess the effect of L serine supplementation on bacterial colonization inC. elegans. For all L serinein vitroandin vivoexperiments, statistical comparisons were performed with generalized linear models, if not otherwise mentioned. We calculated the expected proportion of MYb11 in worms as the product of MYb11 proportions available on the lawns and the observed shift in bacterial proportions due to host filtering:\n\nPlots and statistical analysis were produced withR(version 4.1.3) and edited with Inkscape (version 1.1.2).",
    "results": "The simplest approach to specifically boost the abundance of a particular bacterial species in a microbial community is to supply the community with a compound that is only taken up by the target species but no other species. Hence, these compounds correspond to unique metabolic niches for the respective bacterial species. We initially tested computationally whether such unique uptake compounds typically exist in bacterial communities, using bacterial communities from a human cohort as well asC. elegans(30). We evaluated for each bacterial species of a particular community whether it was able to take up a metabolite that no other species of the community could take up and determined the fraction of bacterial species in the community that had such unique uptake compounds (see Materials and Methods). For the human cohort, the bacterial communities comprised on average 26 34 bacterial species (25 75% quantiles). Within this community size, on average, 5 20% of bacterial species were inferred to possess unique uptake compounds that could potentially be used to target those species. For smaller communities, up to 50% of bacterial species and for larger communities, only 5 10% had unique uptake compounds (Fig. 1A). ForC. elegans, we do not have matching data like for the human cohort with species abundance information for a large number of samples and genome sequences of the corresponding bacterial species for metabolic modeling. However, we can use strains that have been isolated fromC. elegansand its environment as well as artificial minimalC. eleganscommunities to approximate the frequency of unique uptake compounds in theC. elegansmicrobiota. Thus, within a sample of 78 bacterial species isolated fromC. elegansand its environment, we usually only identified 3 5% of species with unique uptake compounds in communities comprising 30 or more bacterial species, which is the typical size of bacterial communities observed inC. elegans derived microbiome samples (55) (Fig. 1B). Similarly, in the artificialCeMbio C. elegansmodel microbiome community unique uptake compounds could usually only be detected for subsets of bacterial species up to a size of six member species (Fig. 1C).\n\nFrequency of species with unique uptake compounds in microbiomes. Fraction of species with unique uptake compounds in (A) human gut bacterial communities and in (B and C)C. elegansbacterial communities that are subsets of previously reportedC. elegansmicrobiome member species.\n\nThus, in a typical microbiome like those analyzed above, we would expect to be able to identify unique uptake compounds only for a minority of bacterial species and compounds to target specific bacterial species are typically expected to be consumed by several species. Thus, for our identification of precision prebiotics for MYb11, we first excluded 20 compounds from our search that could specifically be taken up only by MYb11 in the search for a MYb targeted prebiotic (20 compounds, see Table S2). Of note, MYb11 and MYb71 share the vast majority of all uptake compounds (85%), while only 10% and 5% of all uptake compounds are unique to MYb11 and MYb71, respectively (Fig. 2A).\n\nMetabolic modeling guided identification of precision prebiotics.

(D) Comparison of predicted precision prebiotics for MYb11 in community with MYb71 with different computational approaches (first three columns) and growth data onBiologEcoPlates andBiologGN2 plates (24,27) (last two columns). Full squares represent cases in which a metabolite was predicted as precision prebiotic for MYb11, empty squares if modeling predicted no increased growth of MYb11 over MYb71. For theBiologdata, filled triangles represent cases of catabolization of the respective compound and empty ones if no catabolization was observed. Missing circles indicate compounds not tested by Biolog plates.\n\nIn order to derive precision prebiotics forP. luridaMYb11, we used its metabolic network as input for flux balance analysis and two distinct community modeling approaches apart from the basic approach of FBA. The first one is based onBacArenathat incorporates an individual based modeling approach and the other one is so called community FBA implemented inMicrobiomeGS2. These two modeling approaches differ in their underlying assumptions. InBacArenathe two bacteria are modeled by their individual metabolic networks and fluxes are predicted by maximizing the biomass fluxes of individual bacteria. In community FBA, in turn, the metabolic networks of the individual bacterial species are merged into a community model for which the sum of biomass fluxes of both bacterial species is maximized. Thus, when usingBacArena, metabolic interactions between species typically arise from one species secreting an end product that another species can metabolize. In community FBA, in turn, the optimization of total growth assumes that bacterial species coordinate their metabolic fluxes so that overall growth is maximized. Thus, since we do not know to which extent MYb11 and MYb71 mutually interact with each other, we cover both ends of the spectrum of potential interactions between species from completely individually optimized behavior inBacArenato an absolute coordination of fluxes to maximize overall community growth.\n\nUsing FBA, we identified 29 compounds that could increase the growth of MYb11 in single growth. Employing the community modeling approaches, we identified 81 compounds that increased the growth of MYb11 over MYb71 in community FBA and 17 compounds usingBacArena(Fig. 2D). In order to determine whether specific compound classes were enriched among the MYb11 supporting compounds, we performed an enrichment based on HMDB annotation (46) across the three different simulation types. We found that growth supporting compounds for MYb11 were enriched for fatty acids (Fisher's exact testPvalue = 3.16 x 10 5).\n\nInterestingly, the growth dynamics of the models when they were part of a community model (Fig. 2B) differ from the growth dynamics of the models when they were treated as individual organisms (Fig. 2C). For instance, MYb71's biomass flux was much higher in the community model, i.e., when coupled to the model MYb11. This is a typical observation when using community FBA when the biomass of the entire community is maximized. Especially for small communities, this often leads to one community member that most efficiently turns the growth medium into biomass to grow strongest with only little growth for other community members. On the other hand, in theBacArenasimulations, we observed that most of those compounds boosted the growth of both species in single growth, however, the effect was larger for MYb11 than MYb71 (Fig. 2C). WhileBacArenaalso uses FBA to simulate bacterial growth, only a subset of FBA predicted compounds that increase the growth of MYb11 over MYb71 was actually also identified by theBacArenaapproach (17 out of 29). The likely reason is that the FBA approach does not take into account potential interactions between species and thatBacArenaincorporates a stochastic component, for instance, for determining positioning as well as movement of bacteria and cellular replication events, such that small differences in growth rate between bacterial species might be filtered out by these stochastic events. Of the identified compounds, 17 compounds were shared across the three simulations. For eight of these, also information on uptake by MYb11 was available fromBiologplates which confirmed that MYb11 was able to consume them (24,27) (Fig. 2D). Thus, combining modeling approaches and cross referencing data fromBiologplates allowed us to considerably reduce our list of candidates to test experimentally to those giving the most consistent results. Based on the available literature information on the role of these compounds in longevity of the host (56,57) or physiology (58), as nutritional compounds (24,59), or compounds that are involved in host microbial interactions (58,60), we selected four candidates for further experimental testing as precision prebiotics to specifically increase the abundance of MYb11.\n\nAs a proof of concept, we experimentally tested the ability of four of the predicted precision prebiotics compounds, L serine, L threonine, GABA, and D mannitol, to specifically increase the growth of MYb11 in co culture with MYb71. L serine is a dietary amino acid that has been involved in nutrition drug host microbial interactions (60) and can support the lifespan of the host (57), L threonine, an essential amino acid (59), through its catabolite methylglyoxal (in low amounts) can also have a positive effect on host's lifespan (56). GABA, apart from being a bacterial product, is protective for the host's neurons (58). Finally, D mannitol is a commonly used sugar alcohol (24), therefore its usage as a nutritional compound would make its usage as a supplement a safe option for the host.\n\nWe supplemented MYb11 and MYb71 in mono  as well as co culture and measured bacterial growthin vitroin liquid NGM after 5 h (Fig. S1) and 24 h. Independently of the added supplement or the mono  or co culturing, MYb11 and MYb71 showed increased growth in mono  and co cultures when supplemented with 10 mM L serine, L threonine, GABA, as well as D mannitol after 24 h (Fig. 3A; Tables S6 to S9). Additionally, to quantify bacterial growth, we used fluorescently labeled strains. CFU of mono  and co culture were plated and counted after 24 h growth in liquid culture in the presence (10 mM) or absence (0 mM) of the four compounds L serine (Fig. 3B; Table S10), L threonine (Fig. 3C; Table S12), GABA (Fig. 3D; Table S13), and D mannitol (Fig. 3E; Table S14). MYb11 and MYb71 showed increased colony numbers in mono culture when supplemented with L serine and L threonine compared to no supplementation (Fig. 3B and C, Wilcoxon signed rank test, P= 0.001,P= 0.006,P= 0.007,P= 0.032, respectively). GABA supplementation led to an increase in the growth of MYb11 in mono culture, but not MYb71 (Fig. 3D, Wilcoxon signed rank test,P< 0.001,P= 0.922, respectively), while D mannitol had no effect on the growth of MYb11 nor MYb71 in mono culture (Fig. 3E, Wilcoxon signed rank test, P= 0.259,P= 0.661, respectively). Thus, while serine as well as threonine boosted growth of MYb11 in co culture versus unsupplemented single growth, and mannitol as well as GABA did not change growth in co culture versus unsupplemented single growth, all four compounds specifically promoted MYb11 growth in co culture over MYb71in vitroand thus confirmed the computational predictions (Fig. 3B through E, Wilcoxon signed rank test, P= 6.87E 06,P< 0.001,P= 7.15E 06,P= 7.07E 06, respectively) (see also: Table S11)\n\nIn vitrogrowth ofPseudomonas luridaMYb11 andOchrobactrum vermisMYb71 in mono  and co culture with four different supplements for 24 h.

The CFU count data of every replicate was normalized by subtracting the median of the CFU count data from the corresponding non supplemented control treatments (control and experimental data provided in the Tables S10, S12 to S14). Black asterisks indicate statistical comparisons between supplemented and non supplemented median, gray asterisks indicate statistical comparisons between supplemented medians of MYb11 and MYb71.n= 5 14.\n\nThe statistical analyses suggested that L serine is the most promising precision prebiotic for further analysis among the compounds validatedin vitro. We repeated thein vitrosupplementation experiment across a concentration gradient to determine the optimal dose for enrichment of MYb11. Overall, the MYb11 growth as well as MYb71 growth in monoculture at 10 and 100 mM over time were increased following the increase in L serine concentrations (Fig. 4A; Table S15). When quantifying the growth with supplementation at the same concentration gradient (Fig. 4B; Table S16), then starting with 1 mM did not significantly impact the abundance of MYb11 proportions (GLM,P= 0.778), nor MYb71 (GLM,P= 0.69). However, supplementation with 10 mM led to an enrichment of MYb11 (GLM,P< 0.001), thereby indicating a significant difference in proportions in co culture between MYb11 and MYb71 (GLM, P= 5.77E 07). Essentially identical results were obtained at 100 mM, including an MYb11 enrichment (GLM,P= 0.004), and a significant difference between MYb11 and MYb71 proportions (GLM,P= 7.93E 05). (See also: Table S17)\n\nConcentration dependent effect of L serine supplementation on bacterial growthin vitro.(A) Bacterial growth was measured based on optical density (OD600) of each species in mono culture in liquid nematode growth medium (NGM) with the respective L serine supplementation of 0, 1, 10, or 100 mM. Points represent individual replicates, while lines indicate the mean,n= 12. (B) Relative abundance of MYb11 (pink) and MYb71 (green) in co cultures grown for 24 h with the respective supplement concentration in liquid NGM, based on colony counts of fluorescently labeled bacteria. Shown are boxplots with the median as a thick horizontal line, the interquartile range as box, the outer quartiles as whiskers, and each replicate depicted by a dot. Bacterial abundances of every replicate were normalized by subtracting the median of the corresponding non supplemented control (0 mM) for each bacterial strain; the respective median values are indicated by the dashed lines. Statistical differences were determined by GLM and are indicated by asterisks (***P< 0.001). Black asterisks indicate statistical comparisons between supplemented and non supplemented median, gray asterisks indicate statistical comparisons between supplemented medians of MYb11 and MYb71.n= 9 12.\n\nFinally, we tested whether L serine supplementation to solid growth medium would alter bacterial proportions in the hostC. elegans. Synchronized populations of L1 larvae were pipetted onto bacterial lawns of MYb11 and MYb71 on solid NGM plates supplemented with either 0, 10, or 100 mM L serine. After 72 h, adult worms were collected to quantify bacterial proportions. Supplementation at 10 mM L serine did not change the proportion of MYb11 in co culture in worms compared to non supplemented media (GLM,P= 0.459,Fig. 5Aleft panel). However, L serine supplementation at 100 mM increased the proportion of MYb11 in the bacterial community in worms compared to non supplemented media (GLM,P< 0.001,Fig. 5A, right panel). We next asked whether the effect of supplementation on bacterial proportions in the host simply reflected changes in the proportion of bacteria that were available to them on the lawn (i.e., their diet). The relative abundance of MYb11 on lawns did not change by 10 mM supplementation (GLM,P= 0.61,Fig. 5A, left panel) compared to non supplementation. However, the relative abundance of MYb11 was approximately 60% in non supplemented media and increased to approximately 75% with 100 mM L serine supplementation (GLM,P< 0.002,Fig. 5B, right panel). The observed proportions of MYb11 in worms at 100 mM serine were significantly higher than expected based on proportions in the lawn and thus colonization probability compared to MYb71 (chi squared test,2= 10.244,df= 1,P= 0.0013; see Materials and Methods). This suggests that the provision of serine enriches MYb11 in the host independently from the enrichment observed on the lawn and that serine allows MYb11 to overcome its growth disadvantages in competition with MYb71 in the host (see also: Table S18 and S19).\n\nL serine supplementation alters bacterial abundance inC. elegans.(A) Adult worms were collected from solid NGM plates, which had been inoculated with co culture and supplemented with 10 mM L serine (left panel) or 100 mM (right panel) L serine. Worms were washed and surface sterilized to remove residual bacteria, then homogenized in a buffer. Bacterial proportions were quantified based on colony counts. (B) Bacterial lawns were sampled by cutting an agar disc of standardized size from NGM plates supplemented with 10 mM (left panel) or 100 mM L serine (right panel). Discs were homogenized in buffer, and CFUs were quantified. (A and B) Shown are boxplots with the median as a thick horizontal line, the interquartile range as box, the outer quartiles as whiskers, and each biological replicate depicted by a symbol. For each replicate and each bacterium, bacterial abundance from experimental treatments was normalized by subtracting the median of the corresponding non supplemented controls (0 mM), as indicated by the dashed lines. Statistical differences were determined by GLM and are indicated by asterisks (***P< 0.001, **P< 0.01) and show comparisons between supplemented and non supplemented median.",
    "discussion": "Although many factors are known to influence microbiome composition [e.g., dietary patterns, lifestyle, or medication (61)], the mechanisms causing these changes are often not fully understood and often a large number of bacterial species are affected. We propose that the most effective way to modulate the composition of the microbiome is by modulating or enriching the abundance of an already existing bacterial species with health beneficial effects using precision prebiotics. A direct approach to identify such precision prebiotics would be to provide compounds that are uniquely taken up by the bacterial target species. However, through an analysis ofC. elegansand human microbiome data, we were able to show that such unique uptake compounds typically only exist for few species in a microbial community and especially for larger communities there are no such compounds at all. Thus, in a typical microbiome, precision prebiotics have to be identified from compounds that are potentially taken up by several species. To identify such compounds, we used genome scale metabolic networks of two bacterial members from theC. elegansmicrobiome,O. vermisMYb71, and the host protectiveP. luridaMYb11, in conjunction with constraint based modeling to identify compounds that specifically increased the growth of MYb11. Using HMDB annotation (46), we found that fatty acids were enriched as predicted growth supporting compounds for MYb11 which is in agreement with previous observations of the preference of bacteria of the genusPseudomonasfor these compounds (62). Considering compounds that were identified across all three simulation approaches and cross referencing withBiologdata revealed that 4 hydroxybenzoate, D mannitol, gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycerol 3 phosphate, L serine, trehalose, L threonine, and putrescine are potential precision prebiotics for MYb11. We experimentally tested four of these predicted compounds, L serine, L threonine, D mannitol, and GABAin vitroand confirmed their positive effect specifically on the growth of MYb11. Moving into theC. eleganshost system, we were able to show that L serine is also able to selectively boost the abundance of MYb11in vivo, when the host was colonized with both bacterial species. Interestingly, while 10 mM of L serine was sufficient for an enrichment of MYb11 in batch culture, 100 mM was necessary in the growth experiments with the host. This suggests differences in either bacterial uptake kinetics for L serine or bacterial growth in general between batch growth and growth on agar plates. Moreover, while MYb11 was strongly enriched in worms to similar levels like MYb71 even though it had a very low abundance in the lawn, this enrichment was even stronger when supplying L serine. Thus, our proof of principle work demonstrates that constraint based microbial community modeling approaches are an effective tool for the future development of targeted microbiome therapies using precision prebiotics.\n\nThe effect of serine and threonine on the host and/or on its microbiome has been also documented in the literature. For instance, threonine is an essential amino acid for the host (59). Longevity effects on the host have been shown also after supplementation with threonine (63) and serine (57), while dietary serine reduced host fitness through acting on bacterial metabolism, when it was supplemented along with the chemotherapeutic 5 fluoro 2deoxyuridine (60). Moreover, serine promotes the growth ofE. coliLF82 in the mouse gut (64), which shows the potential of this compound to alter the abundance of multiple species. In accordance, we also observed the effects of serine on MYb71 growth, which was, however, stronger for MYb11 if they were grown in community.\n\nOne important challenge to specifically target the microbiome with nutritional supplements is to prevent host uptake or metabolization of the supplements (65). Different approaches to achieve restricted bioavailability, such as the supplementation of non digestible carbohydrates (66) or coating of supplements with compounds that dissolve during passage through the digestive tract have been developed (67 69). Moreover, as indicated by our analysis of concentration dependent effects of supplementation in the case of serine, it might be necessary to control the specific concentrations of a compound that are being released and their stability over time in the gut. From the bacterial side,Biologassays have shown that MYb11 has the capacity to catabolize serine (Fig. 2D). However, the specific concentrations used on theBiologplates and the mechanisms of transport that are possibly dependent on those concentrations are not known. From the host side, to maintain relatively constant concentrations in the host environment or to deviate from its normal concentrations, advanced formulations such as nanotechnology (70), delayed release, and other drug delivery technologies (71,72) could be employed.\n\nAlthough our combined computational experimental approach can serve as a blueprint for future studies aimed at the identification of precision prebiotics, several factors should still be taken into consideration. As we showed, it is nearly impossible to identify a compound that is uniquely taken up by only one species within a community. This point becomes apparent, if we consider the numerous different species that reside in various hosts. For instance, the synthetic bacterial community ofC. elegans,CeMbio(24) has 12 members, while the human related bacterial community AGORA has more than 800 species (34). Thus, an important next step is to scale up our approach to more complex communities. Also along these lines, we did use automatically reconstructed bacterial metabolic networks from our gapseq approach rather than manually curated networks which resembles the typical situation in the human gut microbiota where a detailed manual reconstruction of the hundreds to thousands of already detected and sequenced bacterial species is practically impossible. Furthermore, since the physiology of worms cannot be directly compared to the physiology of humans, the efficacy and effectiveness of the approach [see more on the topic (73)] need to be studied in more detail. At this point, the complexity of the regulatory affairs in various jurisdictions (e.g., the definition of nutritional supplementation vs medication, safety concerns) should also not be underestimated (74). Additionally, while the modeling approach we used has quite a number of underlying assumptions, it allowed us to considerably narrow down the list of potential candidate metabolites for experimental testing. Finally, we did not consider potential side effects of the supplemented metabolites on the worm host and did not optimize the mode of delivery, for instance, to release the supplement specifically in the worm gut, which are important considerations for future studies. Taking everything into consideration, we showed that thein silicodesign of targeted supplementation strategies to modulate the microbiome is not only feasible but also promising for the development of future microbiome based treatment.",
