    "abstract": "SNAREs play an important role in the process of membrane trafficking. In the present research, we investigated subcellular localization of an uncharacterizedArabidopsis thalianaprotein reported to interact with atrans Golgi network localized Qa SNARE, SYNTAXIN OF PLANTS 43. Based on the similarity of its amino acid sequence to metazoan fucosyltransferases, we have named this novel protein AtGTLP (Arabidopsis thalianaGlycosylTransferase LikeProtein) and predicted that it should be a member of yet uncharacterized family of Arabidopsis fucosyltransferases, as it shows no significant sequence similarity to fucosyltransferases previously identified in Arabidopsis. AtGTLP is a membrane anchored protein, which exhibits a type II like topology, with a single transmembrane helix and a globular domain in the C terminal part of its amino acid sequence. Colocalization data we collected suggest that AtGTLP should localize mainly to Golgi apparatus, especially to certain zones oftrans Golgi. As singleatgtlp / mutants showed no obvious difference in phenotype (primary root length and fresh mass), AtGTLP and proteins related to AtGTLP with high similarity in amino acid sequences may have redundant functions.\n\nKeywords:glycosylation, Golgi apparatus, membrane trafficking,trans Golgi network",
    "methods": "For colocalization observations, Arabidopsis plants were grown in growth chamber, in 22 degreesC in long day light (16h/8h, L/D) conditions on MS medium w/vitamins (Duchefa Biochemie), containing 0.3% gellan gum (Wako) and 2% sucrose. pH was adjusted to 6.265. Fluorescence was observed in cells in the elongation zone of roots of 5 day old seedlings.\n\nFor analysis of mutant phenotype, two T DNA insertion lines SALK_025999 (atgtlp 1) and SALK_011654 (atgtlp 2) were used. Columbia 0 accession plants were used as a control. Growth conditions and medium were the same as for colocalization analysis. For statistical analysis of primary root length and fresh mass, 25 individuals (11 day old) were used for each genotype.\n\nRNA was extracted from 10 day old Arabidopsis seedling with RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). 100mg of fresh tissue was used for each sample. cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (ThermoFisher Scientific). 5ug of the extracted RNA was added to each reaction as a template. The presence or lack ofAtGTLPexpression in mutant lines was confirmed by PCR reaction using ExTaq polymerase (Takara). 1ug of cDNA was used as a template. Primers used for RT PCR are listed in Supplementary Table S1.\n\nA 5.1kbp fragment of nucleotide sequence comprising of the native promoter andAtGTLP(At2g04280) gene sequence flanked by 5 and 3 UTRs was amplified using PrimeSTAR GXL DNA Polymerase (Takara). The amplified sequence was subsequently subcloned into a pENTR vector using pENTR/D TOPO Vector Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) for directional cloning. The vector was used to transform One Shot TOP10 Chemically CompetentEscherichia coli(ThermoFisher Scientific).\n\nTransformants were selected on solid LB medium with kanamycin 50mgl 1and cultured overnight in liquid LB with the same antibiotic concentration. Isolated plasmid was linearized and fused with monomeric GFP (mGFP) (Segami et al. 2014) gene sequence using In Fusion HD Kit (Takara). Product of this reaction was used to transform competentE. colicells and the transformants selection procedure was repeated. Isolated plasmid was used as the entry clone for pHGW vector (Karimi et al. 2002) as the destination vector in Gateway LR Clonase II reaction (ThermoFisher Scientific).AtGTLP mGFPin pHGW construct was transformed into competentE. colicells and transformant colonies were selected on solid LB medium with 100mgl 1spectinomycin.\n\nFor creation of mRFP GOS12 Golgi marker line, translational fusion betweenmRFP(Campbell et al. 2002) andGOS12were generated by inserting cDNA encodingmRFPin front of the start codon ofGOS12genomic sequence including 1.9kb of the 5 flanking sequence and 1.2kb of the 3 flanking sequence in pENTR vector using In Fusion HD Kit. The resulted mRFP GOS12 construct was subcloned into pGWB1 by LR Clonase II (Nakagawa et al. 2007).\n\nPrimers used for gene cloning and linearization are listed in Supplementary Table S1.\n\nCol 0 plants were infected withAgrobacterium tumefacienstransformed with the prepared plasmid containing theAtGTLP mGFPconstruct using flower dip method (Clough and Bent 1998). Collected seeds were sown on MS medium with 2% sucrose, 0.8% agar with 25mgl 1of hygromycin and 250mgl 1of claforan.\n\nSelection of T1lines with a singleAtGTLP mGFPconstruct was conducted by sowing T2seeds on selective MS medium with hygromycin. Lines, for which we observed 3:1 segregation ratio of resistant to non resistant plants, were selected as single insertion lines.\n\nFor subcellular localization observations of AtGTLP protein, AtGTLP mGFP single insertion lines were cross pollinated with organelle markers lines. mRFP VAMP721 (Uemura et al. 2019) and tagRFP VAMP727 (Ebine et al. 2008) lines were used as markers for transport vesicle from the TGN to the cell plate/plasma membrane or to the vacuole, respectively. mRFP SYP61 (Shimizu et al. 2021), mRFP SYP43 (Asaoka et al. 2013), and VHAa1 mRFP (Dettmer et al. 2006) lines were used as TGN markers. ST mRFP was used as atrans Golgi marker (Uemura et al. 2012) and mRFP GOS12 as a Golgi marker (in this study).\n\nColocalization observations were conducted using Zeiss LSM980 with Airyscan 2 confocal laser scanning microscope system equipped with Plan Apochromat 63x/1.40 Oil DIC M27 immersion objective. Excitation laser wavelengths of 488nm and 543nm were used. Pinhole was set to 1AU.\n\nThe degree of colocalization of each organelle marker with AtGTLP mGFP was assessed by calculating Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) (Adler and Parmryd 2010;Dunn et al. 2011). To obtain PCC values, Coloc 2 plugin for Fiji/ImageJ software (Schindelin et al. 2012) was used. For each organelle marker, three 50umx50um images with 15 randomly selected regions of interest (ROIs), freehand drawn around the observed dot like structures, were used for analysis (45 ROIs total for each marker). Noise in the images was corrected using the 'Smooth' function of Fiji/ImageJ. Line fluorescence intensity plots were generated using RGB profiler plugin for Fiji/ImageJ.",
    "results": "AtGTLP is predicted to be a membrane anchored protein comprising of 568 residues. DeepTMHMM (Hallgren et al. 2022; https://dtu.biolib.com/DeepTMHMM, accessed Nov 1, 2023) transmembrane topology prediction model for this protein indicates a presence of a single transmembrane helix near the N terminus of AtGTLP protein (residues 24 44). The short N terminal tail of the protein was predicted to localize on the cytosolic side of an organelle membrane, while residues 45 568 reside inside the lumen (Figure 1A). AlphaFold2 (Jumper et al. 2021) model of AtGTLP's three dimensional structure includes a globular domain of unknown function in the C terminal part of the amino acid sequence (Figure 1B). The C terminal part of the amino acid sequence was modelled with high confidence, while N terminal part had a lower reliability score (Figure 1C E).\n\nAnalysis of AtGTLP's amino acid sequence using Phyre2server (Kelley et al. 2015; http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/phyre2/html/page.cgi?id=index, accessed Nov 1, 2023) suggests a distant homology between the C terminal domain of AtGTLP and human proteinO fucosyltransferase 2 (POFUT2; 19% of sequence identity, 99.2% confidence), proteinO fucosyltransferase 1 (POFUT1; 16% i.d., 98.9% confidence), as well asC. elegansproteinO fucosyltransferase 2 (CePOFUT2; 20% i.d., 98.9% confidence) and proteinO fucosyltransferase 1 (CePOFUT1; 18% i.d., 99.2% confidence). Superposition between AlphaFold2 model of C terminal domain of AtGTLP and the top ranked template (human POFUT2; PDB ID: 4AP6, A chain) is shown inFigure 1F. Interestingly, among top ranked templates, we observed no plant GTs nor other types of plant enzymes. Moreover, although the Conserved Domain Database (Lu et al. 2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi, accessed Nov 1, 2023) recognizes the presence of 'O FUT like' domain in the C terminal region of AtGTLP, when its amino acid sequence was used as a query in BLAST search against Arabidopsis proteome, none of the 38 proteins that have been characterized as members of Arabidopsis FUT family in literature (Smith et al. 2018) were present among the results. No other motif that could suggest possible functions of AtGTLP has been found to be present in its amino acid sequence. In the CAZy database, AtGTLP is currently classified as 'GTnc'.\n\nTo investigate the subcellular localization of AtGTLP, we established transgenic Arabidopsis expressing mGFP tagged AtGTLP (AtGTLP mGFP) under the control of native promoter. The fluorescence of AtGTLP mGFP protein concentrated in dot  or ring like structures scattered within the cell (Figure 2).\n\nIn order to reveal which organelle those structures correspond to, we established double visualization Arabidopsis lines expressing AtGTLP mGFP with various RFP tagged organelle markers. Among tested markers, the extent of colocalization of AtGTLP withtrans Golgi marker, ST (Boevink et al. 1998) was the highest and relatively consistent among all analyzed ROIs (Figure 3; PCC=0.5 0.91; median=0.75), suggesting that a significant population of AtGTLP localizes totrans Golgi. Visual observations of colocalization of these two proteins show that while both seem to often localize to the same disk like structures, patches of magenta only and green only fluorescence within those structures were also visible (Figure 2A, 'close up'). Based on this characteristic, we suspect that withintrans Golgi, AtGTLP segregates to specific zones only. As expected, relatively high PCCs were obtained also when colocalization with GOS12, a Golgi marker (Figure 2B;Uemura et al. 2004), was analyzed (Figure 3; 0.21 0.83, median=0.58). However, whereas for the AtGTLP mGFP/ST mRFP pair, the two peaks representing GFP and RFP in side view line fluorescence profile of a single disk like structure overlap almost entirely (Figure 4A), for the AtGTLP mGFP/mRFP GOS12 pair a slight shift between those two peaks was observed (Figure 4B).\n\nMoreover, we found that in some of the analyzed ROIs, AtGTLP partially colocalizes with TGN markers, SYP61 (Figure 2C;Uemura et al. 2004) and VHAa1 (Figure 2D;Dettmer et al. 2006), whereas in other ROIs, PCC was close to zero (Figure 3; PCC=0.0 0.65; median=0.41 and PCC= 0.01 0.79; median=0.46, respectively). Side view line fluorescence profiles for these two markers show a similar shift between the GFP and RFP peaks (Figure 4C, D). Interestingly, for the third analyzed TGN marker used in this study, SYP43 (Uemura et al. 2004), we observed that areas where the two colors of florescence overlap with each other, were scarcer (Figure 2E). Relatively low degree of colocalization for AtGTLP mGFP/mRFP SYP43 pair was also reflected in lower PCC values (Figure 3;  0.17 0.64, with median of 0.26) and line fluorescence profile, which suggest that SYP43 localizes to the center of AtGTLP rings (Figure 4E).\n\nTaking into consideration the possibility that AtGTLP is transported within the cell as a cargo, two transport pathway markers VAMP721, a marker of transport from the TGN to the cell plate and the plasma membrane, as well as VAMP727, a marker of vacuolar transport (Shimizu and Uemura 2022) were also included in the study. In case of VAMP721, we observed very little overlap of GFP and RFP fluorescence (Figure 2F,Figure 4F), and low PCCs (Figure 3;  0.48 0.48, median=0.15), whereas colocalization between AtGTLP and VAMP727, similarly to SYP61 and VHAa1, was inconsistent across the analyzed ROIs (Figure 2G,Figure 3; PCC=0.01 0.7, median=0.42). Line fluorescence profiles for AtGTLP GFP/tagRFP VAMP727 pair also show a pattern similar to AtGTLP GFP/mRFP SYP61 pair (Figure 4G). When inspecting the degree of colocalization visually, we observed that the areas of overlapping fluorescence were present mainly within clusters of dot  or ring like structures, which most likely correspond to Golgi/TGN. In addition to these clusters, 'free' dots of tagRFP VAMP727 signal, where AtGTLP mGFP was absent, could also be observed (Figure 2G, arrowheads).\n\nAccording to data available in eFP Browser (Klepikova Arabidopsis Atlas;Klepikova et al. 2016),AtGTLPis expressed in most parts of a plant, including roots and young leaves, with the exception of dry seeds.\n\nIn both mutant lines used in this study, T DNA insertion was confirmed to be present insideAtGTLP's exon (Figure 5A). Although the results of RT PCR confirmed that transcription ofAtGTLPin both of the T DNA lines is absent or reduced to levels undetectable with this method (Figure 5B), growth of mutant plants was comparable to wild type plants, and we could not observe any distinctive phenotype differences betweenatgtlp 1oratgtlp 2single mutants and wild type plants in 8 day old and 11 day old seedlings (Figure 5C, D).",
    "discussion": "In our subcellular localization study, we found that AtGTLP colocalized well with thetrans Golgi marker, ST, as well as with the Golgi marker, GOS12. Based on these results, we consider AtGTLP to be a resident Golgi protein, localizing mainly totrans Golgi. Furthermore, the ring like appearance of AtGTLP mGFP fluorescence suggest that it localizes mainly to the rim of Golgi cisternae (Tie et al. 2018).\n\nThe results of this study showed that the predicted characteristics of AtGTLP match that of glycosyltransferases. In eukaryotic cells, glycosylation processes are commonly thought to occur mainly in ER and Golgi (Hansen et al. 2010). In plants, biosynthesis of many cell wall polysaccharides, another process that involves GTs, was also reported to take place in Golgi (Keegstra and Raikhel 2001;Saint Jore Dupas et al. 2004). Predicted topology model of AtGTLP suggests that it possesses a short cytoplasmic N terminal tail and a single transmembrane helix, while its globular functional domain is positioned inside the lumen. Such topology, often described as 'type II topology' in literature, is common among Golgi resident enzymes known to take part in protein glycosylation processes (Banfield 2011;Hansen et al. 2010;Welch and Munro 2019).\n\nOur data suggest that whilst AtGTLP partially colocalized with TGN markers, SYP61 and VHAa1, and to a lesser extent, SYP43, in a portion of the analyzed ROIs, the number of ROIs, where the Pearson correlation coefficient was close to 0, which suggests no colocalization, is noteworthy. TGN is a vesicular tubular compartment adjacent to thetransside of a Golgi apparatus, but generally considered to be a distinct organelle with functions different from the Golgi (Griffiths and Simons 1986). Indeed, more recently, existence of two types of TGN in plant cells, Golgi associated TGN (GA TGN) and Golgi independent TGN (free TGN/GI TGN) a subpopulation of the TGN that is physiologically separated from Golgi stacks, has been reported (Staehelin and Kang 2008;Uemura et al. 2014;Viotti et al. 2010). The general role of TGN is to receive proteins modified in Golgi and direct them either for vacuoles, the plasma membrane or for secretion (Griffiths and Simons 1986) and therefore, this organelle is considered to be an important hub in the membrane traffic system, where cargo proteins are sorted, before being dispatched for their next destination (Keller and Simons 1997). In addition to TGN resident SNAREs, involved in transport, other TGN localized proteins include lipid processing enzymes, which help to pack cargo proteins into transport vesicles (Gu et al. 2001). Glycosylation is a sequential process, in which different types of sugar are added to glycans in a specific order, as the modified macromolecule travels from ER through Golgi apparatus to finally reach the TGN. In mammalian cells, some types of sugars, such as galactose and sialic acid, can be added to glycans in the TGN by TGN localized GTs (Rabouille et al. 1995;Stanley 2011). In plants, however, there are no reports of glycotransferase activity in the TGN. Based on the collected data, we therefore propose that AtGTLP is atrans Golgi localized protein.\n\nAnalysis of AtGTLP amino acid sequence has shown that its C terminal domain bears resemblance to the conserved domain found in metazoan POFUTs, although no obvious sequence similarity was found between AtGTLP and the proteins which have been previously classified as members of FUT family in Arabidopsis. Although, at present, we lack evidence that would confirm GT or FUT activity in AtGTLP, we consider that this protein may potentially belong to a yet uncharacterized family of Arabidopsis proteins with either GT or FUT activity.\n\nOne interesting possibility that is worth considering is that AtGTLP is indeed a POFUT. Phylogenetic analyses report putative POFUTs in plants and suggest plant POFUTs are phylogenetically distant from POFUTs families in other organisms (POFUT1 and POFUT2 families) (Hansen et al. 2012;Soto et al. 2019). Interestingly however, recently described Arabidopsis putative POFUT,O FUCOSYLTRANSFERASE1 (AtOFT1), implicit in pollen tube penetration through the stigma style interface, was reported to diverge from this pattern. Phylogenetic analysis ofAtOFT1has shown that it exhibits a relatively high sequence identity to members of POFUT1 family, compared to other putative POFUTs found in Arabidopsis (Smith et al. 2018). As in silico analysis suggests that AtGTLP may also be potentially related to metazoan POFUTs, the possibility that yet uncharacterized families of POFUTs, more related to metazoan POFUTs than previously reported POFUTs, exist in Arabidopsis genome is worth further examinations.\n\nIn our subcellular localization study, we found that AtGTLP localizes mainly totrans Golgi. Human POFUT1 and POFUT2 localize to the ER (Luo and Haltiwanger 2005;Luo et al. 2006), where theO glycosylation process for most proteins starts (Stanley 2011). Arabidopsis POFUT with confirmed activity, SPINDY, is known to be active in nucleus/cytoplasm (Bi et al. 2023;Kumar et al. 2023;Zentella et al. 2023). However, it is the only POFUT discovered thus far with this subcellular localization (Sun 2021). On the other hand, putative Arabidopsis POFUTs, such as AtOFT1 (Robichaux et al. 2023;Smith et al. 2018), as well as FRIABLE1 (Neumetzler et al. 2012) and ESMERALDA1 (Verger et al. 2016) were experimentally shown to localize to Golgi. In addition, alpha1,3 fucosylation in sycamore cells, as well as alpha1,4 fucosylation by FUT13 in Arabidopsis was shown to occur mainly intrans Golgi cisternae (Fitchette Lain et al. 1994;Schoberer et al. 2013), suggesting that fucose is available at plant Golgi to be used as a substrate.\n\nIn relation to AtGTLP showing distant similarity to metazoan POFUTs, alternative possibility is that it may be a new type of plant fucosyltransferase. One type of macromolecules, which contain fucose are pectic polysaccharides RG I and RG II. At present, biosynthesis of RG I and RG II is not fully understood, and no specific fucosyltransferase, which could be linked to synthesis of RG I and RG II side chains, has been identified (Soto et al. 2019;Voxeur et al. 2012), suggesting that yet uncharacterized type of fucosyltransferase is present in plants and responsible for this process.\n\nGTs are a diverse family of enzymes and very few members of FUT family in Arabidopsis has been well characterized thus far. Despite the fact that characteristics of AtGTLP, such as itstrans Golgi localization, type II topology and the presence ofO FUT like conserved domain, seem to agree with the assumption that it is a member of the glycosyltransferase family, the data currently available are not enough to conclusively state that AtGTLP is a GT or a type of FUT, precisely. Under standard growth conditions,atgtlp / single mutant displayed phenotype indistinguishable from Col 0 plants and one possible explanation for this result is that AtGTLP and related proteins with high amino acid sequence similarity to AtGTLP might have redundant functions. Protein At4g12700, which shows a very high sequence similarity to AtGTLP is one potential candidate. Further research is needed to confirm the presence of glycosyltransferase/fucosyltranferase activity, as well as the biological role of AtGTLP.",
