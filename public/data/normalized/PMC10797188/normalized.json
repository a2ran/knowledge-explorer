    "abstract": "While fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) and humans exhibit immune system dysfunction in space, studies examining their immune systems' interactions with natural parasites in space are lacking.Drosophilaparasitoid wasps modify blood cell function to suppress host immunity. In this study, naive and parasitized ground and space flies from a tumor free control and a blood tumor bearing mutant strain were examined. Inflammation related genes were activated in space in both fly strains. Whereas control flies did not develop tumors, tumor burden increased in the space returned tumor bearing mutants. Surprisingly, control flies were more sensitive to spaceflight than mutant flies; many of their essential genes were downregulated. Parasitoids appeared more resilient than fly hosts, and spaceflight did not significantly impact wasp survival or the expression of their virulence genes. Previously undocumented mutant wasps with novel wing color and wing shape were isolated post flight and will be invaluable for host parasite studies on Earth.\n\nSubject areas:Parasitology, Biological sciences, Entomology",

Mutant strains will be shared by thelead contactupon request.\n\nOriginal transcriptomic data (raw read counts and FASTQ files) from bulk RNA Seq experiments on hosts and parasites have been deposited in and can be accessed from NASA's publicly available Open Science Data Repository (https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo). Accession numbers are listed in thekey resources table.\n\nVersion D of NASA GeneLab's bioinformatics pipeline, available on GitHub, was used to processDrosophilaRNA Seq reads. A DOI is listed in thekey resources table.\n\nA modified version of theDrosophilapipeline was used to analyzeL.boulardiandL.heterotomareads. Those scripts are available with the supplemental materialData S1(L.boulardi_ L.heterotoma_RNAseq_processing_scripts.zip).\n\nMicroscopy data and any additional information required to reanalyze the data reported in this paper are available from thelead contactupon request.\n\nD.melanogasterstrainsy1w1andy w hopTum lmsn GAL4; UAS mCD8 GFP(hopTum lmsn>GFP),24and wasp speciesL.boulardistrain 17 (Lb17) andL.heterotomastrain 14 (Lh14),8were included in the ground control and flight experiments. ThehopTum lstrain carries a dominant point mutation in the human Janus kinase (JAK) homolog,hopscotch.22This mutation confers constitutive JAK STAT signaling, which drives hematopoietic proliferation and differentiation in larval stages; small, melanized tumors form that can be scored in adult flies. In this strain, themisshapen(msn) promoter directs Gal4 expression to lamellocytes.62Expression of theUAS mCD8 GFPtransgene helps visualize lamellocytes, which make up the bulk of the tumors.\n\nExtensive pre flight testing was done to estimate the diet volume and insect numbers for optimal growth during the 34 day flight period. Six conditions (two fly only cultures, four fly/wasp co cultures) were distributed among six VFBs (Figure1). The fly only cultures were reared in polystyrene vials containing 12mL+/  1mL fly food, while the co culture vials contained 10mL+/  1mL fly food. The difference in fly food volume accommodated the respective life histories of the two insect species; unlike flies that depend on fly food medium, wasps consume the growing fly larvae and pupae. This volume of fly food supported insect growth for 34days while keeping carbon dioxide production to a minimum.\n\nPrior to launch,y wfly only cultures were initiated with 8 female and 5 male flies. ThehopTum lcultures were similarly initiated with 20 female and 10 male flies. Fly wasp co cultures were set up simultaneously by first adding the flies to vials for three days, whereupon the flies were removed and adult wasps introduced. For they wco cultures, 30 adult females and 15 adult males were added to each polystyrene vial for egg laying. ForhopTum legg lays, 35 females and fifteen males were used. Fifteen egg lays were made for each genotype, and 15 female and 15 male wasps were added to each egg lay a day prior to launch.\n\nSix VFBs, each with 15 vials, were placed inside a CTB before the launch of the SpaceX 14 mission to the ISS (Figure1). The mission was launched at 20:30UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) on April 2nd, 2018. Wasp infection modifies fly development; it takes 20 25days for wasps to develop into adults, while naive flies complete their development in 10 15days. Weather related issues delayed the original mission time from 31days to 34days. The ISS crew installed the samples into the Columbus Module endcone with the CTB lid open to promote air exchange between the VFBs and cabin air, where they remained until approximately two days prior to their return to Earth. Samples remained at ambient temperature (22 degreesC). Temperature and humidity data in each VFB were collected throughout the flight mission. The radiation dosimeter on the ISS was the COL1A2 Radiation Assessment Detector, ISS RAD, that detects charged particles.63Insects remained in the VFBs throughout the mission until their return on the Dragon capsule.\n\nA full scale, near synchronous ground control was conducted that was staggered 48h from launch, using the environmental data streamed to a Space Station Processing Facility Environmental Simulator at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC). The ground control samples were manually set to recapitulate the temperature and humidity conditions of the space samples. While the temperatures between space and ground samples were similar for the duration of the experiment, the relative humidity of space samples was higher by 20 25% than that of ground samples. This was attributed to reduced convection in the microgravity environment, making it more difficult for moisture to evaporate quickly. The Dragon capsule was unberthed at 13:22UTC on May 5th, 2018, and splashdown in the Pacific Ocean occurred on the same day at 20:00, off the coast of Long Beach, CA, from where samples were flown to New York. Ground control samples were similarly collected from KSC and flown to New York.\n\nVisual inspection of the cultures indicated that most of the fly food in all vials was consumed, and there was no apparent evidence of mold or other microbial infection in any culture vial. G0 and S0 fly only vials of both genetic backgrounds did not contain sufficient early instar larvae to set up wasp infections. (G1/S1 larval hosts were used instead for infection experiments.) Almost all adult wasps retrieved from G0/S0 cultures developed under corresponding conditions, while adult fly samples contained individuals of mixed age and from 2 to 3 generations. For all studies, appropriate numbers of animals were randomly selected from different vials.\n\nAnimals in each vial were sorted and scored under a dissecting microscope immediately upon arrival. For fly only cultures, statistical analysis was performed on counts after excluding counts from vials where sample counts were incomplete. For co cultures, statistical analysis was performed on the number of flies and wasps after excluding vials where either no insects developed or where sample counts were incomplete. The percentage of female wasps was obtained by dividing the number of female wasps by the total number of wasps in each vial.\n\nDepending on sample availability, 5 15 animals were dissected to examine lymph glands. Methods for larval lymph gland dissections, staining, and imaging were previously published.64,65,66,67Lymph glands were counter stained with rhodamine labeled phalloidin (R415 Life Technologies) and Hoechst 33258 pentahydrate (Invitrogen). ForLh infected G1 or S1 larvae, primary mouse anti p40 antibody9,20(1:1000) was used. Fixed and stained samples were imaged on the Laser Scanning Zeiss 710 or 800 confocal microscopes controlled with Zeiss Zen imaging software in the CCNY core facilities. Whole insects were imaged with a Leica MZFLIII attached to an Optronics camera. Images were collected using the Magnafire SP software.\n\nThree day egg lays of G0/S0hopTum ladult flies (described above) were set up at 25 degreesC. Three to five wandering third instar larvae were used per hemocyte smear for each replicate; three biological replicates were performed. Samples were incubated with rabbit anti phospho histone H3 antibody (1:200, Millipore Sigma), which was visualized with goat anti rabbit alkaline phosphatase linked secondary antibody (1:5000, Thermo Scientific). Antibody binding was visualized by alkaline phosphatase staining (125ug/mL BCIP and 250ug/mL NBT, from Promega). The percentage of phospho histone H3 positive macrophages was calculated by dividing the number of phospho histone H3 positive macrophages by the total number of macrophages over six visual fields. Cells were scored using a Zeiss Axioplan light microscope.\n\nTumors in randomly chosen G0 and S0hopTum ladults (20 males and 5 10 females, 22 degreesC) were scored 6.5days (25 degreesC) after their return. The G1 and S1 progeny of these G0 and S0hopTum lflies was reared at 27 degreesC, and their abdominal tumors were similarly scored 18.5days post egg lay.24Using a dissecting microscope, abdominal tumors were categorized as follows: small (< 0.5 body segment), medium (0.5 1 body segment), and large (> 1 body segment). Small , medium , and large sized tumors were arbitrarily weighed as 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and all tumors in each animal were recorded. The average number of tumor structures per animal was determined by dividing the sum of all tumors in each replicate by the total number of animals scored. Three biological replicates were performed for both S0/G0 and S1/G1 comparisons. A Student'sttest was used to determine if the averages of two datasets differed significantly from each other.\n\nEgg lays of G0/S0hopTum lflies were set up with the same number of flies used in flight. Larval progeny, raised at 25 degreesC for 3days, were exposed to 10 male and 10 female G0 and S0Lb17orLh14wasps for 8 h. For each condition, hosts of the same strain were taken from more than one vial to randomize samples and ensure robust egg laying. Similarly, wasps of the same species from different vials were combined for infections. Each experiment was replicated 3 4 times.\n\nInfected larvae were randomly selected and examined under a dissecting microscope 3 5days later for the presence of either melanotic tumors or melanized parasite induced encapsulation reactions.hopTum ltumors and parasite capsules differ in shape; tumors are globular, while capsules are typically sickle shaped and surround a wasp egg or wasp larva. These structures can fragment into smaller, melanized pieces, making it difficult to distinguish them. Regardless of their identity, they were classified based on size: (a)specks (similar in appearance to melanized crystal cells), (b)small melanized structures, or (c)large melanized structures. To quantify spaceflight's effects on these reactions, an arbitrary score was assigned as follows: 1 3 specks, 4 8 specks, and > 8 specks were assigned a value of 0.5, 0.75, or 1, respectively. Small  and large melanized structures were assigned a value of 1 and 4, respectively. Where clear encapsulation reactions (with evidence of a wasp egg) were observed, the structure was also assigned a value of 4. A composite tumor and encapsulation (T+ E) score was calculated from 16 to 29 G1/S1 Lb17 or Lh14 infectedhopTum llarvae. Uninfected G1/S1hopTum llarvae (70 89 animals) served as controls. Pairwise comparisons of the average T+ E scores were made using the Mann Whitney U test for unpaired samples.\n\nFor RNA Seq experiments (technique reviewed in68), samples were flash frozen in dry ice and stored at  80 degreesC. Bulk RNA Seq analysis was performed on RNA prepared from four replicates of (a)ground control (G0) and space flown (S0) adult flies; (b) G0 and S0 adult wasps; and (c) G1 and S1 larvae. The RNA/protein purification plus kit from Norgen Biotek Corp. was used for RNA preparation, and the extracted total RNA was stored in Norgen RNA isolation kit elution buffer.\n\nFor adult flies, three males and females each, of (a) G0y w; (b) S0y w; (c) G0hopTum l; (d) S0hopTum lwere used for extraction. RNA preparations of G0 and S0Lb17andLh14wasps were made from three females and three males. Larval RNA was isolated from G1 and S1y wanimals. In addition, RNA was also extracted fromhopTum llarvae as follows: (a)uninfected G1; (b)uninfected S1; (c) G0Lb infected G1 hosts; (d) S0Lb infected G1 hosts; (e) G0Lb infected S1 hosts; (f) S0Lb infected S1 hosts; (g) G0Lh infected G1 hosts; (h) S0Lh infected G1 hosts; (i) G0Lh infected S1 hosts; and (j) S0Lh infected S1 hosts.\n\nThe RNA from G0 and S0 adult flies and wasps was processed at Genewiz, Inc. as follows: After poly (A)+ extraction, libraries for adult flies and wasps were prepared using the non stranded NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit E7775, following the manufacturer's instructions (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA). The libraries were validated using the Agilent TapeStation. Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 machine for HiSeq 2x150bp, single index, at Genewiz. Data output was 300 350 million raw paired end reads per lane.\n\nThe total RNA prepared from G1 and S1 larval samples (stored at  80 degreesC) was processed as follows at NASA's GeneLab Samples Processing Laboratory. The RNA concentration was determined using a Qubit 4.0 Fluorometer, and 400ng of each sample was used for poly (A)+ extraction. RNA Seq sequencing libraries were prepared using the E7775 NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit, as above. The libraries were validated by using Agilent TapeStation D1000 tape. Quantification was performed using the Qubit 4.0 Fluorometer. Libraries were pooled and sequenced on the Illumina iSeq 100 sequencer to confirm library balancing and screen for ribosomal RNA. The final library pool was sequenced on Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer using S1 Reagent Kit v1.5 (300 cycles, 2 lanes).\n\nThe reads from adult fly and larval fly RNA were analyzed using version D of NASA GeneLab's RNA Seq processing pipeline (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL DPPD 7101_Versions/GL DPPD 7101 D.md). For this, the raw fastq files of the adult fly RNA Seq reads obtained from Genewiz were transferred to GeneLab. Raw fastq files of both sample sets were assessed for percent rRNA (0.30 0.42% rRNA in adults; 0.20 2.73% rRNA in larvae) using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) and filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 2.6). Raw and trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.11) was used to generate MultiQC reports.\n\nD.melanogasterSTAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.8a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 101, genome version BDGP6.28 (Drosophila_melanogaster.BDGP6.28.dna.toplevel.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Drosophila_melanogaster.BDGP6.28.101.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Drosophila melanogaster STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.8a). A majority (90.08% 94.47%) of trimmed reads mapped uniquely to the fly reference genome. Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using the RSeQC Infer Experiment (version 4.0.0) and determined to be unstranded. Then aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to none.\n\nRSEM raw gene counts were imported to R (version 4.0.3) with tximport (version 1.18.0) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.30.0)69median of ratios method. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.0.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.30.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test, and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p value. False discovery rate (adjusted p value) corrections were performed using Benjamini Hochberg multiple testing adjustment. Gene annotations were assigned using the following Bioconductor and annotation packages: STRINGdb (v2.2.0), PANTHER.db (v1.0.10), and org.Dm.e.g.,.db (v3.12.0). Genes were considered differentially expressed if adjusted p<0.05 and |log2FC|>1.\n\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed in R (version 4.0.3) using log (2) transformed count data from unnormalized and normalized counts. PCA plots were generated for each set of count data using ggplot2 (version 3.3.3). Volcano plots were created using EnhancedVolcano (version 1.8.0), with adjusted p<0.05 and |log2FC|>1 cutoff values specified.\n\nDEGs in adult fly samples (adjusted p value < 0.05 and |log2FC|>1) were used for analysis. Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG enrichment analyses were performed using the Bioconductor package ClusterProfiler v 3.18.070and theDrosophiladatabase (org.Dm.e.g.,.db version 3.13). EnrichGO and EnrichKEGG functions were used to determine functionally enriched GO categories for KEGG pathways and molecular function.71Results were visualized by R package.72\n\nThe most highly modulated Top DEGs in the adult fly samples were identified by sorting log (2) FC for each comparison and then filtering genes that met the adjusted p value significance p<0.05 and |log2FC|>1. From this list, the top 50 upregulated or downregulated genes were identified for each comparison, yielding 280 genes. Annotations and other functional information for these 280 genes were examined in FlyBase37and genes with clear orthologs or paralogs and known or predicted functions (172 genes) were retained. Clustering of these 172 Top DEGs revealed six major expression profiles. The magnitude of log (2) FC for these genes, in both directions, ranged from 3  to 12 fold.\n\nFor Essential DEGs, a list of 1,024 genes that were identified experimentally in P element insertion screens was compiled.73,74,75,76Of these 1,024 genes, 137 were differentially expressed in at least one of four comparisons. The DIOPT DIST tool,41which predicts human orthologs of fly genes and diseases or traits associated with the human orthologs identified through GWAS or OMIM databases, was used to determine the disease relevance of these essential genes. Genes in the JAK STAT, Toll, and Imd pathways were compiled from KEGG and/or FlyBase. Additional pathway target genes were added from the primary literature.34,77,78\n\nFor larval samples, gene set enrichment analysis of larval RNA Seq results did not highlight immune changes, and hence the results of this analysis were not included here. Gene expression changes were examined in the context of signaling pathways as was done for the adult RNA Seq results above.\n\nRaw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 3.7). Raw and trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports.L.heterotomaBowtie2 and RSEM indices were built using Bowtie2 (version 2.5.0) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, and theLh14GAJC contig transcriptome reference from NCBI (https://sra download.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/traces/wgs03/wgs_aux/GA/JC/GAJC01/GAJC01.1.fsa_nt.gz).L.boulardiBowtie2 and RSEM indices were built using Bowtie2 (version 2.5.0) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, withLb17GAJA contig transcriptome reference from NCBI (https://sra download.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/traces/wgs03/wgs_aux/GA/JA/GAJA01/GAJA01.1.fsa_nt.gz).\n\nTrimmed reads were aligned to the respective wasp parasite species Bowtie2 transcriptome reference with Bowtie2 (version 2.5.0), and aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to none. Quantification data was imported to R (version 4.1.2) with tximport (version 1.22.0) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) using the median of ratios method. Normalized transcript counts were subject to differential expression analysis in R (version 4.1.2) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared using the Wald test, and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p value. The numbers of significantly differentially expressed transcripts (adjusted p<0.05 and |log2FC|>1) forLb17andLh14were 293 and 310, respectively. The presence of conserved protein domains or motifs in these differentially expressedLb17andLh14DEGs was performed via CDD searches (database version CDD v3.20   59693 PSSMs; and expect value threshold 0.01) (TablesS2andS3).\n\nPrincipal Component Analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.2) using log (2) transformed count data from unnormalized and normalized counts. PCA plots were generated for each set of count data using ggplot2 (version 3.3.5). Volcano plots were created using EnhancedVolcano (version 1.12.0) with an adjusted p value < 0.05 and |log2FC|>1 cutoff values specified.\n\nProteins from purifiedLb17EV have not been characterized, but the composition of purified EVs from theLbGotheron (LbG) strain is published.14To identify differentially expressedLb17EV transcripts in space corresponding to these previously characterized 383LbGEV proteins, we queried theLbGEV protein sequences against all 293 differentially expressedLb17transcripts in space (TableS2;LbGEV query sequences were kindly provided by J. Varaldi, University of Lyon). For this, NCBI's tblastn tool was used at default settings (BLOSUM62; gap costs existence extension 1, filtered for low complexity regions, January 2023). Results where E value <=1 e 30, query coverage >=50%, and percent identity of >=50% were scored as high confidence homologs and included 27 sequences. Two sequences did not meet these criteria but were added to our results (Table1), either due to their high log (2) FC value (GAJA01001411.1; E= 3.00 e 100, query coverage 96%, and % identity 32.49), or due to interesting homology (GAJA01009829.1; E= 4.00 e 30, query coverage 57%, and % identity 32.69).\n\nAn estimate of the overallLb17EV proteome size was obtained as follows: the 383LbGsequences were used to tblastn search theGAJA00000000sequences.47This search identified 316 non redundant EV protein encoding GAJA sequences (E <= 1 e 50, query coverage >=70%, percent identity >=70%; NCBI BLAST+ (v 2.7.1).15,79,80,81Some homologs were not identified due to strain differences; nevertheless, the analysis revealed that most of theLbGEV proteins are expressed in theLb17female abdomen. Since theLh14EV proteome is already characterized,11,12tblastn analyses were not necessary, and EV genes were filtered from the 310Lh14DEGs (Table2).\n\nThirty venom glands of G0 and S0 wasps were dissected in 100uL of ice cold PBS and fixed in 100uL of 4% glutaraldehyde in 0.1M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4 (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Venom glands were processed for scanning electron microscopy imaging as follows: Ten drops of 2% osmium tetroxide aqueous solution (Electron Microscopy Sciences) were added to the sample on ice for 20min. The sample was filtered on a wet 25 mm polycarbonate Whatman membrane filter (0.1um pore size), covered with a second wet filter, and suctioned with the sample in between the filters. The filters were clamped between O rings and quickly immersed in ice cold distilled water. The filters were then rinsed in distilled water five times, 3min for each rinse. This was followed by dehydration in a graded (10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 100%) series of ethanol for 5min each. The filters were then critical point dried (Balzers, CPD 030) in liquid carbon dioxide five times, 3 5min each. Dehydrated and dried samples were mounted on aluminum SEM specimen mount stubs (Electron Microscopy Sciences) using conductive carbon adhesive tabs (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and stored in a 60 degreesC oven for 2h or longer. Samples on the filter were coated with gold/palladium (Leica, EM ACE600) right before being observed on the Zeiss SUPRA 55VP scanning electron microscope. These procedures were carried out at the CCNY and CUNY ASRC core facilities.\n\nFortyhopTum llarvae were bled in 200uL of 7% bovine serum albumin. 50uL of this hemolymph preparation was aliquoted into individual chambers of a 4 chamber slide and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 1 h. Venom was extracted from G0 and S0Lh14wasps, and protein was quantified using the Bradford method. An appropriate volume of the venom extract containing 30ug of venom protein was added to the slide chamber withhopTum lhemocytes. Phosphate buffered saline (20mM, pH 7.4) was used as a control. After incubation for 4h at 25 degreesC, excess liquid was removed by aspiration, hemocytes were air dried at room temperature and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10min. After washing, cells were stained successively with rhodamine labeled phalloidin (R415 Life Technologies) and Hoechst 33258 pentahydrate (Invitrogen) for 15min each at room temperature. Samples were washed three times with PBS, and stained cells were mounted in Vectashield for confocal microscopy. Lamellocytes with bipolar morphology (i.e., spindle shaped GFP positive lamellocytes with two pointed ends) were manually scored. Experiments were replicated three times and the Student'sttest statistic was applied to determine the significance.\n\nG0/S0Lb17andLh14male wasps were mated with females from lab cultures, and their grandsons were examined for viable mutations affecting wing color, wing venation, wing morphology, eye color, eye morphology, and antennal morphology. Mutant grandsons were not obtained from the G0/S0Lb17or G0Lh14screens. OneLh14grandson with golden wings (instead of the normal gray wings) was identified. Thisaurum1male was mated with \"lab\" females; the progeny was \"selfed\" to obtain additional mutant males. For a pure breeding stock, putative heterozygous unmated females were collected by placing pupae into Falcon 3072 96 well plates (Becton Dickinson) 1 3days prior to their emergence. Strips of Scotch Tape (0.9cm wide) were used to seal the wells. Theaurum1strain was homozygous viable, and a pure breeding stock was established.\n\nA second mutant phenotype was observed in theaurum1wasp culture. The posterior wing margins of thisaurum1wasp were angular instead of the normal round ends. This mutant,kona1, assorted from theaurum1mutation, and was similarly homozygous viable but a pure breeding stock could not be established as homozygouskona1females could not infect hosts. To establish this, 14 unmated, or 11kona1male mated, heterozygous or homozygouskona1females, were introduced toy whosts. Ten males were used for the matings. Larval hosts were dissected to assess the presence of eggs.\n\nTo examine ifaurum1andkona1mutations assort independently, unmated homozygousaurum1females were mated withkona1males. Thirty six unmated double heterozygous females were used for two rounds ofy winfections. Over 1,000 male progeny of the four expected genotypes were scored.\n\nOvaries from wild type, heterozygous, or homozygouskona1females were fixed in ethanol, mounted in 50% glycerol, and imaged on a Nikon Eclipse TE2000 U microscope attached to a Diagnostic Instruments Inc. camera and NIS Elements Imaging Software 64.0 bit 3.22.14. Ovipositors of 10 wild type and 30 homozygouskona1females were gently pulled out using sharp forceps, briefly dipped in 70% ethanol and PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and washed in PBS, before mounting in Vectashield. Images were acquired with a Leica Aperio CS2 microscope.\n\nSample size, experimental replication, and data analysis of results are also described in the corresponding sections above and/or the corresponding figure legend. ForFigures2andS9, each experimental vial was considered a replicate, and statistical analysis of insect survival in space relative to ground after their return to the lab was performed in Microsoft Excel 2016. The mean numbers (+/  standard error) of flies and/or wasps from 14 vials were calculated in Microsoft Excel (2016). Student'sttest statistic was applied, and the difference between the corresponding space versus ground samples was significant if p<0.05. For the data inFigures6D and 6E, the weighted average number of tumors per animal in S0 versus G0 flies, or S1 versus G1 flies, was calculated in Microsoft Excel. The mean+/  standard error was calculated, and a Student'sttest was used to determine biological significance. ForFigure7B, the non parametric Mann Whitney U test for unpaired samples was performed to compare all conditions pairwise. p values < 0.05 were considered significant. ForFigure9H, more than 1,000 F2 males were scored from unmated dihybrid females, and the raw numbers obtained are shown. A standard chi square test was applied to accept the null hypothesis. ForFigure9I, at least 30 larvae per condition were dissected and scored for signs of infection. ForFigureS11, the means of the proportion of bipolar cells in theL.heterotomavirulence assay were compared in experimental versus control samples using Excel and a Student'sttest. Between 129 and 1,146 lamellocytes were scored per replicate. For differential gene expression analysis in R using DESeq2, all groups were compared using the Wald test. To generate the F statistic p value and false discovery rate (adjusted p value), the likelihood ratio test was used. Corrections for multiple testing adjustment were performed using Benjamini Hochberg. Genes were considered differentially expressed if adjusted p<0.05 and |log2FC|>1.",
    "results": "LbandLhfemales attack their larval hosts, introducing one or more egg and venom into the host's body cavity. Depending on the host's ability to defend itself and the wasp's ability to overcome host defenses, one of the two insects emerges alive from the host's puparium (Figure1A). To study the effects of spaceflight on this host parasite scuffle, naive hosts orLb17 /Lh14 infected hosts were held in ventilated fly boxes (VFBs); these fly boxes were then placed into a cargo transfer bag (CTB) aboard the ISS or at the ground facility tracking ISS conditions (Figures1B and 1C). The FFL 03 experimental design consisted of two fly only cultures (fly strainsy wandy w,hopTum l) and four fly/parasite co cultures on each host strain (Figure1D). Survival of animals was scored post flight (seeSTAR Methods).\n\nThe FFL 03 experimental design\n\n(A)D.melanogasteradults (top left) and larva (bottom left) imaged together with parasitoid wasps (bottom right).

Samples in the CTB were placed in the ISS by the crew.

SeeSTAR methodsfor more details.\n\nWe found that the overall yield of both male and femaley wflies in each vial was roughly half of that of the ground reared flies (Figures2A 2C; FFL 03 ground control and space samples retrieved post flight are referred to as G0 and S0, respectively). The trend was somewhat different for thehopTum lanimals that did not appear to suffer from the effects of spaceflight; while spaceflight actually favored male viability slightly but significantly (average 44 versus 57 males/vial), female development remained unaffected (Figures2A 2C). Thus, under the FFL 03 experimental protocol, animals of the two genetic backgrounds responded differently to spaceflight, underscoring the complex interplay of these factors. There was no significant difference in the yields of flies and wasps from the fly/wasp co culture vials (Figures2D and 2E).\n\nSurvival of flies and wasps in ground control (G0) and space (S0) samples\n\n(A C) The average numbers of adult male (A), adult female (B), and all adult (C)flies per vial in naivey wandhopTum lcultures.

See alsoFigureS9.\n\nTo understand the molecular basis of the effects of spaceflight on flies, we analyzed bulk RNA sequencing (RNA Seq) gene expression results in naive adult flies. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were defined as adjusted p<0.05 and |log2Fold Change (FC)|>1. The close clustering of the four replicates and high variation among the four sample types in the principal component analysis (PCA) show that the experiment was well controlled (FigureS1A). Overall, they wstrain was more sensitive to spaceflight thanhopTum l, with 13.22% versus 6.78% DEGs (spaceflight versus ground control samples), respectively (TableS1), a difference that is also reflected in the PCA plot (FigureS1A). A separate RNA Seq analysis of white eyed (w1118) flies, also on the SpaceX 14 mission, reported 6.49% and 3.25% DEGs in S0 versus G0 female and male fly heads, respectively (false discovery rate [FDR] adjusted p values < 0.05; total number of genes expressed was 13,99133). Although the sample types in the two studies are different, these results suggest that they wstrain is more sensitive to space conditions than they w hopTum land thew1118strains. On Earth, thehopTum lstrain showed 9.69% DEGs relative toy w, with more than two thirds of DEGs upregulated and the remaining DEGs downregulated. In space, this differential expression was enhanced (14.03% of genes affected), but the proportion of upregulated versus downregulated genes was roughly equal (TableS1).\n\nVolcano plots of the four comparisons revealed distinct gene identity profiles in each comparison (FiguresS1B S1E). This distinction between the strains is also clearly evident from Gene Ontology based Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis showing active Toll/Imd (immune deficiency) signaling not only in naive G0hopTum lcompared toy wflies but, surprisingly, also in S0y wandhopTum lflies, relative to their G0 counterparts (FigureS2A). Furthermore, for these same three comparisons, the top 20 significantly enriched (adjusted p value < 0.05) Gene Ontology terms in Biological Process enrichment analyses included host defense terms such as response to bacterium, response to other organism, and response to biotic stimulus (FigureS2B). These four comparisons allowed us to decouple the effects of genetic strain differences in the S0/G0 culture conditions. We next examined changes in expression patterns of the most significantly DEGs (Top DEGs), genes essential to fly viability (Essential DEGs), and immune genes in the JAK/STAT and Toll/Imd pathways (Pathway DEGs), as summarized inFigureS1F.\n\nWe analyzed 172 annotated Top DEGs (seeSTAR methodsfor selection of Top DEGs) and identified six profiles described here in two broad categories (Figures3A 3F). In the first category (Figures3A and 3B), we consider the Top DEGs showing differential expression in the two fly strains as follows. (a) Top DEGs upregulated in G0hopTum lversus G0y wthat maintain their expression patterns in space (S0hopTum lversus S0y w) include genes annotated for stress  and immune related peptides (Tot and Tep family members), proteases, and endopeptidases (Figure3A). (b) The Top DEGs downregulated in G0hopTum lversus G0y wthat maintain their expression patterns in space (S0hopTum lversus S0y w) include members of the lysozyme gene family, histone H4 genes, serine proteases, carboxypeptidases, and other enzymes (Figure3B). Exceptions to both of these trends were also observed (Figures3A and 3B). These results define strong differences in DEG patterns inhopTum landy wflies. They also show that the molecular gene expression differences between two genetic strains, for many but not all genes, are maintained in spaceflight conditions.\n\nDifferential expression of Top DEGs in S0/G0 adult flies\n\n(A and B) Top DEGs upregulated (A)or downregulated (B)in G0hopTum lvs. G0y w. Most genes in panel A that maintain differential expression in space are Toll pathway target genes34,35(TotMandTep1family members,SPH93, andCG18563).Lectin 24Ais predicted to bind galactose, and its human homolog is associated with the 3MC syndrome 3.36Notable DEGs in panel (B)with disease relevant human orthologs areCG32379,CG32318, andCG30059.37\n\n(C and D) Comparisons showing differential expression of upregulated (C)and downregulated (D)genes in S0y wversus G0y w. Cuticle related and chorion family genes are included in these profiles. The flyhistone H1s (orthologous to the human H1 gene, implicated in acute lymphoblastic leukemia38) andCG6431, a triacylglycerol hydrolase (orthologous to several human disease genes implicated in cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes), are downregulated (D).\n\n(E) Genes inhopTum lwhose expression is activated in space. Cuticle related and chorion family genes are included in this profile.CG3108is predicted to enable metallocarboxypeptidase activity, whose human orthologs are implicated in familial febrile seizures 11 and familial temporal lobe epilepsy 5.37\n\n(F) Genes iny wandhopTum lwhose expression is downregulated in space. Cuticle related and flight related genes are included. Flight related genes areCG34327(associated with abnormal flight),flightin(fln), andTroponin C isoform 4(TpnC4). See alsoFigureS1.\n\nIn the second broad category, we consider the effects of spaceflight on Top DEGs in individual strains as follows (Figures3C 3F). (a) Top DEGs upregulated in S0y w, when compared to the respective ground control group (i.e., G0y w), encode (i)structural proteins for cuticle (e.g., chitin binding domain containing proteins of the Twdl, CPLCA, and Cpr families) and (ii) proteins with the GYR/YLP domain or immune response related proteins (Figure3C). (b) Top DEGs downregulated in S0y wflies but not in S0hopTum lflies, when compared to respective ground control groups, include members of theyellowgene family (yellow g,yellow g2,yellow e3),beardedgene family (Brd,Tom,BobA),Histone H1s, and several genes for chorion constituents and chorion assembly (e.g.,Cp7Fb,Cp7Fc,Cp16,Cp19,Cp36,Cp38,Mur11Da;Figure3D). TheseCpgenes are clustered on the X and third chromosomes, and the gene clusters are selectively amplified in the follicle cells of the ovary.39(c) Top DEGs upregulated in S0hopTum l, when compared to the respective ground control group (G0hopTum l), includeCprfamily genes,Osirisfamily genes,tracheal prostasin(tpr), a protein important for sleep regulation (nemuri,nur), andCG3108(Figure3E). (d) Top downregulated DEGs in S0 versus G0 flies of both genetic backgrounds include several cuticle related (CPLCA, CPLCP) families and flight related genes (e.g.,flightin[fln] andTroponin C isoform 4[TpnC4];Figure3F). Chitin supports the epidermal and tracheal cuticles and the peritrophic matrices that line the gut while the chorion makes up the egg shell. These comparative RNA Seq results suggest that matrisome genes of many multigene families that encode proteins of theDrosophilacuticle40are sensitive to spaceflight.\n\nTo further understand the differential effects of spaceflight on fly survival, we examined the expression of 1,024 essential genes that have been identified in genetic experiments as indispensable for life (seeSTAR methods). Across the four comparisons, we found 137 essential genes to be differentially expressed (adjusted p<0.05 and |log2FC|>1). Strikingly, the space environment had a profound effect on the differential expression of these genes between the two genetic backgrounds. For example, in G0hopTum lversus G0y wsamples, only 15 differentially expressed essential genes were either upregulated (11 genes) or downregulated (4 genes), whereas spaceflight conditions affected the transcription of 95 genes in the S0hopTum lversus S0y wcomparison (81 genes upregulated, 14 genes downregulated,Figure4A).\n\nDifferential expression of essential genes in S0/G0 adult flies\n\n(A) The expression of 137 genes essential to fly viability that were differentially expressed (adjusted p<0.05 and |log2FC|>1) in one or more comparisons is shown.\n\n(B) Expression of 34 genes pertinent to human health. The DIOPT category and score relevant human disease or trait linked to the human ortholog were determined using theDrosophilaRNAi Screening Center Integrative Ortholog Prediction Tool.41The disease/trait category for the fly gene refers to at least one human disease or trait linked to one or more human ortholog. MS, musculoskeletal; DN, development/neurological; MO, metabolic /obesity related; S, skin related; P, pulmonary; IA, infection and/or autoimmune; C, coronary /cardiac related.\n\n(C) The differential expression of essential genes with no human ortholog or none to low disease relevance. See alsoFigureS1.\n\nThe most striking effects of spaceflight were seen iny wflies: 96 genes were either upregulated (24 genes) or downregulated (72 genes) iny wspace flown samples compared to the respective ground control samples. The most strongly upregulated DEGs of these 96 DEGs, with log2 (FC)>2, includeCpr65Ec(cuticular protein), CG15784, and CG30457 (both latter genes lack annotation). The most highly downregulated genes are S1A serine proteaseNotopleuraland histone H1His1:CG31617, with log2 (FC)< 1.9. Remarkably, gene expression changes were milder in space flownhopTum lsamples, with the expression of only 10 genes significantly affected; either 2 genes were upregulated or 8 genes were downregulated, compared to respective ground control samples (Figure4A). These results likely explain whyy wflies were more sensitive to spaceflight thanhopTum lflies.\n\nTo assess why S0y wflies were sensitive to spaceflight and if they have relevance to human conditions, we filtered the 137 essential DEGs for a DIOPT (Drosophila RNAi Screening Center Integrative Ortholog Prediction Tool) score of at least 12 and identified 34 high scoring DEGs that we grouped into broad categories. Strikingly, we observed 22 DEGs that were significantly downregulated in S0y wversus G0y wflies.Oseg5andBiotinidaseexpression was downregulated in G0hopTum lversus G0y wflies; for both genes, this downregulation was maintained in space. Only two genes,veilandmelt, showed significant upregulation (Figure4B). This analysis revealed that human orthologs of these 34 fly genes affect many aspects of human physiology (seeFigure4B for details). The remaining 17 essential DEGs, with a low DIOPT value (i.e., < 12), were annotated with enzymatic, developmental, or unknown functions. The most significantly upregulated genes inhopTum lversusy wflies werel(2)03659(enables organic anion transporter activity) andIr40a(involved in response to humidity changes),42both maintaining differential expression in space. In addition, six DEGs, each in S0y wflies and S0hopTum lflies, were either upregulated or downregulated, relative to their corresponding ground controls (Figure4C).\n\nA comparison of the Gene Ontology based pathway and Biological Process enrichment terms associated with they wversushopTum ltranscriptional profiles provided a \"big picture\" view of the differential effects of space on the two strains. Both plots show that, while most GO terms and almost all biological processes are affected iny wflies, only a few parameters change in both strains. Most notable of these are the Toll/Imd pathway and lysosomal pathway terms that are significantly enriched in the space samples for both genotypes, suggesting the activation of inflammation related genes in space (FiguresS2A and S2B).\n\nSince thehopTum lmutant fly strain carries a constitutively active JAK enzyme,43the transcriptional activation of known JAK STAT target genes is expected inhopTum lflies relative toy wflies without this mutation. Consistent with this expectation we found many target genes (Idgf1, SOCS36E,TotA,CG3829, CG4793,CG13559, andCG10764) to be differentially upregulated in G0hopTum lversus G0y wflies. High levels of JAK STAT pathway genesTotA,diedel,et, andCG4793inhopTum lversusy wwere maintained in space (Figure5A). Similarly, several Toll pathway components (PGRPs SA, SB1, and SD, grass, SPE) and target genes were significantly upregulated in G0hopTum lversus G0y wflies (Figures5B 5E).\n\nDifferentially expressed immune signaling genes in S0/G0 adult flies\n\n(A) JAK STAT pathway components and target genes are shown based on fold induction. Genes were grouped based on their annotation in FlyBase37as follows:upd2andupd3are ligands;CycD,CycE, andCdk2are positive regulators;diedel,Socs36E, andetare negative regulators. The target genes areTotA,Idgf1,pirk,mfas,CG3829,CG4793,CG13559,CG10764,CG15211, andGf.\n\n(B E) Differentially expressed Toll pathway components: core components (B), pathogen recognition receptors (C), antimicrobial peptides (D), and other targets (E). Only significantly affected DEGs (adjusted p<0.05 and |log2FC|>1, in one or more comparisons) are shown. See alsoFiguresS1andS2.\n\nWhereas many immune genes are constitutively active inhopTum lflies, remarkably, spaceflight activated the expression of a majority of these immune genes iny wflies (Figures5B 5E). The JAK STAT pathway ligands (upd2andupd3), several core components (SOCS36E), and target genes (TotA,Gf,mfas, andCG15211) were activated in S0y wversus G0y wflies (Figure5A). A clear signature for Toll/Imd pathway activation was also observed in S0y wadults. Elevated expression of pathway components (CG8046,Toll 9,Figure5B), pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs,PGRPs SA,SB1,SD,Figure5C), several antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes (Figure5D), and other Toll/Imd pathway target genes (Figure5E) was observed in S0y wversus G0y wflies. Notably, some Toll/Imd pathway target genes (e.g.,Drsl2,3,5) were also activated in S0hopTum lversus G0hopTum lflies (Figure5D).\n\nTo examine if the immune gene expression changes identified in space animals might have influenced tumor development in S0hopTum ladults (Figure6A), we scored tumor number and size (small, medium, large tumors, T score; seeSTAR methodsandFigures6B and 6C). In 25 30 adults from three independent G0 and S0 cultures, the average weighted T score was 1.07+/  0.22 in G0 adults and 2.94+/  0.40 in S0 flies (Figure6D), although this difference is lost in the adult G1 and S1 progeny of these G0/S0 animals (Figure6E). Tumors were not detected in S0y wanimals, even though they showed evidence of high immune signaling.\n\nTumor burden in naive G0/S0hopTum lfly adults\n\n(A) Experimental design for space and groundhopTum lflies for post flight experiments. The progeny of 300 females and 150 adult males were raised either in the ISS or at KSC (seeSTAR methods) at 22 degreesC, and then at 25 degreesC, once returned to the laboratory. Tumors were scored in larval and adult samples.\n\n(B and C) Representative G1hopTum ladult female (B)and male (C), showing tumor size classes: small, medium, and large.\n\n(D and E) Weighted average number of tumors per animal (tumor burden) in adult fly samples retrieved from ground (G0) and space (S0) (D)and values from their ground (G1) and space (S1) adult progeny (E). The weighted tumor numbers per animal in G0 and S0 adults were 1.07+/  0.22 and 2.94+/  0.40, respectively (mean+/  standard error; p= 0.015, Student'sttest;  indicates p<0.05). The weighted average tumor numbers per animal in G1 and S1hopTum ladult males were 5.09+/  0.08 and 5.07+/  0.33, respectively (mean+/  standard error; p= 0.95, Student'sttest). See alsoFiguresS1andS2.\n\nAs in the mutanthopTum ladults, high gene expression levels of the JAK STAT and Toll/Imd pathway genes encoding ligands, cytoplasmic mediators, and targets were recorded in naive G1 and S1hopTum llarvae when compared to G1y wand S1y wlarvae, respectively (FiguresS3A S3E). Thus, inhopTum llarvae, the immune effects of spaceflight are evaluated in the background of constitutive immune signaling.\n\nWe assessed if naive S1y worhopTum llarvae showed any lingering effects of space observed in their S0 parents. Spaceflight responsive differentially expressed immune genes in naive S1y wlarvae includedCG10764,LUBEL,PGRP SB1,  SC1a,  SC1b, and AMP genes,CecB,AttC,Drs, andDrsl5(FiguresS3A S3D). Similarly, naive S1hopTum llarvae showed elevated expression of immune targetsDptA,DptB,CecA2,Drsl3,Drsl5, andCecA1relative to their G1 counterparts (FigureS3D). Thus, in both genetic backgrounds, immune signaling was elevated in S1 larvae, even though the affected target genes were different. Naive S1 versus G1hopTum llarvae maintained the difference in inflammatory tumor burden observed in their parents (0.08+/  0.03 and 0.21+/  0.06, respectively, p= 0.010;Figures7A and 7B), although the mitotic index in the underlying hematopoietic tissue was not significantly different (2.74+/  0.93% of G1 and 1.95+/  0.66% of S1 macrophages were phospho histone H3 positive; p= 0.53).\n\nCellular immunity in G1 and S1hopTum llarvae, post parasitization\n\n(A) Tumor (T)scores of uninfected (UI) and tumor and encapsulation (T+ E) scores of G0/S0Lb  or G0/S0Lh infected G1/S1hopTum llarvae. Value above each bar indicates the mean+/  standard error.\n\n(B) Summary of the statistical analysis of pairwise comparisons of T or T+ E scores (seeSTAR methods).Lb17wasp infection rows are shaded for clarity. pvalues<0.05 (Mann Whitney U test for unpaired samples) were considered significant (bold). See alsoFiguresS3 S7.\n\nPrevious studies withhopTum llarvae have shown thatLb17attack provokes stronger cellular immune reactions thanLh14does. WhileLb17attack elicits encapsulation of the wasp egg due to an overabundance of circulating hemocytes (not recruited into the melanized tumors),Lh14 infectedhopTum llarvae instead develop small melanized specks8(seeFigureS4for examples of immune reactions). To assess if naive S1 versus G1hopTum llarval hosts differ in their ability to mount an encapsulation response, we exposed them to G0/S0Lb17orLh14wasps and computed a composite tumor encapsulation (T+ E) score for these animals, which measures their self  and wasp egg induced encapsulation response. The experimental design consisted of scoring T+ E scores from all G/S and host/parasite combinations. The following findings emerged from our comparisons of naive versusLb17  orLh14 infectedhopTum lhosts.\n\nFirst, naive versus G0 or S0Lb infected G1 or S1hopTum lhosts showed a 17  to 52 fold increase in T+ E scores, and scores from three of the four combinations differed significantly (Figures7A and 7B). The T+ E score in naive versus G0/S0Lh infected G1 or S1hopTum lhosts in all four combinations similarly increased from 1.4  to 14 fold, and the increases were significantly different across all four comparisons (Figures7A and 7B). It is noteworthy that the canonical Toll pathway targetDrsis strongly upregulated in S1hopTum lhosts afterLb17infection, but its expression remains unchanged afterLh14infection (Drs,FiguresS3F and S3G). This trend is characteristic of these wasps' effects on wild type hosts8and suggests that the overall differences in wasp virulence were maintained in spaceflight.\n\nSecond, S1 compared to G1 hosts, infected by S0 (but not G0) wasps of both species (S0 Lb/Lh_S1hosts versus S0 Lb/Lh_G1hosts), were more competent at mounting an immune response (3.64+/  0.46 versus 2.11+/  0.72 [p= 0.0199] forLb17and 0.76+/  0.03 versus 0.11+/  0.04 [p= 5.55 e 10] forLh14;Figures7A and 7B). Thus, not only is the tumor score higher in naive S1 compared to G1hopTum llarvae but S1 hosts are also more immune reactive than G1 hosts.\n\nThird, on ground hosts, space wasps of both species differed from ground wasps in their ability to elicit encapsulation. T+ E scores in G1hopTum lhosts subjected to S0 or G0 parasites of the same species (S0Lb/Lh_G1 hosts versusG0Lb/Lh_G1 hosts) showed that, for both parasites, the T+ E values for S0 wasp infections were significantly lower than the corresponding values for G0 parasites (2.11+/  0.72 versus 4.10+/  0.65 forLb17[p= 0.0199] and 0.11+/  0.04 versus 1.13+/  0.33 [p= 0.000915] forLh14). The difference was not significant in space hosts (Figures7A and 7B). These results suggest that, while S1 larval progeny may be adapting to normal gravity and other terrestrial conditions, they retain altered immune physiology of their space parents, albeit transiently. S0 wasps largely maintain their inherent virulent strategies, although we could detect subtle differences in their abilities to affect host immunity relative to G0 wasps.\n\nUponLb17attack, hemocytes in wild type lymph gland lobes divide and differentiate into lamellocytes and disperse into the hemocoel to surround the wasp egg.44,45,46Hemocytes in thehopTum llymph gland actively divide and differentiate in the absence of infection.43Because of the high inflammation state of space animals, we examined differences in lymph gland lobes from third instar G0 and S0 animals. A normal lymph gland has multiple, paired lobes, consisting of hemocytes, positioned along the tubular dorsal vessel that continues into a pulsating heart, which directs the flow of the hemolymph and circulating hemocytes into the body cavity (FiguresS5A S5D). The anterior most lobes are the largest, with hemocytes at varying differentiation stages. The posterior lobes are smaller in size and harbor fewer differentiated cells than the anterior lobes. The margins of all lobes from naivey wground and space hosts were continuous with none to little dispersal. Like lobes from G0 naivey wanimals, lobes from S0 naivey wanimals did not exhibit any hemocyte loss or any other obvious morphological change (FiguresS5A S5H).\n\nIn contrast to naivey wanimals, all anterior lobes of naive G0 and S0hopTum llarvae were dispersed due to the effect of the mutation (FiguresS5I S5P). The mutation also results in some lobes detaching from the dorsal vessel, and many GFP positive lamellocytes were present in G0 and S0hopTum lsamples. Some tumors were observed as small aggregates or as free floating structures in the hemolymph made of macrophages and lamellocytes (FiguresS5J and S5N). No clear difference in the posterior lobes was detected due to spaceflight in either fly strain.\n\nG1 and S1y whost lymph glands were unresponsive afterLbparasitization (FiguresS6A S6F). In naive G1hopTum llymph glands, GFP expressing cells were absent (FiguresS6G and S6H), whereas in S1 hosts lamellocytes were clearly observed regardless of infection status (FiguresS6I S6P). In some samples, lamellocyte rich tumors were associated with the anterior and posterior lobes (e.g., S1 sample,FiguresS6K and S5L). In only one S1 host, the anterior lobes exhibited a strong anti wasp response (FigureS6O). Thus, even though the T+ E scores rise in response toLbinfection, this difference was not reflected in the lymph gland morphologies of the animals we examined.\n\nLh14infection results in the gradual loss of hemocytes in all lobes. This effect is attributed to the presence of EVs in the entire lymph gland.20EVs were present in hematopoietic progenitor cells and dorsal vessels of G0 and S0Lh infected G1 and S1y whosts, and this association was accompanied by the loss of hematopoietic progenitors (FiguresS7A S7F). Similarly, in G1 and S1hopTum lhosts, the progenitor population was reduced, and EVs were present in the lymph glands of hosts after S0Lhinfection. (G0Lhwasps were not available for this experiment.) Lymph glands from uninfected G1 or S1 hosts do not possess EVs (FiguresS7G S7N). Thus, spaceflight does not affect the entry or distribution ofLhEVs in the hemolymphatic system.\n\nThe venom fluid containing the EVs is injected into the host during oviposition. Due to their close association with and direct effects on target hemocytes,17,20our definition of virulence proteins in this study is restricted to those that make up the EVs. Since standard annotations of wasp transcripts are not available, a custom pipeline was developed to analyze gene expression changes against corresponding transcriptomes (FigureS8A). Overall, in adult male and female wasps, the effects of spaceflight were detected (FiguresS8B and S8C), although they were modest, and less than 1.5% of all transcripts identified showed significant change when compared to respective ground controls (293 and 310 transcripts, forLb17andLh14, respectively). A majority of the transcripts were downregulated in both wasps (Figures8A 8C;TablesS2andS3). Furthermore, the intensity of gene expression change was also mild. Of the downregulated DEGs (adjusted p<0.05), more than 80% showed log (2) FC between  1.00 and  2.00 (228/280 inLb17and 250/261 inLh14). The remaining downregulated DEGs showed log (2) FC between  2.00 and  9.18. Only 6 of all DEGs showed a log (2) FC>2 forLb17; this number was 16 forLh14. These DEGs do not appear to belong to a specific functional class, and many lack clear annotations.\n\nDifferential expression of EV genes\n\n(A and B) Enhanced volcano plots for DEGs inLb17(A)andLh14(B) S0 vs. G0 wasp samples. Numerical identifiers correspond to EV genes inTables1and2, with their corresponding accession numbers.\n\n(C) Number of transcripts from adult male and female wasps, showing fluctuation in space. The term \"all transcripts\" refers to the number of transcript sequences in theLb17(GAJA00000000) andLh14(GAJC00000000) transcriptomes that aligned with the corresponding RNA Seq reads.47The term \"all DE transcripts\" refers to the number of differentially expressed transcripts in spaceflight vs. ground control samples (TablesS2andS3). A majority of transcripts were downregulated. SeeSTAR methodsandFigureS8for more details.\n\n(D) Transcripts coding for EV proteins in the RNA Seq samples show that 312Lb17EV and 398Lh14EV transcripts were identified for each wasp. Of these, only 29Lb17and 5Lh14transcripts were differentially expressed in S0 vs. G0 samples. Their identities, fold change values, and conserved protein domains are shown inTables1and2. See alsoFiguresS8,S10, andS11.\n\nThe identities of the proteins constitutingL.boulardiEVs were recently published.14Our comparative analysis indicated thatLbEV proteins show an overall profile similar to theLhEV profile; both are enriched in mammalian EV proteins.15A majority (> 98%) of the EV transcripts were identified in our RNA Seq analysis (312/316 forLb17and 398/406 forLh14). InLb17, 29/312 (9.89%) EV genes were significantly differentially expressed (Figure8D). Of these, 28 were downregulated (Table1). Two mildly downregulated genes are predicted to encode RhoGAP superfamily proteins (GAJA01018902.1, log (2) FC=  1.27, andGAJA01006288.1, log (2) FC=  1.09). A RhoGAP superfamily protein called LbGAP inLbEVs is implicated in wasp virulence.48,49Of the two downregulated wasp RhoGAP superfamily proteins, only one (GAJA01018902.1) showed homology to LbGAP: 69.7% nucleotide sequence identity (68% query coverage; 8e 55). ForLh14, only 5/398 (1.61%) transcripts were significantly differentially expressed. Of these, only one gene, lacking annotation, was about 5 fold upregulated (Table2). Of the downregulated genes, three lack annotations, and one is predicted to encode a protein with a chitin binding domain.\n\nLb17EV transcripts whose expression is significantly altered (adjusted p<0.05 and |log2FC|>1) in S0 wasps compared to G0 wasps\n\nConserved domains and motifs were detected via the Conserved Domain Database.50GenBank accession numbers and E values of the domain or protein family are shown.

The master record for theLh14TSA sequence database is GenBank:GAJC00000000.\n\nSpaceflight did not significantly affect the overall development of wasps. The yields per vial of each wasp species reared in space were comparable to those of ground control samples (Figure2E). The relative success of parasite versus host in individual vials suggested that eachLeptopilinaspecies successfully disarmed bothy wandhopTum lhosts in space and also on Earth (Figures2D and 2E). However, while nohopTum lhosts escaped parasitization byLborLhin either ground or space cultures, somey wflies emerged in the co culture vials (Figure2D), likely because these hosts overcame parasite infection or remained uninfected by the available parasites. When total wasps were scored relative to all insects (% wasps/total insects in each vial;FigureS9A), we found no significant difference in space  versus ground reared wasp samples. Both wasp species raised on either fly host showed equal success in flight and ground conditions (FigureS9B), reinforcing this conclusion.\n\nWe next investigated whether the morphology of EV particles produced by both wasp species is affected by spaceflight. In the scanning electron micrographs of gold coated samples of G0 and S0Lb17wasp venom, we observed no gross morphological difference (FiguresS10A S10G). The overall shapes and morphologies reported previously9,16were maintained in both samples. In addition to the regularly shaped, spiked particles, there were many particles with heterogeneous shapes, although most had spike like processes. We observed small membranous protrusions on the particles from both G0 and S0 EV samples that were previously not reported. The G0 and S0Lh14EV morphologies were also indistinguishable (and similar to previously reported structures9), in scanning electron micrographs of gold coated samples (FiguresS10H S10S). Overall, theLh14particle morphologies were uniform, and the particles were spiked, with variable spike length.\n\nAnexvivoassay was used to detect changes in G0 versus S0L.heterotomavirulence. Lamellocytes from laboratory rearedhopTum llarvae were exposed to venom fluid from G0 or S0 wasps. Venom from both wasp types promoted changes in lamellocyte shape compared to the buffer control (6.50%+/  0.76% G0; 6.12%+/  0.71% S0; 2.99%+/  0.06% buffer control), but there was no significant difference in the S0 versus G0Lh14venom activity (FiguresS11A S11C). These results are consistent with the unremarkable difference in the overallL.heterotomasuccess (emergence) of S0 versus G0Lh14wasps.\n\nSpace radiation induced mutations inD.melanogasterhave previously been reported.51,52We hypothesized that parasitoid wasps are similarly sensitive to high levels of radiation in the ISS. We therefore examined the grandsons of space returned males (Figure9A). While no heritable defects were observed for anyLb17or ground raisedLh14, we obtained two recessive mutations inLh14(Figures9B 9G). In theaurum1mutant, melanization of the wings is affected, making the normal wings appear golden (horizontal arrows;Figures9B,9C,9E, and9F; side by side view in panel G). This mutant is homozygous viable, and a pure breeding stock could be established (seeSTAR methods). A second phenotypic alteration was identified in this pure breedingaurum1stock, where the posterior wing margin in affected individuals is angular as opposed to the wild type round shape (vertical arrows;Figures9D 9F). In rare cases, thiskona1mutation was incompletely penetrant, where only one wing was affected (Figure9F). To our knowledge, these are the only live mutant animals in this class of wasps.\n\nMutant strains ofL heterotoma\n\n(A) Steps employed for the isolation of mutant wasps.\n\n(B F) Phenotypes of mutant wasps (C F), identified from space samples compared to wild type (B)Lhwasps. Males of wild type,aurum1(pigmentation of the wing blade and of wing veins affected), andkona1(wing shape affected) wasps are shown. Horizontal arrows point to differences in melanization in wild type versusaurum1mutants. The color difference is subtle but consistent. Vertical arrows point to the angular wing shape of thekona1mutant as compared to the rounded wild type wing blade. Double mutants in panels (E)and (F)possess both mutant traits. The shape of the left wing in panel (F)is wild type in appearance, while the right one (arrow) is angular. Samples in panels B F were photographed at the same time.\n\n(G) A side by side comparison of wild type (left) andaurum1(right) wings shows a clear difference in the melanization of wing veins.\n\n(H) Theaurumandkonaloci appear to be unlinked, as F2 males from unmated heterozygous females were scored in roughly equal proportions.\n\n(I) Homozygouskona1females are unable to oviposit based on observations of more than 30 hosts dissected. (The number of hosts scored is indicated in parentheses).\n\n(J) Representative ovipositors from wild type and mutant wasps. Homozygouskona1females with defective ovipositors show areas of compromised integrity or have branched ends (arrows) compared to the continuous ovipositors with sharp ends from wild type control wasps (+/+). Posterior is to the top. Scale bar= 300um. See alsoFigureS12.\n\nTo assess ifaurumandkonagenes are unlinked, we scored over 1,000 sons of unmated double mutant heterozygous females. Roughly equal numbers of parental and recombinant classes were observed (chi squared test, p= 0.63;Figure9H). Even though thekona1strain was homozygous viable, we were unable to make a pure breeding stock. Moreover, we did not find wasp eggs in dissected hosts, regardless of whether the infectingkona1/kona1females were unmated or mated. This result suggested that homozygouskona1females were unable to oviposit while their heterozygous counterparts were successful (Figure9I). The ovipositors ofkona1homozygotes showed structural defects, including branched termini instead of the sharp, needle like ends of the wild typeLhovipositor (Figure9J). Abdominal dissection ofkona1/kona1females revealed ovaries and eggs that are morphologically indistinguishable from wild type or heterozygous females (FigureS12). Thus, it appears that oogenesis is likely unaffected inkona1mutants, and they are sterile due to their inability to oviposit.",
    "discussion": "American scientists first launched fruit flies into space in 1947, and since then more than 20 spaceflight experiments with fruit flies have been conducted.4Even parasitic wasps have been to space: in 1967, Biosatellite II carriedHabrobracon juglandisinto space.53H.juglandisis a small ectoparasite that attacks moths. The Biosatellite II mission reported multiple effects of spaceflight alone, or that of radiation in conjunction with spaceflight, onD.melanogasterandH.juglandis.53,54D.melanogaster, however, continues to be an obvious choice for space travel studies for all the advantages the model organism offers researchers on Earth. Among the most cost effective model systems, its high fecundity and small size facilitate the study of large numbers of individual flies, which is necessary for statistically relevant experimental protocols. These previous \"fruit flies in space\" studies have tackled a variety of questions, including development, aging, mating, cardiac, and neural functions, that have implications for astronaut health.4,55Despite suffering from cardiac and neurological deficits,33,56Drosophilaborn in space can largely survive the dual challenges of short term exposure to microgravity and radiation.\n\nSpaceflight conditions exerted unexpected and differential effects on our experimentalDrosophilastrains. While thehopTum lflies with CI survived just as well in space as on the ground, they wstrain, free of tumors and CI, was surprisingly more vulnerable to the spaceflight stressors, and fewery wflies emerged from the flight compared to ground cultures. Molecular analysis revealed a complex interplay between genetic and environmental conditions. Three trend lines are noteworthy, which are discussed in the following. First, specific expression profiles of Top DEGs attributed to genetic differences were maintained in space, suggesting that the gene regulatory circuits underlying these differences may be sufficiently robust and may therefore remain refractory to spaceflight.\n\nSecond, the Top DEGs include genes encoding structural proteins for the cuticle and the chorion, an observation that was also reported in a previous multigenerational study on wild type flies.55Some of the cuticle related DEGs were upregulated in one of the two S0 genetic strains, but not in the other S0 strain, while other DEGs were downregulated in S0 flies of both genetic backgrounds. This result suggests that transcriptional co regulation of promoters among Top DEG family members may be adaptive to either or both genetic and environmental variables. Chitin and its associated proteins are part of the fly's exoskeletal matrisome, and together they support the cells they surround structurally and functionally.57,58A highly coordinated chitin synthesis and degradation program underlies insect growth. It would be interesting to assess if the cuticle or the chorion of S0 flies differs from that of G0 flies.\n\nThird, numerous essential genes were downregulated in space iny w, but not inhopTum lanimals, suggesting that the cumulative effect of their reduced transcription may have led to their reduced viability. Thus, while increased tumor burden and alterations in gene expression in S0hopTum ladults did not compromise their overall survival,y wflies exhibited increased immune gene expression, remained tumor free in space, and exhibited reduced survival. Future experiments will help clarify the differential effects of space on the expression of essential genes in these genetic strains. Many of these essential fly genes are conserved, and their human orthologs are linked to disease conditions. These results not only defied our expectation that animals with chronic disease would be more vulnerable to spaceflight but also suggested that, if extrapolated to other animals, spaceflight's effects on individuals of distinct genetic backgrounds may not necessarily be straightforward to predict.\n\nOur previous molecular genetic analysis ofhopTum llarvae showed that hyperactive Toll signaling in larval lamellocytes contributes to CI phenotypes.24A plethora of target genes of both the JAK STAT and Toll pathways is constitutively active inhopTum lmutants. Strikingly,many of the same pathway components and target genes that are constitutively active inhopTum lmutants are also upregulated in S0y wflies, even though the S0y wflies remained tumor free. A few AMP genes (e.g.,Drs,Drsl,CecA, etc.) are further upregulated in S0hopTum lflies, suggesting that the increased tumor burden in S0hopTum ladults is fueled by ectopic JAK STAT and Toll signaling induced in space.\n\nUnlike their parents, however, naive S1y wlarvae did not exhibit a clear and strong inflammatory gene expression readout (see S0/G0y wcolumn inFigure5D and S1/G1y wcolumn inFigureS3D, where constitutive immune signaling does not mask the effects of space). In contrast, like their parents, many immune genes in naive G1/S1 larvae were active inhopTum llarvae. Even though changes in mitotic indices of host hemocytes or their lymph gland morphologies were not detected in these S1 versus G1hopTum llarvae, a significantly enhanced T score was observed in naive S1 versus G1hopTum llarvae. This increased immune reactivity was also reflected in the enhanced T+ E scores in infected S1hopTum llarvae, relative to their G1 counterparts. The increased tumor burden detected in naive S1hopTum llarvae did not persist in S1hopTum ladults. Collectively, these observations suggest that, with re adaptation to normal gravity, the inflammatory effects of spaceflight are transient and reversible. The highly inflamed state ofhopTum lanimals provided physiological insights into the modest changes in wasp virulence due to spaceflight.\n\nWe hypothesized that stress from spaceflight could compromise the development of either of the two partners: the fly or the parasite. Because of the complete dependence of the parasite on the host, either situation would be detrimental to parasite development. In an alternative scenario, if the effects of spaceflight on fly hosts are modest, then endoparasite development should not be affected. Wasps of both species developed successfully in the ISS environment; the more virulentLh14species was equally successful in both conditions, whileLb17survival was marginally compromised in space. This difference inLb17versusLh14success may have to do with their dissimilar virulence strategies, withLb17being less successful onD.melanogasterthanLh14.8Global gene expression changes in space raised parasites were remarkably mild, and less than 1.5% of the adult parasite transcripts were affected. Consistent with parasite emergence results, the transcription of many more genes was affected in S0Lb17than in S0Lh14. Thus, even though radiation in space led to germline mutations in one of the two parasites, the overall detrimental effects of microgravity were not sufficiently strong to block parasite development. We speculate that the notable overall success of both parasites in space may be due to their endoparasitoid life histories: developing internally, the preimaginal stages remain protected from the environmental challenges in space. Parasites have varied life histories and distinct survival strategies in the context of host physiology. With increased travel to space, it is inevitable that parasites will unintentionally hitch a ride with their hosts. With plans for the colonization of other planets, multigenerational experiments on \"short life cycle\" organisms such asD.melanogasterand their associated flora and fauna will become important. Innovative and sophisticated hardware designed for multigenerational studies will be helpful in this regard.\n\nThe virulence properties of both parasites also appeared to be largely maintained in space. This conclusion is based on (a)comparable yields of parasites in space versus ground cultures, (b)relatively stronger effects ofLb17on the T+ E score compared toLh14, and (c)stronger transcriptional activation ofDrosomycin(Drs) in S1 hosts afterLb17infection but not afterLh14infection (FiguresS3F and S3G). It is intriguing that S0 wasps of both species were less effective at increasing the T+ E score in both G1 and S1hopTum lhosts. This result suggests that the space environment did affect wasp physiology or virulence; the latter interpretation being consistent with reported increases in microbial virulence in space.31,32\n\nA clear molecular explanation for differences in S0 versus G0 wasps was not apparent from the molecular analysis of wasp EV gene transcription. Transcript levels of only 29/312Lb17EV genes were significantly affected with all but one gene being downregulated. Only one of the two predicted RhoGAP superfamily genes shares structural similarity with the known LbGAP virulence protein,49and even its expression was weakly downregulated in space. The transcription of only 5/398Lh14EV transcripts was differentially affected, with only one gene (lacking annotation) showing  5 fold upregulation. None of these genes is currently implicated inLh14virulence. Furthermore, in anexvivoassay,Lh14venom from S0 wasps was no different in its ability to distort lamellocytes thanLh14venom from G0 wasps. The abundance and distribution of G0 and S0Lh14EVs in the dorsal vessel and lymph gland lobes of infected animals further suggest that the integrity of S0Lh14EV is comparable to that of controls. It is possible that the cumulative effects of differential gene expression changes contributed to differences between S0 and G0 wasps. Alternatively, S0 wasps may differ in their oviposition behavior, affecting the quantity of venom introduced into the host.\n\nHaplodiploidy in Hymenoptera makes it convenient to conduct mutational studies in space, as haploid sons (developing from unfertilized eggs of mutated females) would exhibit dominant or recessive mutant phenotypes. In our study, male wasps were used to evaluate the effects of radiation on their germline, while female wasps were used in virulence assays. Screening grandsons of S0Lh14males developed in space resulted in the isolation of two visible mutants, one of which is homozygous viable, while the other is homozygous female sterile. Dosimetry measurements on SpaceX 14 recorded an average absorbed dose rate of 0.3 mGy/day, or 9.6 mGy for the 32 day duration in the ISS. Being in low Earth orbit, the ISS is protected by the Earth's magnetosphere.59Yet, chronic exposure to these radiation levels likely resulted in DNA damage in the germline of the parasites reared in space. Despite efforts to shield the space station from the damaging consequences of radiation,60our results support previous studies showing that animals in the ISS are at risk for DNA damage and physiological dysfunction.1Given the success of this mission, systematic studies designed to compare the effects of radiation onDrosophilaandLeptopilinamay be particularly insightful, as both species yield high numbers of progeny and mutant phenotypes can be scored in the F1 generation. The risks of radiation increase considerably with the planned manned lunar missions and other deep space missions for long term colonization.1,61Future model organism studies can help assess the hazardous effects of radiation on soma versus germline genomes and inspire ways to avert these risks with innovative shielding designs. The isolation of mutant wasp lines will advance our understanding of wasp genomics, genetics, and host parasite biology. The space environment is likely to have as yet unknown impacts on animal immune function; refining our understanding of host parasite systems with new genetic tools on Earth will broaden our understanding of immune function in space. Studies of other animal and plant hosts and their natural parasites in modeled microgravity and/or radiation will provide insights into their effects on host defense and parasite virulence.\n\nSpaceflight experiments with live organisms are constrained by the weather, the logistics of the launch and retrieval protocols, the duration of the mission, the physical conditions within the ISS module, and available crew time. This study faced all these constraints. Although the 34 day mission duration aligned well with the overall goals of our experiment, by the end of the mission, the number of G0/S0 larvae was insufficient to set up infections with G0/S0 wasps. (Available G0/S0 larvae were dissected to examine lymph gland hemocyte morphologies [FigureS5].) It is quite likely that the effects of infection on the T+ E values in G0/S0 hosts (infected with G0/S0 wasps) would be stronger than what we observed in G1/S1 hosts. The availability of fresh fly media for culturing naive G0/S0 adult flies, born in space or on ground, would have ensured sufficient numbers of larval hosts for these infection experiments, a strong consideration for designing future experiments.",
