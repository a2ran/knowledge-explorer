    "abstract": "The heart and its cellular components are profoundly altered by missions to space and injury on Earth. Further research, however, is needed to characterize and address the molecular substrates of such changes. For this reason, neonatal and adult human cardiovascular progenitor cells (CPCs) were cultured aboard the International Space Station. Upon return to Earth, we measured changes in the expression of microRNAs and of genes related to mechanotransduction, cardiogenesis, cell cycling, DNA repair, and paracrine signaling. We additionally assessed endothelial like tube formation, cell cycling, and migratory capacity of CPCs. Changes in microRNA expression were predicted to target extracellular matrix interactions and Hippo signaling in both neonatal and adult CPCs. Genes related to mechanotransduction (YAP1, RHOA) were downregulated, while the expression of cytoskeletal genes (VIM,NES,DES,LMNB2,LMNA), non canonical Wnt ligands (WNT5A,WNT9A), and Wnt/calcium signaling molecules (PLCG1,PRKCA) was significantly elevated in neonatal CPCs. Increased mesendodermal gene expression along with decreased expression of mesodermal derivative markers (TNNT2,VWF, andRUNX2), reduced readiness to form endothelial like tubes, and elevated expression of Bmp and Tbx genes, were observed in neonatal CPCs. Both neonatal and adult CPCs exhibited increased expression of DNA repair genes and paracrine factors, which was supported by enhanced migration. While spaceflight affects cytoskeletal organization and migration in neonatal and adult CPCs, only neonatal CPCs experienced increased expression of early developmental markers and an enhanced proliferative potential. Efforts to recapitulate the effects of spaceflight on Earth by regulating processes described herein may be a promising avenue for cardiac repair.",
    "methods": "CPCs were isolated from cardiac tissue of neonatal (1day 1 month) or adult (57 72 year old) human patients, as previously described.27The methods were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations and were approved by the Institutional Review Board of Loma Linda University for the use of discarded tissue without identifiable private information under a waiver of informed consent. Thus, informed consent was not required since the discarded tissue was not collected specifically for this study, and the tissue was obtained with no identifiable patient specific information. Briefly, atrial tissue was cut into small clumps (approximately 1.0mm3) then enzymatically digested using collagenase (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) at a working concentration of 1mg/mL. The resulting solution was then passed through a 40 um cell strainer. Cells were cloned in a 96 well plate by limiting dilution to a final concentration of 0.8 cells per well to create populations for expansion. Cells were then screened for the co expression of Isl1 and c Kit. Clonal CPC cultures were selected for other markers of early cardiac development (KDR and PDGFRA) and then supplemented with growth media comprised of 10% fetal bovine serum (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA), 100ug/mL penicillin streptomycin (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), 1% minimum essential medium non essential amino acids solution (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), and 22% endothelial cell growth media (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) in Medium 199 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Mycoplasma contamination was tested using the MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) following the manufacturer's protocol.\n\nProgenitor cell populations were fluorescently labeled with antibodies, as recommended by their respective manufacturers. Briefly, for developmental marker detection, CPCs were incubated with Viobility 405/520 before being washed in 1xPBS (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) containing 0.5% BSA (Research Products International Corp, Mt. Prospect, IL) and 2mM EDTA (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Then, CPCs were stained for cardiac related stem cell surface markers (PDGFRalpha, CXCR4, c Kit, and SSEA1). CPCs were then fixed in 4% PFA (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), permeabilized in 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), blocked in 0.6M glycine (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) solution containing 10% BSA (Research Products International Corp, Mt. Prospect, IL), and stained for intracellular, cardiac related stem cell surface markers (Isl1 and Mesp1). For directed differentiation assays, cells were stained for TropT after being fixed in 4% PFA (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), permeabilized in 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) or directly for vWF or SMA. Stained CPCs were then analyzed using a MACSQuant analyzer (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA). Quantification of data was performed using FlowJo software version 10 (Ashland, OR). Compensation was performed using UltraComp eBeads (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, one drop of compensation beads were incubated with each antibody individually for 30min at 4 degreesC and then detected using the same MACSQuant analyzer just prior to experiments requiring compensation. FlowJo was then used to generate a compensation matrix, which was applied to all experimental data. Information concerning antibodies, isotype controls, and reagents used in antibody labeling is provided in TableS2.\n\nTo validate the ability of neonatal and adult CPCs to differentiate into cells of the cardiovascular lineage, directed differentiation assays were performed, as described in Le et al.40and Smits et al.41In brief, to generate cardiomyocytes, CPCs were cultured in growth media (see above) until 85% confluent. CPC growth media was then replaced with differentiation media (47% IMDM, 47% Ham's F12 with GlutaMAX, 2% penicillin streptomycin, 2% horse serum, 1% minimum essential medium non essential amino acids solution, and 1% insulin transferring selenium (all reagents from Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) containing 5uM 5 Azacytidine (Sigma, St. Louis, MO)), which was refreshed daily for 3days. Then, 1ng/mL TGF beta (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and 0.1mM ascorbic acid (Acros Organics, Geel, Belgium) in fresh differentiation media was added routinely until day 14, at which time cells were stained for TropT or placed in TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) for gene expression analysis. To generate endothelium, CPCs were cultured in growth media (see above) until 85% confluent, at which time the growth media was replaced with endothelial cell growth media (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) containing 25ng/mL Bmp4 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and 50ng/mL Vegf (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for 2days. The media was then replaced with endothelial cell growth media (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) containing 50ng/mL Vegf and cultured for 4days. Then, cells were regularly fed endothelial cell growth media (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) until day 14, at which time cells were stained for vWF, placed in TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) for gene expression analysis, or seeded onto Matrigel for endothelial like tube formation assay analysis, as described below. Finally, to generate smooth muscle cells, CPCs were cultured in growth media (see above) until 85% confluent, at which time the growth media was replaced with DMEM (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) containing 4.5g/Ld glucose, 2% fetal bovine serum (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA), and 50ng/mL PDGF BB (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). This media was regularly replaced until day 14, at which time cells were stained for smooth muscle actin or placed in TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) for gene expression analysis.\n\nNeonatal and adult CPCs were seeded into Biocells (BioServe Space Technologies, Boulder, CO) at two seeding densities (7500 cells or 5000 cells) and loaded into self contained environments containing 5% CO2and 95% air. The seeding conditions were carefully titrated on Earth to identify the most optimal conditions under which CPCs could be cultured over the course of the experiment. These conditions were then tested during an Experiment Verification Test, which was performed with BioServe Space Technologies ahead of the mission launch. They were then flown aboard SpaceX CRS 11 to the US National Lab on the ISS where they were placed in an incubator containing 5% CO2and 95% air. Fresh media was provided every 4 to 5days while aboard the ISS (FigS3). At 12 days, the Biocells that were seeded with 7500 cells were flooded with RNAProtect (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and stored at  80 degreesC. At 30 days, the Biocells seeded with 5000 cells were fed and returned to Earth. Clone matched and passage matched ground controls were fed and treated in parallel with the feeding schedule and activities performed by astronauts aboard the ISS.\n\nUpon landing and retrieval of the payload, live cells were trypsinized, counted, and used to assess cell cycle, migration, and endothelial like tube formation, as well as to prepare protein lysates. Biocells containing cells fixed and frozen in RNAprotect were thawed at room temperature. The RNAprotect was removed and centrifuged at 10,000xgat 4 degreesC for 10min. Biocells were disassembled and the culture membranes were then rinsed with TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). RNA was purified from the RNAprotect samples using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), per the manufacturer's instructions, while total RNA was purified from TRIzol reagent using isopropanol based and ethanol based precipitation. cDNA was generated and RT PCR was performed as described below.\n\nMicroRNA array profiling was performed as previously described.1Briefly, the miScript II RT Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) was used to convert 500ng of total RNA into cDNA, which was diluted, added to miScript SYBR Green PCR master mix and 10x universal primer mix (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and run on human development and differentiation miScript plates (MIHS 103ZA; Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Fold changes were determined for each clone using the Qiagen Data Analysis Center (http://www.qiagen.com/us/shop/genes and pathways/data analysis center overview page/) using all available housekeeping genes. Since this analysis center performs only a two tailed Student'st test to calculateP values, all fold changes for individual clones were exported to Prism and analyzed, as described below. Individual primers for SNORD96a, SNORD72, hsa miR 100 5p, and hsa miR 99a 5p (SABiosciences, Valencia CA) were also used (TableS2). The averageCtvalue of SNORD96a and SNORD72 was used as a housekeeping control. The PCR conditions for the microRNA arrays and individual microRNA assays were: 95 degreesC for 15min and 40 cycles of 94 degreesC for 15s, 55 degreesC for 60s, and 70 degreesC for 30s. Differences in fold changes between ground cultured and ISS cultured CPCs were then analyzed as described in the statistics sub section.\n\nKEGG analysis was performed using DIANA mirPath version 3 and TarBase v7.042for microRNAs that were found to be significantly altered in neonatal and adult CPCs. Results were merged by pathway union after controlling for error rate due to multiple comparisons via selecting the \"correct for FDR\" feature. After removing categories related to cancer, neurological diseases, and viruses/pathogenesis, the KEGG categories whoseP values were <0.05 were reported.\n\nWe used custom array plates (CLAH22469A; Qiagen, Valencia, CA) per the manufacturer's instructions to measure gene expression changes in ISS cultured adult and neonatal CPCs that were relevant to Wnt, ERK, BMP/Smad, and Notch signaling; cytoskeletal maintenance; calcium handling; apoptosis and cell cycle; cardiac development and stemness; and regeneration. Briefly, 2ug of RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA, as described above, and then thoroughly mixed with 2xRT2SYBR Green Mastermix and RNase free and DNase free water before being loaded into the profiler array plate. Samples were amplified in the iCycler iQ5 PCR Thermal Cycler (Bio Rad, Hercules, CA) using a protocol of 95 degreesC for 10min and 40 cycles of 95 degreesC for 15s and 60 degreesC for 1min. Fold changes were determined for each clone individually using the Qiagen Data Analysis Center (http://www.qiagen.com/us/shop/genes and pathways/data analysis center overview page/) usingGAPDHandACTB(beta actin) as housekeeping genes. Since this analysis center performs only a two tailed Student'st test to calculateP values, all fold changes for individual clones were exported to Prism and analyzed, as described below.\n\nChanges in the expression of select genes were analyzed using RT PCR. RNA was isolated from CPCs as described above. cDNA was prepared using 2ug of RNA with Superscript III (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT PCR) was performed using Go Taq qPCR Mastermix (Promega, Madison, WI) and the iCycler iQ5 PCR Thermal Cycler (Bio Rad, Hercules, CA) following a protocol of 94 degreesC for 10min and 45 cycles of 94 degreesC for 15s, 46 68 degreesC (depending on the primer) for 60s, and 72 degreesC for 30s. RT PCR products were visualized using 1% 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and low mass DNA ladder (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Primers were designed using the National Center for Biotechnology Information Primer BLAST program and obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Primers used in experiments are listed in TableS2.\n\nMatrigel (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD) was added to a 96 well plate (50uL/well) and hardened in a humidified, 5% CO2incubator at 37 degreesC for 1h. Cells (20,000 per well) were then incubated for seven hours in EGM 2 media (Lonza Allendale, NJ) before being stained with Calcein AM (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburg, PA) for 30min. Their ability to form capillary like networks was measured using an EVOS imaging system (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA) and quantified with ImageJ (v1.47f, NIH, Bethesda, MD).\n\nAliquots of 250,000 cells were fixed with 70% ethanol overnight, incubated for 60min with RNAse A (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburg, PA), and stained with propidium iodide, prior to running samples on a MACSquant analyzer (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA) and analyzing cell cycle progression using the Dean Jett Fox model in the cell cycle analysis tool of FlowJo software (Ashland, OR).\n\nCPCs were trypsinized, counted, and resuspended in starving medium that contained IMDM with GlutaMAX (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), 1% Insulin Transferrin Selenium (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), and 0.5% FBS (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). 50,000 CPCs were plated in the top chamber of a 96 well transwell migration assay (Corning, Union City, CA) with 8um pores. Standard CPC growth medium supplemented with 100ng/mL of SDF 1alpha (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) was used in the bottom chamber as a chemoattractant. After 6h, migrated cells in the bottom chamber were stained using Calcein AM (Fisher Scientific Pittsburg, PA) and quantified using a FLX800 fluorescent plate reader (Bio Tek, Winooski, VT).\n\nThe Shapiro Wilk test for normality was used to test the normality of data distribution. We then performed a two tailed, pairedt test to compare the mean of all normally distributed data. Non normally distributed data were compared using a Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank text. For cell cycle, migration, and endothelial like tube formation assay, samples in each group were pooled and either a two tailed, unpairedt test or Mann WhitneyUtest was used to compare the mean of normally or non normally distributed data, respectively. All data are reported as the mean+/ the standard error of the mean. Prism 7 version 7.02 (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA) was used for all statistical analyses.P values<0.05 were assumed to indicate statistical significance.\n\nGene and microRNA expression data used in RT PCR, custom array, and microarray experiments have been deposited in NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus and is accessible through GEO series accession numberGSE110563.43Additional data relating to this publication are available upon request to the corresponding author.",
    "results": "CPCs were clonally isolated, expanded, screened for the co expression of Isl1 and c Kit, assessed for viability, and ultimately selected for experiments based upon the expression of early developmental markers (Mesp1, PDGFRalpha, and SSEA1) along with the chemokine receptor CXCR4. Representative adult and neonatal clones are shown in Fig.1aand FigS1. Neonatal and adult CPCs are able to differentiate into cardiomyocytes (Fig.1b), endothelial cells (Fig.1c), and smooth muscle cells (Fig.1d) when cultured using directed differentiation protocols (Fig.S2). Clonal lines of CPCs obtained from neonatal and adult patients were then flown aboard the ISS for 12 days and fixed in RNAprotect during orbit (Fig.S3).\n\nSpaceflight alters microRNA expression in neonatal and adult early CPCs. Neonatal (blue) and adult (red) CPC clones were screened for the co expression of Isl1 and c Kit, assessed for viability, and then ultimately selected for experiments based upon the co expression of early developmental markers (Mesp1, PDGFRalpha, KDR, and SSEA1) along with the chemokine receptor CXCR4a. Directed differentiation of these CPCs is able to induce cardiomyocytesb, endothelial cellsc, and smooth muscle cellsd. Neonatal and adult CPCs both exhibited significant alterations in microRNA expression following 12 days of culture aboard the ISSe. KEGG analysis (TableS1) indicated likely targeting of ECM interactions, membrane metabolism, and Hippo signaling by these microRNAs.n=3 unique clones per age per group for all miRs, except miR 99a and miR100, which were measured in biological and technical triplicates. Data are reported as the mean+/ SEM, *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001\n\nIn an effort to understand the relevant signaling events by which CPCs adapt to culture aboard the ISS, we performed microarray analysis to measure broad alterations to transcriptional control. Among both neonatal and adult CPCs, 14 microRNAs exhibited significant alterations in levels of expression (Fig.1e). KEGG analysis by age group (TableS1) indicated that fatty acid biosynthesis, extracellular matrix (ECM) receptor interactions, and Hippo signaling were the most significantly affected targets of these microRNAs.\n\nSince the pathways targeted by the significantly dysregulated microRNAs affect cytoskeletal remodeling and mechanotransduction pathways (Fig.2a), we sought to measure changes in the expression ofYAP1, a gene involved in Hippo signaling; small RhoGTPases; and cytoskeletal molecules.YAP1was significantly downregulated in neonatal CPCs (0.24 fold,P<0.01) and modestly upregulated in adult CPCs (2.6 fold,P<0.01) (Fig.2b). This prompted us to assess the mechanosensitive small RhoGTPases, which indicated that onlyRHOAwas significantly downregulated in neonatal CPCs (0.15 fold,P<0.05, Fig.2c), which led us to assess the possible effects of spaceflight on cytoskeletal dysregulation. In doing so, we found that the cytoskeletal genesVIM,NES,DES,LMNB2, andLMNAwere all significantly upregulated (5.2 , 22 , 6 , 5.1 , and 10 fold, respectively;P<0.05) following spaceflight (Fig.2e). Meanwhile, in adult CPCs, onlyNESexpression decreased significantly (0.30 fold,P<0.01) (Fig.2d, f).\n\nSpaceflight impacts expression of genes involved in mechanotransduction and cytoskeleton maintenance. Integrin and mechanical signaling impact Hippo activity and small RhoGTPases, which function along the Wnt planar cell polarity pathwaya.YAP1expression was significantly reduced in neonatal CPCs and upregulated in adult CPCsb.RHOA, a small RhoGTPase, was expressed at significantly lower levels in neonatalc, but not adultd, CPCs. Accordingly, cytoskeletal gene expression was significantly upregulated in neonatale, but not adultf, CPCs.n=3 biological replicates for all gene expression data, exceptYAP1(n=6 measures of three pooled clones). Data are reported as the mean+/ SEM, *P<0.05, **P<0.01\n\nGiven the role of small RhoGTPases in non canonical, planar cell polarity Wnt signaling and the impact of RhoA on regulating calcium signaling,13we sought to assess the expression of genes involved in the canonical and calcium Wnt pathways. (Fig.3a f). We observed significantly increased expression ofGSK3B(6.8 fold,P<0.05) in neonatal CPCs (Fig.3a) and significantly increased expression ofCTNNB1(1.9 fold,P<0.05) in adult CPCs (Fig.3d). Since Gsk3beta sequesters beta catenin for degradation in the cytoplasm, thereby suggesting suppression of canonical Wnt signaling in neonatal CPCs and the promotion of canonical Wnt signaling in adult CPCs, we measured non canonical Wnt ligand expression and that of genes in the Wnt/Ca2+pathway. We measured significantly increasedWNT5AandWNT9Aexpression (36 fold and 17 fold, respectively;P<0.05) in neonatal CPCs (Fig.3b) and significantly decreasedWNT9Aexpression (0.39 fold,P<0.05) in adult CPCs (Fig.3e). This was supported by significantly increased expression ofPLCG1andPRKCA(14 fold and 12 fold, respectively;P<0.05) and a general increase inITPR1expression in neonatal CPCs (Fig.3c), but not adult CPCs (Fig.3f).\n\nGenes involved in the non canonical Wnt/Ca2+pathway are expressed at higher levels along with mesendodermal markers in neonatal CPCs. Canonical Wnt signaling genes were measured in neonatalaand adultdCPCs along with non canonical Wnt ligandsb,e. Genes involved in the non canonical Wnt/calcium pathway were elevated in neonatalc, but not adultf, CPCs. Markers of development were measured in neonatal and adult CPCs, which indicated elevation of early mesodermal markers (i.e.,FOXC1,MESP1, andT) in the former and no changes in the latter populationg.n=3 unique clones per group. Data are reported as the mean+/ SEM, *P<0.05\n\nCalcium and Wnt signaling have central roles in cardiogenesis. For this reason, we sought to assess the transcription of markers of various stages of cardiac development. In doing so, we observed that the expression of genes involved in embryonic stem cell self renewal (POU5F1,NANOG,SOX2), mesodermal specification (FOXC1,MESP1,T), and early cardiogenesis (GATA4,KIT,PDGFRA,ISL1,KDR)increased, whileNKX2 5expression decreased, in neonatal CPCs (Fig.3g). In this population, the expression of genes involved in early mesodermal specification were the most significantly elevated. Conversely, adult CPCs generally exhibited decreased or unchanged expression of genes involved in early developmental processes (Fig.3g).\n\nThese modifications to the expression of genes involved in cardiogenesis motivated us to measure the changes in the expression of genes in the Bmp, Smad, and Tbx families, which have important roles in pre  and early mesodermal development. We measured elevated expression ofBMP4,TBX3,TBX5, andTBX18, and a general increase inBMP2expression in neonatal CPCs (Fig.4a). In adult CPCs,SMAD1exhibited a significant increase in expression, whileSMAD2andTBX18also trended towards an increase in expression (Fig.4a). These findings indicate that the transcripts of genes involved in early pre cardiac mesoderm development are upregulated by spaceflight in neonatal CPCs.\n\nSpaceflight reduces the propensity for neonatal CPCs to readily form endothelial like tubes and express markers of terminal mesodermal derivatives. The expression of members of the BMP, Smad, and TBX families of genes was measuredaand found to be elevated significantly in neonatal CPCs and modestly in adult CPCs. Following culture in biocells on the ground or the ISS for 30 days, CPCs were placed in endothelial growth media and incubated on Matrigel for 7h to facilitate endothelial like tube formation. The length of endothelial like tubes formedband the number of branchescwere quantified using ImageJ for neonatal grounddand ISSeCPCs as well as for adult groundfand ISSgCPCs (ruler=1000um). Changes in gene expression relevant to mesodermal derivatives were measured in CPCs cultured aboard the ISS for 12 days, indicating decreased expression of cardiomyocyte, endothelial, and osteogenic markers and increased expression of sinoatrial nodal markersh.n=3 unique clones per group for gene expression data;n=3 measurements of four pooled clones per group for migration assay data. Data are reported as the mean+/ SEM, ***P<0.001\n\nGiven the elevated expression of early to pre mesodermal genes in neonatal, but not adult, CPCs, we sought to measure whether spaceflight impacts the expression of CPC and other mesodermal derivative markers. First, following 30 days in orbit, CPCs were returned to Earth and assayed for endothelial like tube formation using a widely accepted assay to assess the potency of progenitor cells with the capacity to form tube like structures.14,15However, endothelial specific markers were not measured on space flown CPCs in this assay. Unlike adult CPCs, neonatal CPCs exhibited a significantly reduced ability to form endothelial like tubes (Fig.4b, c). Representative images of endothelial like tube formation of neonatal ground (Fig.4d) and ISS (Fig.4e) as well as adult ground (Fig.4f) and ISS (Fig.4g) samples reflect this age dependent response of CPCs to spaceflight. This impact of ISS culture on endothelial like tube formation ability led us to measure the expression of markers of other derivatives: cardiomyocyte (TNNT2), endothelial (VWF), and osteoblast (RUNX2). These markers were all significantly reduced in neonatal, but not adult, CPCs after 12 days in orbit. Since spaceflight induces pre cardiac mesodermal marker expression, we sought to assess whether markers of the sinoatrial node, which may represent embryonic myocardium maintained in its primitive state,16were modified. Indeed, the sinoatrial nodal markersHCN4andSHOX2exhibited elevated expression in neonatal CPCs and reduced expression in adult CPCs (Fig.4h). Taken together, these findings indicate that spaceflight induces a pre cardiac mesoderm gene expression profile in neonatal CPCs.\n\nGiven the change in developmental status of the cell, we sought to assess whether such changes would affect the proliferative potential of space flown CPCs; hence, cell cycling was assessed using flow cytometry. The Dean Jett Fox model was fitted to fluorescence intensity curves generated for propidium iodide stained neonatal and adult CPCs (Fig.5a). Adult CPCs exhibited a significant decrease in the percentage of cells in the G1/G0 phase (ISS vs Ground: 71% vs 61%, P<0.01) and neonatal CPCs exhibited a significant increase in the percentage of cells in the G2/M phase (ISS vs Ground: 14% vs 17%, P=0.05) (Fig.5b). Neonatal CPCs were more frequently in the G2/M phase both on the ground and following culture aboard the ISS. Interestingly, neonatal CPCs exhibited increases inCDKN2A(14 fold,P<0.05),E2F1(9 fold,P=0.01), andPLK1(8.5 fold,P<0.05) (Fig.5c). These modulators of cell cycling were not significantly altered in adult CPCs (Fig.5d). Furthermore, increased telomerase activity, as indicated by enhancedTERTexpression (Fig.5e), was observed in neonatal (6.8 fold,P<0.05) and adult (21 fold,P<0.01) CPCs. Regardless of age, CPCs demonstrate enhanced proliferative potential aboard the ISS.\n\nCell cycling and proliferation are enhanced following spaceflight in neonatal CPCs. Following 30 days of culture aboard the ISS, CPCs were fixed, stained with propidium iodide, and measured using flow cytometry. The Dean Jett Fox model was then applied to the histogram of propidium iodide fluorescence intensity for ground cultured and ISS cultured CPCsa. Upon analysisb, adult CPCs exhibited a significant decrease in the percentage of cells in the G1/G0 and neonatal CPCs exhibited a significant increase in the percentage of cells in the G2/M phase. This was supported by increased expression ofCDKN2A,E2F1, andPLK1, which function to regulate G1/S arrest, overcome G1/S arrests, and promote G2/M progression, respectively, in neonatalc, but not adultd, CPCs. Furthermore, increased telomerase activity, as indicated by enhancedTERTexpressione, was observed in both groups. In addition to enhanced proliferation, DNA repair gene expression was induced in neonatal CPCs, as indicated by increased levels ofATM,RAD23, andRAD50f. Adult CPCs generally exhibited increased DNA repair genes; however, onlyATMexpression was significantly increasedg.n=3 measurements of four pooled clones per group for cell cycling analysis;n=3 unique clones per group for all gene expression data, except forE2F1,TERT,ATM,RAD23, andRAD50(n=9, three biological samples each measured in triplicate). Data are reported as the mean+/ SEM, *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001\n\nThe broad alterations experienced by CPCs and the possibility of exposure to radiation in the extraterrestrial environment prompted us to consider possible cellular stress response mechanisms, including the expression of DNA repair gene programs. In doing so, we measured increased expression of genes involved in DNA repair, as indicated by elevated levels ofATM(11 fold,P<0.05),RAD23(7.9 fold,P<0.001), andRAD50(21 fold,P<0.05) (Fig.5f). Adult CPCs generally exhibited increased expression of DNA repair genes (Fig.5g); however, onlyATM(24 fold,P=0.001) expression was significantly elevated.\n\nGiven the broad induction of transcripts associated with DNA repair, we sought to characterize the impact of other stressors that could influence cellular function during spaceflight. Neonatal CPCs exhibited a 25 fold increase (P<0.05) inNOTCH1expression (FigS4A, B), which confers protection as part of the adaptive cardiac stress response.17In considering stress associated with spaceflight (FigS4C, D),18,19,20we found thatHSP70was elevated in both neonatal (12 fold,P<0.01) and adult (20 fold,P<0.05) CPCs, whileTXNIP,TP53INP, andHMOX1were all induced only in adult CPCs (21 fold,P<0.01; 2.2 fold,P<0.05; 3.2 fold,P<0.001; respectively). Ultimately, neither adult nor neonatal CPCs exhibited an induction of transcripts associated with the apoptosis pathway (FigS4E, F). Indeed, neither proliferation nor viability was reduced in either age group (FigS5A, B).\n\nIn addition to changes in the regulation of differentiation and proliferation, cytoskeletal alterations were anticipated to occur in response to spaceflight. For this reason, we measured the migratory capacity of ISS cultured CPCs using a Transwell migration assay. Both neonatal and adult CPCs that were cultured aboard the ISS migrated at significantly higher levels in response to SDF 1alpha stimulation (neonate (ISS vs Ground): 2963+/ 15 cells vs 1972+/ 69 cells,P<0.01; adult (ISS v Ground): 2247+/ 28 cells vs 1394+/ 52 cells,P<0.001; Fig.6a). Similarly,SDF1Aexpression was elevated in both neonatal (32 fold,P<0.01, Fig.6b) and adult (37 fold,P<0.01, Fig.6c) CPCs following exposure to low Earth orbit.VEGFAexpression was also significantly elevated in neonatal CPCs (16 fold,P<0.01). Thus, CPCs, regardless of age, demonstrate enhanced migratory capacity aboard the ISS.\n\nCPCs have enhanced migratory capacity following spaceflight. Both neonatal and adult CPCs that were cultured aboard the ISS migrated at significantly higher levels in response to SDF 1alpha stimulationa. Similarly,SDF1Aexpression was elevated in both neonatal and adult CPCs following exposure to low Earth orbitb,c.VEGFAexpression was also significantly elevated in neonatal CPCsb, while most other paracrine and growth factors generally increased regardless of age.n=5 measurements of four pooled clones per group for migration assay;n=3 unique clones each measured in triplicate for gene expression experiments.

    "discussion": "In this study, we found that spaceflight exerts broad effects on the developmental status, proliferative potential, and migratory ability of CPCs, some of which occurred in an age dependent manner. In particular, neonatal CPCs exhibited increased expression of early developmental markers, enhanced proliferative potential, and increased migratory capacity following culture aboard the ISS. Meanwhile, adult CPCs experienced little change in the expression of genes indicative of their developmental state, but exhibited changes to migratory capacity. These findings suggest that broad cytoskeletal modifications resulting from reduced mechanotransduction impart improved migratory and adhesion capabilities (Fig.2a) regardless of age, but that neonatal CPCs are able to propagate or experience additional intracellular signaling events (e.g., calcium signaling) that modify their developmental status. As we have shown elsewhere, one important difference between adult and neonatal CPCs is their epigenetic (i.e., microRNA) environment.12\n\nSeveral microRNAs were observed to be differentially regulated in response to spaceflight in neonatal and adult CPCs. Interestingly, the predicted targets of these microRNAs included activators and repressors of several pathways. A detailed inspection of the putative targets under each pathway impacted by the microRNAs identified in this study revealed the targeting of genes relating to Wnt signaling (FZD3,FZD5,FZD7,FZD8), cytoskeletal regulation (ACTB,ACTG1,LAMC3), cardiovascular development (TGFBR1,BMP2,BMP5,SMAD7), integrin function (ITGB4,ITGAV), extracellular proteins (COL4A2,COL5A1,COL1A1,COL1A2,COL4A1), and Hippo signaling (TEAD1,YAP1,LATS1). Interestingly, miR 16, whose expression was generally elevated in neonatal CPCs and repressed in adult CPCs, directly targetsYAP1, which could account, at least in part, for the age dependent response of CPCs to spaceflight. However, since KEGG analysis only identifies broad categories of genes (i.e., functional categories) that are likely targets of the microRNAs under study, further experiments are warranted to identify the cumulative impact of these microRNAs on signaling in space flown CPCs.\n\nThese results motivated us to assess the overall impact of spaceflight onYAP1, an effector of Hippo signaling that functions with TAZ to regulate transcription. Activation of Hippo kinases, such as through a loss of microRNA mediated repression or through reduced mechanical signaling, results in elevated levels of phosphorylated Yap1 and Taz. This prevents translocation of these transcriptional activators to the nucleus. Similarly, the application of 2D clinorotation to bone mesenchymal stem cells prevented TAZ translocation to the nucleus, thereby preventing the expression ofRUNX2and inhibiting osteogenesis.21Similarly, the decreased expression ofYAP1andRUNX2observed in this experiment indicate that spaceflight reduces mechanotransduction in neonatal CPCs.\n\nIn addition to broadly targeting the Hippo signaling pathway and ECM interactions, select microRNAs that were modified by culture aboard the ISS are known to be critically involved in cardiac development. For example, miR 142 3p is involved in targeting genes involved in early cardiac development, such asTBX5.22Meanwhile, miR 302, which targets the type II BMP receptor to regulate early cardiogenic events, is repressed by Bmp4 in a Smad dependent manner.23Interestingly, we observed both reduced expression of miR 302c and elevated expression ofBMP4in CPCs that were cultured aboard the ISS. Moreover, studies have demonstrated a direct mechanistic role of certain microRNAs in cardiac regeneration. As neonatal mice age, their cardiomyocytes lose their proliferative potential in a manner that is concomitant with increased let 7 family expression,24thereby indicating a relationship between let 7 over expression and reduced proliferative potential. Indeed, let 7c along with miR 99/100, which were significantly downregulated in neonatal CPCs, are also critically downregulated during cardiomyocyte proliferation in a zebrafish model after ventricle amputation.25As part of the amputation injury response, zebrafish cardiomyocytes near the site of injury undergo sarcomeric structure disassembly as a form of limited de differentiation to prepare myocytes for self renewal.PLK1, which was upregulated in CPCs cultured aboard the ISS, is involved in this process.26Interestingly, these changes to the cytoarchitecture of cardiomyocytes and subsequent limited de differentiation appears to resemble the effects of 2D clinorotation12,27and spaceflight on CPCs.\n\nOur laboratory has previously measured changes in microRNA expression in neonatal CPCs induced by 2D clinorotation.12In comparing those findings to the microRNA changes induced by culture aboard the ISS, we found miR 99a and  100 as well as members of the let 7 family, all of which are implicated in differentiation and developmental regulation, exhibit significantly reduced expression under both conditions. Additionally, we have previously compared the effects of spaceflight and 2D clinorotation on the induction of signaling in neonatal CCPs and observed similar activation of calcium and Akt signaling under both conditions. Similarly, both clinorotation and spaceflight induced a gene expression profile that was consistent with an earlier stage of cardiovascular development, and that mechanical signaling processes were involved, at least in part, in mediating these effects. When considered together, these findings indicate that both processes readily alter the developmental properties of neonatal CPCs, possibly through reduced mechanotransduction. Therefore, the recapitulation of spaceflight induced signaling events using clinorotation may represent an avenue by which ongoing studies can be conducted. This comparative study also allows for the separation of effects due to cell culture stress from those due to mechanical unloading since 2D clinorotation, which utilized cell cultures that were maintained under ideal conditions, elicited a similar effect as spaceflight.27\n\nAlterations to microRNA expression as well as changes to ECM interactions in ISS cultured CPCs highlight the significance of the environment in directing differentiation. For example, a single population of mesenchymal stem cells can express neurogenic, myogenic, or osteogenic transcription factors when cultured on soft, moderately stiff, or stiff matrices, respectively.28In our experiments, we observed elevated expression of mesendodermal stage developmental markers in neonatal CPCs. It is likely that ECM interactions prompted cytoskeleton remodeling while modifying intracellular signaling pathways such that proliferation and stemness were enhanced. Similar experiments in different cell types involving clinorotation or a low Earth orbit cell culture system have demonstrated that such systems modify the differentiation potential of stem cells. Mouse ESCs flown as embryoid bodies during the Space Tissue Loss Experiment exhibited a decrease in the expression of markers of terminal germ layer derivatives while maintaining expression of stem cell renewal markers.29However, upon return to Earth, these mouse ESCs differentiated more readily into colonies of contracting cardiomyocytes. Mesenchymal stem cells cultured under conditions of 2D or 3D clinorotation exhibit a reduction in the expression of markers of cartilage and osteoblast formation,30,31while also demonstrating enhanced proliferation potential and the maintenance or enhancement of stemness under such clinorotation.30,32\n\nIn addition to the expression of genes that are indicative of an earlier stage of development, neonatal CPCs exhibited both a reduced capacity to readily form endothelial like tubes, as evidenced by the absence of any tube like structures being formed that are indicative of endothelial potential,14,15and decreased expression of mesodermal derivative markers (i.e., cardiomyocte, endothelium, and osteoblast) in response to spaceflight. Notably, the increased expression of sinoatrial nodal markers may reflect the emerging hypothesis that this unique functional cell type develops from myocardium that retains its primitive phenotype.16Accordingly, the concomitant increased expression of sinoatrial nodal genes and decreased expression of other mesodermal derivatives indicates that spaceflight promotes the modest de differentiation of neonatal CPCs. Additionally, the elevated expression of Tbx proteins, particularly, Tbx3, overlaps with previous reports in the regulation of pre mesoderm (i.e., mesendoderm) gene expression.33\n\nThis concomitant induction of mesendodermal markers and Tbx gene expression reflects the potential therapeutic value of spaceflight for cardiac repair. The critical role of the Tbx family in cardiac development has been well documented34and its application to cellular therapies for cardiac repair is beginning to be explored. For example, SSEA 1+early cardiovascular progenitors expressingT,TBX5, andTBX18, were shown to engraft into non human primate myocardium following infarction.35Meanwhile,Tbx5andTbx18are expressed in highly migratory and proliferative proepicardial cell lineages.36,37These studies have demonstrated an increasingly appreciated observation that Tbx expression is related to the engraftment and function of CPCs following transplantation.\n\nBeyond directing developmental events via alterations in intracellular signaling, disrupted cytoskeletal organization impacts migration. In other models, cytoskeletal re organization induces the expression ofCXCR4, the SDF 1alpha chemokine receptor.38As seen in our experiments, both neonatal and adult CPCs exhibited elevated expression ofSDF1A, which correlates to the age independent increase in migratory capacity of CPCs following spaceflight.\n\nInterestingly, the age dependent changes in developmental status following culture aboard the ISS suggest fundamental differences in adult CPCs. While KEGG analysis demonstrated that functionally similar pathways are likely affected in both adult and neonatal CPCs, only the latter population experienced significant changes to the expression of cytoskeletal genes and early developmental markers. This trend was supported by the significantly increased cell cycle and proliferation patterns observed only in neonatal CPCs. Broad differences have already been reported to exist between adult and neonatal CPCs, including at the genetic/epigenetic12and proteomic levels.39In particular, the secretome of adult CPCs was found to exhibit a greater number of proteins related to anti proliferation, pro apoptosis, and senescence. Meanwhile, the secretome of neonatal CPCs exhibited higher levels of telomerases as well as proteins related to cell cycle, proliferation, and anti apoptosis.39Similarly, we observed age disparate responses to spaceflight in nearly all of these categories. In the context of this experiment, microRNA dysregulation may have exerted a greater effect on neonatal CPCs given their relatively higher levels of expression of genes related to these processes. Nevertheless, the prospective use of CPCs in autologous cardiac stem cell therapies in a predominately adult population requires that these functional differences be elucidated.\n\nAlthough the ISS represents a truly unique opportunity to conduct life science research in space, there are several limitations that do not exist in the well controlled laboratory environments on Earth. In addition to the stress associated with rocket launch, the limited availability of astronauts once aboard the ISS impacts the otherwise routine maintenance of cell cultures. For this reason, future research should consider the influence of various spaceflight related stressors, such as sheer and vibrational stressors, on stem cell processes under normal gravity conditions. For example, we have shown that 2D clinorotation on Earth, which was performed in a carefully controlled laboratory setting, impacted the developmental properties of CPCs in a manner that was similar to spaceflight.27\n\nAs humans prepare to expand our presence in space, it is imperative to deepen our understanding of the nature of cellular adaptation to spaceflight so that we may develop mechanisms by which these molecular changes in cardiac cell types can be countered. Meanwhile, on Earth, we can further explore the therapeutic potential of these adaptations for cardiac repair.",
