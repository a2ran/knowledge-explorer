    "abstract": "Filamentous fungi have been associated with extreme habitats, including nuclear power plant accident sites and the International Space Station (ISS). Due to their immense adaptation and phenotypic plasticity capacities, fungi may thrive in what seems like uninhabitable niches. This study is the first report of fungal survival after exposure of monolayers of conidia to simulated Mars conditions (SMC). Conidia of several Chernobyl nuclear accident associated and ISS isolated strains were tested for UV C and SMC sensitivity, which resulted in strain dependent survival. Strains surviving exposure to SMC for 30 min, ISSFT 021 30 and IMV 00236 30, were further characterized for proteomic, and metabolomic changes. Differential expression of proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis, translation, and carbohydrate metabolic processes was observed. No significant metabolome alterations were revealed. Lastly, ISSFT 021 30 conidia re exposed to UV C exhibited enhanced UV C resistance when compared to the conidia of unexposed ISSFT 021.\n\nKeywords:fungi, simulated mars conditions, proteome, metabolome, Chernobyl, international space station, extremophiles",
    "methods": "Subcultures of the isolated strains were obtained from the Institute of Microbiology and Virology, Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, within the framework of a multiyear collaborative research program, to the Center for Environmental Biotechnology at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). For this study 12 Chernobyl nuclear accident associated isolates were selected (Table 1).\n\nHigh grade aluminum coupons (Al 6061 T6) were precision cleaned for sterility as previously described (Osman et al., 2008). Each coupon was seeded with 100 uL of conidia suspension to contain 105conidia per coupon. Conidia were counted using a hemocytometer (Double Neubauer Counting Chamber, Hausser Scientific, Horsham, PA, United States) after harvesting 5 days grown cultures at 26 degreesC on potato dextrose agar (PDA). Conidial suspensions were diluted in molecular biology grade water (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States) and 105conidia were added to each coupon followed by drying overnight at the room temperature in a bio hood. The monolayers of conidia were confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (data not shown).\n\nAluminum coupons with dried fungal conidia were placed in a plastic Petri dish, without a lid, and exposed to UV C using a low pressure handheld mercury arc UV lamp (model UVG 11; UVP Inc., Upland, CA, United States). The lamp was placed above the sample, and the UV flux at the surface of exposed sample was measured using UVX digital radiometer (UVP Inc.). The exposure time required to produce doses: 0, 50, 100, 500, 1000, and 2,000 J/m2was calculated at 100 uW cm 2. After exposure to UV C 100 uL of 10% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) was applied on each coupon and dried at 37 degreesC for 50 min. Dried PVA along with fungal conidia was peeled using sterile forceps and added to 1 mL of molecular biology grade water (Fisher Scientific). The PVA extraction step was repeated. When PVA was dissolved, serial dilutions were prepared and plated on PDA in duplicates. Colony forming units (CFUs) were counted after 7 days of incubation at 26 degreesC.\n\nSurvival and response of fungal strains under SMC were tested in a Mars simulation chamber equipped with a UV transparent fused silica window according to a previously described set up (Garry et al., 2006;Osman et al., 2008;Peeters et al., 2010). Coupons prepared following the protocol described above were placed in the sterile Falcon tubes and sent to Netherlands. After arrival (1.5 weeks) samples deposited on aluminum coupons were placed inside the simulation chamber and subsequently the chamber was evacuatedviaan oil free scroll pump (XDS5, Edwards Vacuum, Crawley, United Kingdom) to reach a base pressure of 20 Pa. While continuously being pumped, the chamber was purged five times with high purity CO2(99.995%, H20 < 5 ppm, O2< 5 ppm, Praxair, Danbury, CT, United States), before establishing a continuous CO2gas flow to maintain a stable chamber pressure of approximately 600 Pa. Samples were exposed at room temperature to simulated solar light (SF150 with a xenon arc lamp, 150W, Sciencetech Inc., London, Canada)viathe fused silica window of the simulation chamber. The 200 400 nm wavelength integrated irradiance at the sample distance was 58.7 W/m2(Figure 6). Samples were exposed for 5 and 30 min to cumulative doses of 2,670 and 16,110 J/m2, respectively, before being removed from the chamber and placed in sterile Falcon tubes for shipment back to JPL (Pasadena, CA, United States) for further analysis. Upon return to JPL, SMC exposed samples were processed following the aforementioned PVA protocol to assess the survival rates.\n\nUV spectra (200 400 nm) of the solar simulator employed in this study. Other lighting spectra of Mars models are presented along with the integrated irradiance over the wavelength range from 200 to 400 nm.\n\nAspergillus fumigatusstrains were cultivated at 30 degreesC on GMM agar plates whileC. cladosporioidesstrains were grown at 26 degreesC on MEA agar plates starting with 107conidia/per Petri plate (D= 10 cm). After 5 days, agar was chopped, extracted with 25 mL methanol, and 25 mL of 1:1 methanol/dichloromethane each followed by 1 h sonication and filtration. After the second filtration, combined crude extracts from each isolate were evaporated invacuo, suspended in 20 mL of water and partitioned with ethylacetate (20 mL). The ethylacetate layer was evaporated invacuo, re dissolved in 1 mL of 20% dimethyl sulfoxide/methanol and 10 uL was examined by high performance liquid chromatography photodiode array detection mass spectrometry (HPLC DAD MS) analysis. HPLC MS was carried out using ThermoFinnigan LCQ Advantage ion trap mass spectrometer with an RP C18column (Alltech Prevail C183 mm 2.1 x 100 mm) at a flow rate 125 uL/min. The solvent gradient for LC/MS was 95% acetonitrile/H2O (solvent B) in 5% acetonitrile/H2O (solvent A) both containing 0.05% formic acid, as follows: 0% solvent B from 0 to 5 min, 0 to 100% solvent B from 5 to 35 min, 100% solvent B from 35 to 40 min, 100 to 0% solvent B from 40 to 45 min, and re equilibration with 0% solvent B from 45 to 50 min.\n\nExposure of fungal conidia to SMC required using 106conidia/coupon to avoid the shadowing effect (Osman et al., 2008), however such amount of biomass was not enough to perform detailed proteome analyses. Therefore, to observe permanent alterations in proteomes of SMC exposed strains when compared to unexposed onesA. fumigatusstrains were regrown at 30 degreesC on GMM andC. cladosporioidesstrains at 26 degreesC on MEA starting with 107conidia/per Petri plate (D= 10 cm). After 5 days, mycelia and spores from agar plates were collected and stored at  80  degreesC prior to protein extraction at City of Hope (Duarte, CA, United States). The protein was extracted as previously described (Romsdahl et al., 2018). In brief, mycelia, and spores were lysed and homogenized using a bead beater. Protein concentrations were measured by Bradford assay with a bovine serum albumin standard curve (Bio Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, United States).\n\nThe samples were processed for a tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling as described byRomsdahl et al. (2018)with modification. The proteomic profiling ofA. fumigatusandC. cladosporioidesstrains was carried out in two separate TMT LC/MS experiments.A. fumigatusstrains ISSFT 021 and ISSFT 021 30 were labeled with TMT6 128 and TMT6 129, respectively. Two biological samples ofC. cladosporioidesstrains IMV00 236 and IMV00 236 30 were labeled with TMT6 128/130 and TMT6 129/131, respectively.\n\nThe samples were analyzed on an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer with an EASY nLC 1000 Liquid Chromatograph, a 75 um x 2 cm Acclaim PepMap100 C18trapping column, and a 75 um x 25 cm PepMap RSLC C18analytical column, and an Easy Spray ion source (Thermo Fisher Scientific) as previously described (Romsdahl et al., 2018).\n\nAll MS spectra were analyzed using Proteome Discoverer (version 2.2.0.388, Thermo Fisher Scientific) with Sequest HT search engines. Protein databases were eitherA. fumigatusAf293 database from NCBI containing 9845 non redundant sequences or an in house annotated draft genome sequence ofC. cladosporioides(MSJH00000000). The search parameters were described byRomsdahl et al. (2018).\n\nTechnical triplicate measurements for each protein were averaged. Only proteins that were identified with at least one peptide detected in each technical replicate, and quantified in all technical and biological replicates, were considered for the analysis. The identified proteins were then averaged and Log2 transformed. Studentt test was performed to identify proteins that are differentially expressed between each SMC exposed and unexposed group. Proteins withp value <= 0.05 were further evaluated for up  and down regulation using a cut off value of >=+/ 2 fold change. AspGD gene ontology (GO) Slim terms (Cerqueira et al., 2014) were used to study the distribution of differentially expressed proteins among biological processes in SMC exposed ISSFT 021 30 while the cluster of orthologous genes (COG) database (Tatusov et al., 2000) used in CloVR (Angiuoli et al., 2011) was used to study the distribution of differentially expressed proteins in SMC exposed IMV 00236 30.\n\nGenome annotation ofC. cladosporioidesIMV 00236 was performed on the deposited assembly (MSJH00000000) with Funannotate (v1.5.1) (Love et al., 2018). Proteins fromCapnodialesfungi (Dothideomycetes), Swissprot database (Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics Members [SIB], 2016), and transcripts fromCladosporium sphaerospermumUM 843 (Ng et al., 2012) were used as informant sequences. Conserved genes were identified from BUSCO core set \"ascomycota_odb9\" and were used to create training set forab initiogene prediction by Augustus (Stanke et al., 2006;Simo et al., 2015). Theab initiopredictor GenemarkHMM ES was trained using its self training procedures (Ter Hovhannisyan et al., 2008). These predictions along with splice aware aligned proteins using DIAMOND (Buchfink et al., 2015) followed by refinement with exonerate to improve spliced alignment accuracy (Slater and Birney, 2005). Consensus gene models were generated from the combined evidence with Evidence Modeler (Haas et al., 2008). Predicted gene function from conserved protein domains (El Gebali et al., 2018), Swissprot (Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics Members [SIB], 2016) and inferred homology to conserved protein clusters in eggNOGdb (Huerta Cepas et al., 2018), and secondary metabolite cluster prediction (Blin et al., 2017).",
    "results": "Twelve fungal strains isolated from Chernobyl nuclear accident sites, belonging to nine genera, and one ISS isolated strain were included in this study. Eight of the Chernobyl isolates were collected over time from the wall surface of the exploded Unit 4 of ChNPP. The other four fungi isolated from soil within the exclusion zone were included for comparison. The strains used in the study were selected based on their ecological and biological significance from the collection of over 2,000 isolates. Speciation was determined by classical cell and colony morphology based identification techniques. A smaller set of fungi underwent whole genome sequencing. Names, GenBank accession numbers, and their significance are presented inTable 1.\n\nFungal isolates used in the study and their significance.\n\nChNPP, Chernobyl nuclear power plant; ChEZ, chernobyl exclusion zone.awhole genome sequencing., radiotropism.\n\nThe impact of UV C irradiation on the survival of dried fungal conidia is presented inSupplementary Table 1. Out of 13 irradiated strains, all but three (Beauveria bassianaIMV 00265,Fusarium oxysporumIMV 00293, andAureobasidium pullulansIMV 00882) survived exposure to the dose of 2,000 J/m2. Two radiotropic strains,Cladosporium sphaerospermumIMV 00045, andCladosporium cladosporioidesIMV 00236, and the non radiotropicPenicillium citreonigrumIMV 00738 showed survival at the level of 3.48, 3.60, and 2.18%, respectively, which was higher than the 0.1% survival rate observed for the other strains (Figure 1andSupplementary Table 1). Rapid decrease in conidia survivability was observed at dose of 500 J/m2(2 3 log reduction). From that point until the doses of 1000 or 2000 J/m2, the decrease in survival was less pronounced.\n\nUV C resistance of Chernobyl and ISS isolated fungal strains. Purified conidia of 13 strains were exposed to various UV C doses. The UV C survival rates were calculated using formula: N/N0, # of conidia survived at any given dose/# of conidia exposed at Time 0.\n\nBased on the initial analysis of survival under SMC (not shown) four fungal strains were exposed to SMC for 5 and 30 min at the Leiden Institute of Chemistry, Netherlands. All exposed strains,C. cladosporioidesIMV 00236,Apiospora montagneiIMV 01851,C. herbarumIMV 00034 andA. fumigatusISSFT 021, survived exposure to SMC for 5 min, whereas only two strains:C. cladosporioidesIMV 00236 andA. fumigatusISSFT 021 survived exposure for 30 min (Table 2). Probably the most striking observation was the highest survival rate of IMV 00034 after 5 min exposure to SMC followed by complete eradication after 30 min exposure to SMC. However, because the main focus of the manuscript was to discuss the potential of fungi to survive long term exposure to SMC we did not further investigate why IMV 00034 may be highly tolerant to SMC exposure for the short time, but it fails to survive during longer exposure. Nevertheless, it remains an interesting question and a topic for further investigation.\n\nQuantitative analysis of the simulated Mars conditions (SMC) tolerance of selected extremotolerant Chernobyl  and ISS isolated fungi.\n\naIMV, Institute for Microbiology and Virology (academy of sciences), Kiyv, Ukraine.

No significant differences were observed in SM production when comparing samples before and after SMC exposure, including yield or type of compound produced, in either of the strains (Figure 2). However, there appeared to be a tendency of increased SM production yield in both strains following exposure to SMC when compared to unexposed counterparts (Figure 2B,D).\n\nSecondary metabolite production of SMC exposed ISSFT 021 30 and IMV 00236 30 when compared to unexposed ISSFT 021 and IMV 00236.(A)Secondary metabolite profiles of ISSFT 021 30 and ISSFT 021 when grown on GMM.(B)Secondary metabolite profiles of IMV 00236 30 and IMV 00236 when grown on MEA.(C)Metabolite quantification, showing the percent change for each metabolite in relation to unexposed ISSFT 021; significance was determined using Welch'st test.(D)Metabolite quantification, showing the percent change for each metabolite in relation to unexposed IMV 00236; significance was determined using Welch'st test., radiotropism.\n\nThe proteomic characterization of SMC exposed ISSFT 021 30 revealed 51 up and 24 down regulated proteins when compared to unexposed ISSFT 021 (fold change (FC) > | 2|,P< 0.05) (Supplementary Table 2). Analysis of the distribution of differentially expressed proteins among biological processes revealed that 27 proteins were involved in translation and ribosome biogenesis, 11 in carbohydrate metabolism, and 10 in stress response (Figure 3). Further, significantly over represented up regulated biological processes included translation (50% of all up regulated proteins), and carbohydrate metabolic processes (15%), whereas significantly over represented down regulated processes included carbohydrate derivative metabolic processes (12%) (Supplementary Table 3).\n\nAspGD GO Slim terms of differentially expressed proteins in ISSFT 021 30. Differentially expressed proteins in (FC > |2|,P< 0.05) were mapped to terms representing various biological processes using AspGD gene ontology (GO) Slim Mapper.\n\nApproximately 50% of all up regulated proteins in ISSFT 021 30 were involved in translation and ribosome biogenesis, including proteins that comprise the small and large ribosomal subunit (Table 3). The majority of these proteins were reported to be differentially expressed during the early development ofA. fumigatus(Cagas et al., 2011). Both Rpl3 (AFUA_2G11850) and ribosomal protein P0 (AFUA_1G05080), whose expression during conidiation are regulated by BrlAp, were more than twofold up regulated (Twumasi Boateng et al., 2009). A number of differentially expressed proteins were involved in carbohydrate metabolism (Table 4), including isocitrate lyase AcuD (AFUA_4G13510), one of the key enzymes in the glyoxylate cycle (Olivas et al., 2008). Cellobiohydrolases CbhB (AFUA_6G11610) and AFUA_8G01490, both involved in cellulose degradation, and hydrolase AFUA_5G07080 were more than twofold up regulated in SMC exposed ISSFT 021 30 (Adav et al., 2013). A twofold increase in protein abundance was observed for glycerol dehydrogenase GldB (AFUA_4G11730) (Teutschbein et al., 2010), phosphoglycerate kinase (AFUA_1G10350), and hexokinase HxkA (AFUA_2G05910) (Albrecht et al., 2010). Among the proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism that exhibited decreased abundance were malate and alcohol dehydrogenases [AFUA_6G05210 (Teutschbein et al., 2010), AFUA_5G06240 (Cagas et al., 2011), respectively] and mannose 6 phosphate isomerase (AFUA_4G08410) (Gautam et al., 2011). Several proteins with increased abundance were involved in response to stress (Table 5). Dehydrin like protein DprC (AFUA_7G04520), which is known to play a role in protecting cells against freezing (Hoi et al., 2011), and AFUA_1G14090, which is predicted to be involved in histidine biosynthesis (Nierman et al., 2005), were twofold up regulated. Down regulated stress response proteins included the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (AFUA_1G04900), and the formaldehyde dehydrogenase (AFUA_2G01040), and AFUA_8G04890 with a predicted role in response to salt stress (Nierman et al., 2005).\n\nDifferentially expressed proteins involved in translation and ribosome biogenesis in ISSFT 021 30 subjected to SMC.\n\nLog2 fold change of ISSFT 021 30 compared to ISSFT 021 (P< 0.05).\n\nDifferentially expressed proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism in ISSFT 021 30 subjected to SMC.\n\nLog2 fold change of ISSFT 021 30 compared to ISSFT 021 (P< 0.05).\n\nDifferentially expressed proteins involved in response to stress in ISSFT 021 30 subjected to SMC.\n\nLog2 fold change of ISSFT 021 30 compared to ISSFT 021 (P< 0.05).\n\nThe proteomic characterization ofC. cladosporioidesupon exposure to SMC for 30 min revealed that 51 proteins were up regulated, and 218 proteins were down regulated when compared to unexposed IMV 00236 (fold change (FC) > 2,P< 0.05) in response to SMC (Supplementary Table 4). The distribution of differentially expressed proteins in SMC exposed IMV 00236 30 among biological processes is shown inFigure 4. Among differentially expressed proteins 22 were involved in post translation modification, protein turnover, and chaperones, 21 in carbohydrate transport and metabolism, 20 in energy production and conversion, and 17 in translation and ribosomal structure and biogenesis. Interestingly, the majority of the proteins involved in the translation and ribosomal structure and biogenesis in SMC exposed IMV 00236 30 exhibited down regulation (Table 6), which is the opposite expression pattern to ISSFT 021 30. Additionally, a number of proteins involved in post translational modification and chaperones (Table 7) showed decreased abundance, including an aspartic endopeptidase (BS090_008183/ENOG410PH8I), which is an ortholog ofA. fumigatusAFUA_5G13300 (Nierman et al., 2005). BS090_010805/ENOG410PMR5, an ortholog of mitochondrial matrix cochaperone Mge1p (YOR232W) inSaccharomyces cerevisiae(Costanzo et al., 2010) was fourfold down regulated when compared to SMC unexposed IMV 00236. Proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism displayed differential abundance (Table 8), including the fourfold up regulated exo polygalacturonase involved in pectin degradation BS090_001871/ENOG410PG7M, which is an ortholog of An12g07500 inAspergillus niger(Martens Uzunova et al., 2006). Chitin deacetylases BS090_000013 and BS090_000044/ENOG410PMJX, and the chitin recognition protein BS090_010953/ENOG410PMF7 were at least threefold up regulated. Down regulated proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism included phosphoglycerate mutase BS090_004087/ENOG410QEDC, which is an ortholog ofAspergillus nidulansAN8720 with a predicted role in gluconeogenesis and glycolysis (Masuo et al., 2010), glucanase BS090_003291/ENOG410PM6H, and alpha amylase BS090_011829/ENOG410PMDW. Differentially expressed proteins involved in energy production and conversion (Table 9) included up regulated BS090_001715/ENOG410PGTG, an ortholog ofA. nigerNADPH dehydrogenase (An11g08510), and isocytrate lyase and dehydrogenase BS090_001881/ENOG410PGND, and BS090_000939/ENOG410PFHR, respectively.

SMC exposed ISSFT 021 30 exhibited increased UV C resistance (20% of conidia survived the UV C dose of 4,000 J/m2) when compared to unexposed ISSFT 021 and anotherA. fumigatusISS isolate IF1SW F4. Additionally, IF1SW F4 was more resistant to UV C exposure, than ISSFT 021 and clinical CEA10 strain, which displayed similar resistance patterns. The clinical isolate Af293 was the most sensitive, showing 2 log reduction when exposed to the highest tested UV C dose. Exposure experiments were repeated 3 times and showed the same trends.\n\nUV C resistance ofA. fumigatusISS isolated and clinical strains. Purified conidia of ISS isolated (ISSFT 021 and IF1SW F4) SMC exposed (ISSFT 021 30), and clinical isolates (Af293 and CEA10) were exposed to varying doses of UV C. The UV C survival rates were calculated using formula: N/N0, # of conidia survived at any given dose/# of conidia exposed at Time 0. The average fungal conidia survival rates from three different experiments are plotted.",
    "discussion": "Although it has been well documented that bacteria are associated with the spacecraft environment (La Duc et al., 2003,2004;Newcombe et al., 2005), few studies address the persistence of fungi in this environment (La Duc et al., 2012;Weinmaier et al., 2015). Prepared in monolayers, spacecraft associated spore forming bacteria have been shown to survive exposure to UV C and SMC (Newcombe et al., 2005;Osman et al., 2008), but similar studies have not been performed for fungal conidia. Microorganisms exposed as multilayers are shielded from UV penetration (submicron level) and subsequent UV damage is prevented, therefore generation of monolayers of tested cells/spores/conidia is crucial for characterizing irradiation induced microbial lethality. The observed strain dependent UV C sensitivity of fungal conidia was not surprising, as similar conclusions were drawn for UV exposed bacterial species (Osman et al., 2008). Interestingly, ten out of thirteen selected fungal species survived the UV C dose of 2,000 J/m2, while bacterial species in a similar study survived exposure to 1,000 J/m2(Osman et al., 2008), suggesting that some extremophilic fungi are as hardy, if not more, than tested bacteria. It should be noted, that conducting experiments that investigate the protective nature of fungi or bacteria could help in understanding the microbial survival in extreme niches, as bacteria and fungi coexist in the environment, and form communities to survive harsh conditions.\n\nThe space environment varies significantly from Earth. It is characterized by enhanced irradiation and distinct atmospheric conditions. Therefore, it was imperative to assess fungal survival under SMC, as fungi are known to be present during manned space missions. Among the four strains that survived 5 min exposure to SMC two, ISSFT 021 and IMV 00236, survived exposure to SMC for 30 min. Most studies testing survival of microorganisms under SMC have been conducted using bacterial spores or fungal communities. In one such study severalBacillusspp. were tested for simulated Mars UV irradiation tolerance, which resulted in no survival beyond 30 min exposure for all strains exceptB. pumilusSAFR 032, which was inactivated after 180 min of exposure (Schuerger et al., 2006). However, whenB. subtilisspores were exposed to SMC, including irradiation and atmospheric conditions, 99.9% of spores were eradicated within 30 s, and a 15 min exposure resulted in no recovery of viable spores from aluminum coupons (Schuerger et al., 2003). Interestingly, when the more extremotolerantB. pumilusSAFR 032 was tested under SMC, no spores were recovered from the aluminum coupon after 30 min exposure, but bacterial growth was observed once coupons were placed in tryptic soy broth (TSB) (Osman et al., 2008). In this study, recovery of fungal conidia exposed in monolayers from aluminum coupons was possible for both ISSFT 021 and IMV 00236 even after 30 min exposure, suggesting an enhanced ability of fungal conidia to withstand such environments. The results from this study, combined with those revealing that cryptoendolithic fungal communities embedded in rocks can withstand SMC for an extended period of time (Onofri et al., 2012,2015;Pacelli et al., 2018), imply that fungi should be considered as a possible forward contamination source. This is further supported by the fact that the omnipresence of filamentous fungi has been documented in spacecraft assembly facilities (La Duc et al., 2012;Weinmaier et al., 2015).\n\nIt has been reported that upon exposure to space conditions bacteria become more UV resistant (Vaishampayan et al., 2012). Similarly, this study showed that SMC exposed ISSFT 021 30 had a higher tolerance to UV irradiation than its unexposed counterpart ISSFT 021. Additionally, it appeared to be more tolerant to UV exposure than any of the additionally testedA. fumigausstrain, including another ISS isolated strain IF1SW F4 and two clinical isolates Af293 and CEA10. These results suggest that exposure to an enhanced irradiation environment may lead to adaptive alterations that give fungi an increased environmental advantage when exposed to unique space conditions.\n\nOne significant way that filamentous fungi respond to external stimuli is through alterations in SM production. Although these bioactive molecules are not directly necessary for survival, they often confer an environmental advantage (Keller et al., 2005). Both fungal species subjected to SMC, ISSFT 021 30 and IMV 00236 30, displayed slightly increased yield of produced SMs. Such a tendency agrees with previously observed elevated yields of SM in ISS isolated JSC 093350089A. nigerwhen compared to culture collection strain ATCC 1015 (Romsdahl et al., unpublished). Additionally, when the metabolome of ISSFT 021 was characterized and compared to the well studied Af293, production yields of pyripyropene A and fumiquinazolines increased (Knox et al., 2016). Therefore, the observed tendency of increased SM production in strains following exposure to SMC supports the hypothesis that space conditions might have altered secondary metabolite production yields.\n\nThis study revealed that exposure to SMC altered the proteome of both ISSFT 021 30 and IMV 00236 30 when compared to unexposed counterparts. Interestingly, in both species, the highest number of differentially expressed proteins were translation related ribosomal components. Interestingly, exposed to ionizing radiationC. sphaerospermum, Wangiella dermatitidis, andCryptococcus neoformansshowed increased growth when compared to unexposed controls due to electronic changes in melanin (Dadachova et al., 2007), however, in our study only ISSFT 021 30 seemed to follow that pattern, revealing up regulation of translation related proteins. Observed opposite expression patterns of translation related proteins, which underlay species related unique defense system, may have been shaped by the varying environmental origins of each isolate (Gasch, 2007;Heitman et al., 2017). This discrepancy suggests that different species of filamentous fungi alter their growth and development in response to adverse environmental conditions in a species/strain specific manner. Furthermore, the difference in the expression levels of translation related ribosomal protein may lead to the overall up  and down regulation of other proteins in ISSFT 021 30 and IMV 00236 30, respectively. Interestingly, ribosomal protein Rpl17, has been indicated as crucial for survival inA. fumigatus(Firon et al., 2003),C. neoformans(Ianiri et al., 2017), andS. cerevisiae(Gamalinda et al., 2013) especially once grown on glucose. Induced abundance of Rpl17 upon exposure to SMC may suggest that it modulatesA. fumigatusresponse to harsh conditions depending on a carbon source. Several differentially expressed proteins were involved in carbohydrate metabolism and energy conversion, including isocitrate lyase AcuD (AFUA_4G13510) in proteome of ISSFT 021 30. AcuD is one of the key enzymes in glyoxylate cycle, which facilitates fungal growth on alternative C2carbon sources (De Lucas et al., 1999). In addition, AcuE, another enzyme in the glyoxylate cycle, exhibited increased abundance in ISS isolated ISSFT 021 and IF1SW F4 when compared to clinical isolates Af293 and CEA10 (Blachowicz et al., 2019). Further, increased abundance of proteins involved in starvation response was observed in the ISS isolated JSC 093350089A. nigerwhen compared to the well studied culture collection strain ATCC 1015 (Romsdahl et al., 2018). These findings suggest that increased production of starvation response enzymes play a role in the adaptation to space conditions. Several enzymes involved in chitin recognition and degradation were up regulated in IMV 00236 30. These enzymes enable using chitinous debris as an alternative carbon source and allow morphogenetic changes during growth and differentiation (Gooday et al., 1986), which further suggests that alterations in carbohydrate metabolism are an adaptive response to SMC. Interestingly, when protein patterns ofCryomyces antarcticus,Knufia perforans, andExophiala jeanselmeiexposed in multilayers to SMC were analyzed by 2D gel electrophoresis no additional stress induced proteins were observed (Zakharova et al., 2014).\n\nThis study affirms the enormous capability of filamentous fungi to adapt to extreme environmental conditions and thrive in a wide variety of ecological niches. To our knowledge, this is the first report of shotgun proteomic and metabolomic analyses of filamentous fungi in response to SMC. Such a complex state of the art analyses of fungal adaptive responses to space conditions are essential for ensuring safety in the era of future outer space explorations, as fungi will undoubtedly accompany people during space voyages. Thorough understanding of how filamentous fungi adapt to space conditions is important for both maintaining crew health and preventing biocorrosion of the spacecraft, as both opportunistic pathogenic fungi (Knox et al., 2016) and technophiles (Alekhova et al., 2005) have been reported on board of the ISS and Mir space stations.",
