    "methods": "All primers used in this study are listed inSupplemental Table S3.\n\nArabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants were in the Columbia (Col 0) background.Col 0,mur3 3(At2g20370; Salk_141953),mur3 7(SALK_127057),xxt1(At3g62720; SAIL_785_E02),xxt2 1(At4g02500; SALK_101308), andxxt2 2(SALK_150920) were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (www.arabidopsis.org). Homozygous plants were identified by PCR.mur3 1andmur3 2were from a mutant collection described previously (Reiter et al., 1997).xxt5(Zabotina et al., 2008) andxxt1 xxt2(Cavalier et al., 2008) mutant seeds were obtained from Olga Zabotina (Iowa State University, Ames) and Kenneth Keegstra (Michigan State University, East Lansing), respectively.xlt2 mur3 1mutant (Jensen et al., 2012) seeds were obtained from Marcus Pauly (University of California, Berkeley).\n\nPlants were grown in controlled environmental growth chambers (Adaptis 2000, Conviron). Seeds were germinated and grown on Fafard 3B potting soil at 19 degreesC and 15 degreesC with a 14 h light and 10 h dark cycle, respectively, with a light intensity of 120 umol quanta m 2s 1and 70% relative humidity. In a second series of experiments, wild type and mutant seeds were germinated and grown for 10 d on Fafard 3B potting soil at 19 degreesC and 15 degreesC with a 14 h light and 10 h dark cycle, respectively. One half of the plants was then transferred to a second controlled environmental growth cabinet operated at 28 degreesC and 24 degreesC with a 14 h light and 10 h dark cycle, respectively. Images of plants were obtained using a Panasonic Lumix DMC FZ28 digital camera. All image manipulations were performed using Adobe Photoshop CS4 software.\n\nThexxt1 xxt2 1double mutant was crossed with themur3 3mutant. Segregating progenies homozygous forxxt1 mur3 3, xxt2 1 mur3 3, andxxt1 xxt2 mur3 3were identified in the subsequent F2 and F3 generations. Double mutants were generated by crossingmur3 3ormur3 7withxxt1, xxt2 1, xxt2 2,orxxt5. Allele specific primers for each line were used to identify homozygous mutant alleles by PCR.\n\nTotal RNA was isolated from the leaves of wild type and mutant plants using an RNeasy plant mini kit with an on column DNase I treatment to remove contaminating genomic DNA, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). One microgram of total RNA was reverse transcribed using Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen), and one twentieth of the first strand complementary DNA was used for PCR amplification with gene specific primers. Actin 2 was used as an internal control with primers to amplify a complementary DNA fragment.\n\nThe full lengthXLT2open reading frame was PCR amplified with primers XLT2 OE F and XLT2 OE R and then inserted downstream of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter in thepCam35tl:egfps2#4vector (Pattathil et al., 2005). The construct was transformed intoAgrobacterium tumefaciensstrain GV3101, which was then used to transform themur3 3mutant using a floral dip procedure (Clough and Bent, 1998). Transgenic plants were selected by growth on one half strength Murashige and Skoog medium containing hygromycin (15 mg L 1). The presence of the transgene was confirmed by PCR using the gene specific primer XLT2 F paired with vector specific primer P1300 R.\n\nCell walls from the aerial portions of wild type and mutant plants were prepared as their alcohol insoluble residues (AIRs). The tissues were homogenized in aqueous 80% (v/v) ethanol using a Polytron blender (Kinematica). The suspension was centrifuged and the insoluble residue washed with absolute ethanol and acetone and then vacuum dried at room temperature. TheAIR(0.5 1.0 g) was then treated sequentially for 16 h at room temperature with 50 mmammonium oxalate (50 mL), 1nKOH containing 0.5% (w/v) sodium borohydride, and then with 4nKOH containing 0.5% (w/v) sodium borohydride. The 4nKOH extract, which contains most of the xyloglucan, was adjusted to pH 5 with glacial acetic acid, dialyzed against several changes of deionized water, and freeze dried.\n\nXyloglucan oligosaccharides were generated by treating suspensions of theAIRand solutions of the 4nKOH soluble materials in 50 mmammonium formate, pH 5, with anXEGas described (Pauly et al., 1999). Ethanol was added to 70% (v/v) and the mixture kept for 24 h at 4 degreesC. The precipitate that formed was removed by centrifugation and the soluble fraction concentrated to dryness. The residue was dissolved in 500 uL of water and then freeze dried to remove residual ammonium formate. Positive ionMALDI TOFmass spectra were recorded using a Bruker Microflex LT mass spectrometer and workstation. Solutions (5 uL) of the oligosaccharides (approximately 1 mg mL 1in water) were mixed with an equal volume of 10 mmNaCl. A portion of this mixture (1 uL) was then added to a matrix solution (0.1m2,5 dihydroxybenzoic acid in aqueous 50% [v/v] acetonitrile, 1 uL) on the stainless steel MALDI target plate and concentrated to dryness using a flow of warm air from a hair dryer. Spectra from at least 200 laser shots were summed up to generate each mass spectrum.\n\n1H NMR spectra were recorded with a Varian Inova NMR spectrometer (Agilent Technologies) operating at 600 MHz using a 3 mm cold probe and a sample temperature of 25 degreesC.XyGOs (0.5 1 mg) were dissolved in D2O (0.7 mL, 99.9% [v/v]; Cambridge Isotope Laboratories). All two dimensional spectra were recorded using standard Varian pulse programs. Chemical shifts were measured relative to internal acetone ( 2.225). Data were processed using MestReNova software (Universidad de Santiago de Compostela).\n\nThe amounts of xyloglucan present in theAIRwere determined by measuring the amounts of isoprimeverose released by Driselase treatment of theAIR(Fry, 1982). Suspensions of theAIR(approximately 1 g) from mutant and wild type plants in aqueous 80% (v/v) ethanol (100 mL) were ball milled for 16 h at 4 degreesC and 90 rpm in ceramic milling jars (0.3 L) containing a mixture of one fourth  and one half inch zirconia milling beads (U.S. Stoneware). The milledAIRwas collected by centrifugation, washed with absolute ethanol and then with acetone, and then vacuum dried at room temperature. Suspensions of the milledAIR(250 500 mg) in 50 mmsodium acetate, pH 5.2 (30 mL), were then treated for 24 h at 45 degreesC with Spirizyme (30 uL, Novozymes A/S) and Liquizyme (150 uL, Novozymes A/S) to remove starch. The destarchedAIRwas collected by centrifugation, washed thoroughly with deionized water, and freeze dried.\n\nTriplicate suspensions of theAIR(6.25 mg) in 50 mmammonium formate, pH 4.7 (500 uL), containing 0.5% (w/v) chlorobutanol were treated for 24 h at 22 degreesC with 0.25% (w/v) Driselase (100 uL, Sigma Aldrich) prepared as described (Fry, 1982). A second portion of Driselase (50 uL) was added and the suspension kept for a further 24 h at 22 degreesC. Ethanol (1.5 mL) was added and the mixture kept at 4 degreesC overnight. The suspension was centrifuged and the soluble fraction concentrated to dryness. The residue was dissolved in water (1 mL) and freeze dried to remove residual ammonium formate. The residue was dissolved in water (1 mL), and a portion (250 uL) was filtered using a 0.45 um centrifugal microfilter. Portions (10 uL) of the soluble material were then analyzed using a Dionex ICS 3000HPAECsystem with pulsed amperometric detection and a CarboPac PA1 column (250 x 4.6 mm, Thermo Fisher). The column was eluted at 1.0 mL min 1for 5 min with 0.1nNaOH, then with a gradient of sodium acetate (0 100 mm) in 0.1nNaOH for 30 min. The column was washed for 15 min with 1msodium acetate in 0.1nNaOH and then reequilibrated for 15 min in 0.1nNaOH. The chromatography system was calibrated using known amounts of isoprimeverose (Megazyme).\n\nSolutions (10 uL) ofXyGOs in water (approximately 200 ug mL 1) released byXEGtreatment ofAIRor the 4nKOH soluble materials were analyzed using a Dionex ICS 3000 system and CarboPac PA1 column (250 x 4.6 mm; Thermo Fisher). The column was eluted at 1.0 mL min 1for 3 min with 0.1nNaOH, from 3 to 5 min with a gradient of sodium acetate (0 40 mm) in 0.1nNaOH and from 5 to 38 min with a gradient of sodium acetate (40 100 mm) in 0.1nNaOH. The column was washed with 1msodium acetate in 0.1nNaOH for 7 min and reequilibrated for 15 min in 0.1nNaOH. The column was calibrated using known amounts (0.5 2 ug injected) of homogeneous XXXG, XXLG, XLXG, XXFG, XLLG, and XLFG purified fromXEGdigests of tamarind and sycamore cell wall xyloglucan (Tuomivaara et al., 2015).\n\nAIRgenerated from wild type and mutant plants (approximately 500 mg) was treated sequentially with alpha amylase, endopolygalacturonase, 50 mmsodium carbonate, 1nKOH, 4nKOH, and 5nKOH containing 3% (w/v) boric acid to generate fractions enriched in pectic and hemicellulosic polysaccharides. The soluble extracts were adjusted to pH 5 if required, dialyzed (3,500Mrcutoff) against deionized water, and freeze dried. Solutions (50 uL) of each wall extract (60 ug total sugar mL 1water) were then used for enzyme linked immunosorbent assays using monoclonal antibodies that recognize xyloglucan epitopes (seeSupplemental Table S4) as described (Pattathil et al., 2010).\n\nCol 0,mur3 3,xxt1 mur3 3,xxt2 1 mur3 3, andxxt5 mur3 3plants were individually transformed with the SP 2SC GFP construct (Mitsuhashi et al., 2000;Tamura et al., 2005). Transgenic plants were obtained by screening the seeds on kanamycin plates. Epidermal cells of 14 d old cotyledons were analyzed using an inverted laser scanning confocal microscope (LSM510 META, Zeiss) as described (Faso et al., 2009).\n\nLeaves from 4 week old soil grownCol 0,mur3 3, xxt1 xxt2,andxxt1 xxt2 mur3 3plants and hypocotyls fromCol 0,mur3 1,mur3 2,mur3 3,andmur3 3:35SproMUR3seedlings grown for 4 d under constant light at 22 degreesC were fixed for 3 h in 25 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.1, containing 2.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde. The fixed leaves and hypocotyls were processed for light microscopy as described previously (Avci et al., 2012).\n\nHypocotyl cross sections approximately 3 to 4 mm away from the shoot meristem and leaf cross sections (250 nm thick) approximately 3 to 4 mm away from the leaf tip were mounted on ColorFrost Plus glass slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and blocked for 30 min with 10 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.1, containing 0.5mNaCl and 3% (w/v) nonfat dry milk. Hypocotyl and leaf cross sections were processed for immunolabeling with monoclonal antibodies CCRC M1, CCRC M38, or CCRC M88 as described (Avci et al., 2012).\n\nThe following supplemental materials are available.\n\nSupplemental Figure S1.RT PCR analysis of gene transcripts in the mutant lines.\n\nSupplemental Figure S2.TheMALDI TOFmass spectra andHPAEC PADprofiles of theXyGOs generated byXEGtreatment of the 4nKOH soluble materials fromCol 0,mur3 1,mur3 2, andmur3 3mutant plants.\n\nSupplemental Figure S3.TheMALDI TOFmass spectra andHPAEC PADprofiles of theXyGOs generated byXEGtreatment of the 4nKOH soluble materials fromCol 0,mur3,xxt, andmur3 xxtmutant plants.\n\nSupplemental Figure S4.The phenotypes andMALDI TOFmass spectra of theXyGOs generated byXEGtreatment of the 4nKOH soluble materials from individual35SproMUR3:mur3,mur3 1, andmur3 2plants.\n\nSupplemental Figure S5.TheMALDI TOFmass spectra of theXyGOs released byXEGtreatment ofCol 0,mur3 1, mur3 2, andmur3 3AIR.\n\nSupplemental Figure S6.The effect of the absence of light on the hypocotyl length of seedlings carrying single or combined mutations in genes encoding xylosyltransferases XXT1, XXT2, and XXT5 and galactosyltransferases MUR3 and XLT2.\n\nSupplemental Figure S7.RT PCR analyses ofXLT2transcripts in the rosette leaves ofmur3 3:35Spro:XLT2plants.\n\nSupplemental Figure S8.Intracellular accumulation of cell wall polysaccharides inmur3hypocotyls.\n\nSupplemental Figure S9.TheMALDI TOFmass spectra andHPAEC PADprofiles of theXyGOs generated byXEGtreatment of the 4nKOH soluble materials fromCol 0and selected mutant plants grown at 19 degreesC and 28 degreesC.\n\nSupplemental Figure S10.The effects of temperature on the growth and development ofmur3 3plants.\n\nSupplemental Figure S11.Abundance of tandemly repeated XXXG domains in the xyloglucan from transgenic plants.\n\nSupplemental Table S1.Side chain compositions of the xyloglucans isolated from the cell walls of Arabidopsis wild type,mur3 1,mur3 2, andmur3 3plants.\n\nSupplemental Table S2.The amounts and subunit compositions of the xyloglucan present in the leaf cell walls of wild type and selectedxxtArabidopsis mutants.\n\nSupplemental Table S3.Primers used in this study.\n\nSupplemental Table S4.Monoclonal antibodies used for glycome profiling.\n\nSupplemental Protocol S1.Calculating the fraction of a polysaccharide that is composed of domains containingnor more tandemly repeated copies of a sequence.",
    "results": "MUR3encodes anXyG specific galactosyltransferase responsible for most of the galactosylation of ArabidopsisXyG. To address the possibility that alteredXyGstructure leads to the phenotypes of Arabidopsis plants lacking functional MUR3, we took a genetic approach to reduce the amounts ofXyGto undetectable levels in themur3 3mutant. Thus, we crossedmur3 3with thexxt1 xxt2double mutant, which has no detectable amounts ofXyGin its cell wall (Cavalier et al., 2008;Zabotina et al., 2012). Thexxt1 xxt2mutant grows somewhat more slowly than wild type plants but does not have a cabbage like phenotype (Cavalier et al., 2008) or abnormal endomembrane aggregates (Uehara et al., 2014), making it visibly distinct from themur3 3mutant (Fig. 1C).\n\nThexxt1 xxt2 mur3 3triple mutant, which produces no discernibleXXT1,XXT2, orMUR3transcripts (Supplemental Fig. S1A), does not have a cabbage like phenotype and is visibly indistinguishable from thexxt1 xxt2mutant (Fig. 1C). Toluidine blue stained cross sections of wild type,xxt1 xxt2, andxxt1 xxt2 mur3 3leaves are also visibly similar (Fig. 1E). Most of themur3 3cells are smaller than their wild type counterparts, a result that is in agreement with the proposal that these cells have lost the ability to expand normally (Tamura et al., 2005). Glycome profiling (Fig. 1D) and immunocytochemistry (Fig. 1E) indicate that theXyGpresent inmur3 3walls is not fucosylated, whereas wild type walls contain fucosylatedXyG. No discernible amounts ofXyGwere detected inxxt1 xxt2 mur3 3leaf cell walls (Fig. 1, D and E), nor were xyloglucan oligosaccharides (XyGOs) detected afterXyG specific endoglucanase (XEG) treatment of the 1 and 4nKOH soluble materials fromxxt1 xxt2 mur3 3root, leaf, and stem cell walls. Thus, the presence ofXyGis strongly correlated with the cabbage like phenotype of themur3 3mutant. Our data suggest that the absence of the MUR3 galactosyltransferase leads to the formation of dysfunctionalXyG, and that cellular processes are affected more by the presence of this dysfunctional xyloglucan than by eliminatingXyGaltogether.\n\nSince the presence of dysfunctionalXyGis correlated with the cabbage like phenotype ofmur3 3plants, we next determined the structural features ofXyGthat are associated with this phenotype. To this end, theXyGs frommur3 1,mur3 2,mur3 3, andmur3 7, each of which carries a different mutation inMUR3(Supplemental Fig. S1B), were structurally characterized. The structures of theseXyGs have not previously been compared, since only the distinguishing chemical structures of themur3 1XyGhave been described (Madson et al., 2003;Pea et al., 2004). Here, theXyGOs generated byXEGfragmentation of leafXyGobtained from each mutant grown at 19 degreesC (Fig. 2) were characterized using1H NMR spectroscopy (Hoffman et al., 2005), matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight (MALDI TOF) mass spectrometry (MS), and high performance anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC) with pulsed amperometric detection (PAD;Tuomivaara et al., 2015).\n\nThe phenotypes of Arabidopsis plants carrying mutations in one or more of the genes encoding the xyloglucan specific galactosyltransferases MUR3 and XLT2. Plants were grown with a 14 h light (19 degreesC) and 10 h dark (15 degreesC) cycle or with a 14 h light (28 degreesC) and 10 h dark (24 degreesC) cycle. Images were taken when the plants were 4 weeks old.\n\nHomozygousmur3 3andmur3 7plants, respectively, carry a transfer DNA insertion in the region encoding the exostosin like domain and the protein's N terminus (Tedman Jones et al., 2008;Supplemental Fig. S1B). Both mutants produce no detectableMUR3transcripts (Supplemental Fig. S1A) and have a cabbage like phenotype when grown at 19 degreesC in soil (Fig. 2). These mutants are visibly distinct from themur3 1andmur3 2mutants (Fig. 2), both of which produce detectable amounts of the MUR3 protein (Tamura et al., 2005).\n\nThe1H NMR spectrum of themur3 3XyGOs contained no discernible signals corresponding to an F side chain at any position or to an L side chain adjacent to the unbranched Glc residue (Fig. 3;Supplemental Table S1).MALDI TOFMSandHPAEC PADconfirmed that themur3 3XyGis composed entirely of XXXG (63%) and XLXG (37%) subunits (Fig. 4A;Supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). Themur3 7XyGis also composed of XXXG (73%) and XLXG (27%) subunits (Fig. 4A;Supplemental Fig. S3). OverexpressingMUR3under the control of a 35S promoter in themur3 3mutant rescued the cabbage like phenotype (Supplemental Fig. S4) and led to the synthesis ofXyGcontaining near wild type levels of XXFG and XLFG subunits (Fig. 4A;Supplemental Fig. S3). These analyses are in agreement with previous studies showing that MUR3 is a regiospecific galactosyltransferase that adds a Gal residue to the Xyl adjacent to the unbranched Glc in theXyGbackbone (Madson et al., 2003;Pea et al., 2004).\n\nPartial 600 MHz1H NMR spectra of theXyGoligosaccharides generated byXEGtreatment of the 4nKOH solubleXyGfrom wild type (Col 0),mur3 1,mur3 2, andmur3 3leaf cell walls. Plants were grown with a 14 h light (19 degreesC) and 10 h dark (15 degreesC) cycle. The residues corresponding to each group of proton resonances (e.g. 2 Xyl) are indicated at the top of the wild type spectrum. The location of these residues in a side chain (X, L, or F) is indicated.\n\nThe amounts and subunit compositions of the xyloglucan present in the leaf cell walls of wild type and selectedmur3mutant plants. A and B, The subunit compositions ofXyGpresent in wild type and mutant leaves.XyGoligosaccharides were generated byXEGtreatment of the 4nKOH soluble materials from at least three individual plants and analyzed byMALDI TOFMS.HPAEC PAD(Supplemental Fig. S2) and1H NMR analyses (Supplemental Table S1) indicated that XXLG and XLLG account for between 6% and 9% of the subunits inCol 0and35SproMUR3:mur3 3XyG. These subunits were not detected in any of the other plants. C, The amounts of Driselase susceptibleXyGin wild type and mutant leaves determined from the amounts of isoprimeverose released by Driselase treatment of the cell walls.\n\nIn contrast tomur3 3, the1H NMR spectra of theXyGOs generated frommur3 1andmur3 2XyGcontained low intensity signals diagnostic of F side chains (Fig. 3;Supplemental Table S1). Subunits containing F side chains were also discernible in theMALDI TOFMSandHPAEC PADprofiles of themur3 1andmur3 2XyGOs (Fig. 4A;Supplemental Figs. S2 and S4). Moreover, theMALDI TOFMSof theXyGOsubunits generated byXEGtreatment ofmur3 1andmur 3 2cell walls contained low intensity ions corresponding to monoO acetylated XXFG and XLFG subunits (Supplemental Fig. S5). NoO acetylatedXyGsubunits were generated byXEGtreatment ofmur3 3cell walls (Supplemental Fig. S5). Such results are consistent with previous studies suggesting that the F side chain Gal accounts for the bulk of theO acetylated glycoses in Arabidopsis leafXyG(Pauly et al., 2001;Perrin et al., 2003). Our NMR data indicate thatmur3 1andmur3 2XyGs contain approximately 7% and 14%, respectively, of the F side chain present in wild type plants (Supplemental Table S1) and are consistent with the results of recent studies indicating that small amounts of the F side chain are present in the xyloglucan isolated from themur3 1mutant (Jensen et al., 2012;Schultink et al., 2013;Vinueza et al., 2013).\n\nOur data show that the S470L amino acid substitution inmur3 1has a more severe effect on xyloglucan galactosylation than the A290V substitution inmur3 2. Indeed, themur3 1andmur3 2mutants are not identical, since the etiolated hypocotyls ofmur3 1are approximately 50% shorter than theirmur3 2counterparts (Supplemental Fig. S6).Li et al. (2013)have reported that the roots of themur3 1andmur3 2plants are somewhat less sensitive to salt stress than theirrsa3 1andkam1 3counterparts and concluded that RSA3/MUR3/KAM1 is important in the salt stress tolerance pathway. We extend this notion by proposing that the phenotype of eachmur3mutant is determined in large part by the extent of residual xyloglucan galactosylation at the MUR3 specific position.\n\nOur results indicated that reduced extension ofXyGside chains is correlated with the cabbage like phenotype ofmur3 3andmur3 7plants. To determine if this is the case, we overexpressedXLT2in themur3 3mutant (seeSupplemental Fig. S7). The 35Spro:XLT2:mur3 3plants (36 independent transgenic lines identified) are visibly indistinguishable from their wild type counterparts (Fig. 5) and produceXyGcontaining less than 15% XXXG (Fig. 4B;Supplemental Fig. S4). Comparable results were obtained whenXLT2was overexpressed inmur3 7plants. The ability of overexpressed XLT2 to significantly decrease the XXXG content of theXyGwhile suppressing the cabbage like phenotype is again consistent with the notion that this phenotype is correlated with the presence of dysfunctionalXyG. Indeed, the mild dwarf phenotype of thexlt2 mur3 1mutant is also rescued by extending theXyGside chains with arabinofuranosyl residues (Schultink et al., 2013). Such data provide further evidence thatXyGdeficient in extended side chains is dysfunctional, and that the synthesis of dysfunctionalXyGleads to abnormal growth.\n\nThe phenotypes of Arabidopsis plants carrying mutations in one or more of the genes encoding the xyloglucan specific galactosyltransferases MUR3 or the xylosyltransferases XXT1, XXT2, and XXT5. Plants were grown with a 14 h light (19 degreesC) and 10 h dark (15 degreesC) cycle. Images were taken when the plants were 4 weeks old.\n\nPlants that had a wild type phenotype, yet were genotyped asXXT1 xxt2 mur3 3,were obtained during the generation of thexxt1 xxt2 mur3 3triple mutant, which led us to suspect that abolishing the expression of specificXXTgenes suppressed the cabbage like phenotype. To obtain experimental support for this hypothesis, we generated a series of double mutants by crossingmur3 3andmur3 7with thexxt1, xxt2, and xxt5mutants (seeFig. 5), which themselves have wild type phenotypes (Cavalier et al., 2008;Vuttipongchaikij et al., 2012;Zabotina et al., 2012).\n\nThexxt2 1 mur3 3, xxt2 2 mur3 7,xxt5 mur3 3, andxxt5 mur3 7mutants were phenotypically comparable with wild type plants (Fig. 4). The walls of these four double mutants contain 35% to 50% less Driselase susceptibleXyGthan the walls of thexxt1 mur3 3,mur3 3, andmur3 7mutants (Fig. 4C;Supplemental Table S2). Notably, XLXG subunits accounted for at least 59% of theXyGin the normal lookingxxt2 1 mur3 3, xxt2 2 mur3 7,xxt5 mur3 3, andxxt5 mur3 7mutant plants (Fig. 4B;Supplemental Fig. S4). By contrast, the XLXG subunit accounts for 44% of theXyGfrom thexxt1 mur3 3double mutant (Fig. 4B;Supplemental Fig. S3), which retained the cabbage like phenotype (Fig. 5). Such data are again consistent with the notion that this phenotype is a consequence of the synthesis ofXyGdeficient in extended side chains.\n\nTamura et al. (2005)have proposed that the cabbage like phenotype ofkam1/mur3mutant plants is a consequence of abnormal endomembrane organization resulting from the absence of the MUR3 protein. However, the endomembrane aggregation phenotype observed inmur3 3plants was largely suppressed in thexxt2 1 mur3 3andxxt5 mur3 3mutant plants (Fig. 6A) but not in thexxt1 mur3 3mutant. Our data are thus consistent with the notion thatXyGwith a high proportion of unsubstituted XXXG subunits is dysfunctional, and that its presence, rather than the absence of a functional MUR3 protein, is strongly correlated with the presence of endomembrane aggregates. Swollen epidermal cells with endomembrane aggregates have been observed in the roots of plants lacking an isoform of UDP Glc 4 epimerase (uge4;Uehara et al., 2014). Theuge4rootXyGcontains approximately 50% less Gal than wild typeXyG(Nguema Ona et al., 2006;Rsti et al., 2007). Membrane aggregation and cell bulging were suppressed by growinguge4in the presence of Gal, which led to the suggestion that reduced galactosylation ofXyGor arabinogalactan protein is responsible for endomembrane disorganization (Uehara et al., 2014). Nevertheless, a direct causal relationship between endomembrane aggregation and plant growth is unlikely, as Arabidopsis plants carrying a mutation in the coat promoter complex II coat protein SECRETORY 24A have endomembrane aggregates comparable tomur3 3but are not dwarfed (Faso et al., 2009).\n\nEndomembrane aggregation and intracellular accumulation of cell wall polysaccharides inmur3 3plants. A, Endomembrane aggregation inmur3 3plants is suppressed by knocking outXXT2orXXT5.Col 0(wild type [WT]) and mutant plants were individually transformed with the SP 2SC GFP (for signal peptide of pumpkin 2S albumin followed by a linker of GGG and the C terminal 18 amino acid sequence of pumpkin 2S albumin) construct and grown with a 14 h light (19 degreesC) and 10 h dark (15 degreesC) cycle or a 14 h light (28 degreesC) and 10 h dark (24 degreesC) cycle. Images of epidermal cells of 14 d old cotyledons expressing the endomembrane targeted SP 2SC GFP were obtained using an inverted laser scanning confocal microscope. Bar = 10 um. B, Immunocytochemistry reveals intracellular aggregates (see arrows) containingXyGand pectin inmur3hypocotyls. Top, Toluidine blue stained cross sections. CCRC M88 recognizesXyG, CCRC M1 recognizes fucosylatedXyG, and CCRC M38 recognizes deesterified homogalacturonan. Bar = 50 um.\n\nPectic and hemicellulosic polysaccharides are believed to be synthesized in the Golgi apparatus and are then transferred from the trans Golgi network in vesicles that move to and fuse with the plasma membrane (Bashline et al., 2014). The polysaccharides are then released into the apoplast and incorporated into the existing cell wall. Defects in trans Golgi network dependent secretion of polysaccharides in theechidnamutant have been shown to result in the accumulation of intracellular aggregates containing pectin and xyloglucan (Gendre et al., 2013). Thus, we examined polysaccharide secretion inmur3 3, as its cells contain abnormal endomembrane aggregates (Fig. 6A). Intracellular aggregates were clearly visible in the epidermal cells of a toluidine blue stained cross section of themur3 3hypocotyl (Fig. 6B;Supplemental Fig. S8A). Smaller amounts of aggregates were also visible inmur3 1hypocotyls (Fig. 6B). These aggregates were labeled with monoclonal antibodies that recognize xyloglucan and deesterified homogalacturonan (Fig. 6B). Few, if any, aggregates were discernible inmur3 2,wild type (Fig. 6B), or35SproMUR3:mur3 3hypocotyls (Supplemental Fig. S8B). Taken together, these data provide evidence that, inmur3 3hypocotyls and to a lesser extent inmur3 1hypocotyls, cell wall matrix polysaccharides, including xyloglucan and pectins, are not properly secreted and instead accumulate within intracellular aggregates. These data again support the notion that the phenotype of eachmur3mutant is determined in large part by the amount of catalytically functional MUR3 protein it produces.\n\nEarly studies reported thatmur3 1XyGlacks F side chains (Madson et al., 2003;Pea et al., 2004), although subsequent analyses indicated that fucosylated subunits account for up to 5% of themur3 1andxlt2 mur3 1XyGs (Jensen et al., 2012;Schultink et al., 2013;Vinueza et al., 2013). Nevertheless, those values are lower than the values we obtained (Fig. 4A). As our plants were grown at 19 degreesC rather than at 22 degreesC or 26 degreesC as in the earlier studies, we determined whether temperature affects the extent ofXyGfucosylation or plant growth.\n\nThere was an approximately 85% decrease in the relative abundance of the fucosylated subunits in theXyGfrommur3 1andxlt2 mur3 1plants grown at 28 degreesC (Fig. 7, A and B;Supplemental Fig. S9).xlt2 mur3 1mutants grown at 19 degreesC or 28 degreesC do not have a severe cabbage like phenotype but do have short petioles and slightly curved leaves, making them visibly distinct from wild type plants (Fig. 2). The relative abundance of the fucosylated subunits inmur3 2XyGwas comparable at both growth temperatures (Fig. 7;Supplemental Fig. S9). These data confirm thatmur3 1andmur3 2plants retain a residual amount of MUR3 activity and show that, in plants with the allelic (S470L) MUR3 1 protein,XyGgalactosylation at the MUR3 position is diminished by increasing growth temperature.\n\nThe effect of growth temperature on the xyloglucan subunit compositions of selectedmur3and wild type plants. A,XyGsubunit compositions of plants grown with a 14 h light (19 degreesC) and 10 h dark (15 degreesC) cycle. B,XyGsubunit compositions of plants grown with a 14 h light (28 degreesC) and 10 h dark (24 degreesC) cycle.XyGoligosaccharides were generated byXEGtreatment of the 4nKOH soluble materials from at least three individual plants and analyzed byMALDI TOFMS.HPAEC PADanalyses indicated that XXLG and XLLG accounted for approximately 6% of the subunits inCol 0XyG(seeSupplemental Fig. S9).\n\nSomewhat surprisingly, the cabbage like phenotype is suppressed whenmur3 3andmur3 7plants are grown at 28 degreesC (Fig. 2;Supplemental Fig. S10), even though the cell walls of the mutants still containXyG, in which the XXXG subunit predominates (Fig. 7B;Supplemental Fig. S9), and the endomembrane aggregates still exist (Fig. 6A). Thatmur3 3andmur3 7exhibit near normal growth at 28 degreesC is consistent with the temperature dependent changes in the rheological properties of Gal depletedXyG(Shirakawa et al., 1998). Alternatively, the protective mechanisms activated in plants in response to heat stress (Bita and Gerats, 2013) may suppress the effects of the dysfunctionalmur3 3XyG. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which elevated temperature suppresses the cabbage like phenotype remain to be determined. It may well be the case that this phenotype results from an accumulation of temperature  andXyGstructure dependent modifications that affect both cell wall structure and remodeling and endomembrane organization.\n\nOur data show that the extent of side chain galactosylation inmur3 3andmur3 7XyGis reduced by approximately 70% compared with the wild type. A probability analysis (seeSupplemental Protocol S1) using the XXXG subunit abundance in theXyGfrommur3 3(63%),mur3 7(73%), the wild type (25%),mur3 1(48%),mur3 2(47%), and35SproMUR3:mur3 3(29%) plants predicts that domains consisting of five or more tandemly repeated XXXG sequences comprise a much higher proportion of theXyGinmur3 3andmur3 7plants than inXyGfrom the other plants (Supplemental Fig. S11). The existence of large tandemly repeated XXXG domains may lead to the aggregation or otherwise aberrant interactions ofXyGwith itself and/or with other wall polymers (Shirakawa et al., 1998;Whitney et al., 2006;de Freitas et al., 2011). Such interactions together with the inability to extend the side chain adjacent to the unbranched Glc appear to be major factors in the dysfunctional properties of themur3 3andmur3 7XyGand the cabbage like phenotype of these plants. The aggregation of the nascentmur3 3andmur3 7XyGs may prevent the normal movement ofXyGthrough the Golgi and the packaging ofXyGin vesicles for delivery to the apoplast, and may also account for the abnormal membrane organization and the accumulation of intracellular aggregates containing wall polysaccharides inmur3 3plants.\n\nThe differences in subunit composition of themur3 3andxlt2 mur3 1XyGs (Fig. 7) indicate that failure to extend the side chains next to the unbranched Glc is especially detrimental toXyGfunction and to plant growth. Most, if not all, of the galactosyl residues adjacent to the unbranched Glc are further extended with Fuc in theXyGpresent in the wall ofxlt2 mur3 1plants. AlthoughXyGfucosylation is not in itself required for the normal growth of laboratory grown Arabidopsis plants (Vanzin et al., 2002), there is evidence that fucosylation does have a role, albeit less than galactosylation, in the formation ofXyG cellulose composites (Whitney et al., 2006).\n\nDysfunctional xyloglucan may disrupt wall remodeling that is required for plant cells to expand and grow (Pea et al., 2004;Park and Cosgrove, 2012a,2012b). For example, the results of in vitro studies suggest that the decreased solubility of Gal depletedXyGreduces its accessibility to the action ofXyGendotransglucosylases/hydrolases (XTHs) that are believed to be involved in wall remodeling during cell growth (Pea et al., 2004).Li et al. (2013)have reported that the expression of XTH18 is increased 2 fold inrsa3 1. Thus, the cabbage like phenotype may result at least in part from the reduced susceptibilities of theXyGto XTH. These authors also reported a 12 fold increase in the expression of the gene encoding the wall associated kinase WAK1 (Li et al., 2013). Since WAKs are likely involved in wall sensing, cell expansion, and responses to pathogens and environmental signals (Kohorn and Kohorn, 2012), they may have a role in communicating changes in wall properties to the cells of themur3mutants.\n\nOur data favor a model that invokes a dysfunctional xyloglucan structure as the most direct cause of the growth defects of plants carrying loss of function mutations inMUR3. Nevertheless, the possibility cannot be discounted that other cellular mechanisms are responsible. For example, the phenotypes observed in plants lacking the MUR3 protein may be a consequence of anXyGbiosynthesis complex (Chou et al., 2015;Lund et al., 2015) that becomes dysfunctional when no MUR3 protein is present. In this scenario, themur3 1andmur3 2mutants are not cabbage like because the residual MUR3 may still be capable of forming a nondysfunctionalXyGbiosynthetic complex. However, to be consistent with our data, XLT2, which has 42% amino acid sequence identity with MUR3, must be able to substitute for MUR3 to form a nondysfunctional complex whenXLT2is expressed at sufficiently high levels.XLT2does not replaceMUR3when expressed at normal levels. This model also requires that the direct effects of the putative dysfunctional biosynthetic complex are suppressed by eliminating the XXT2 or the XXT5 protein inmur3 3ormur3 7plants. Thexxt2 mur3 3andxxt5 mur3 3double mutants have near wild type morphology and produce xyloglucan with less than 50% unsubstituted XXXG. Models that invoke a dysfunctional biosynthetic complex as the direct cause of themur3 3phenotypes are thus complicated by several difficult to reconcile requirements.",
    "discussion": "Reducing XyG to below Detectable Levels Suppresses the Dwarf Phenotype of mur3 3 Plants MUR3 encodes an XyG  specific galactosyltransferase responsible for most of the galactosylation of Arabidopsis XyG . To address the possibility that altered XyG structure leads to the phenotypes of Arabidopsis plants lacking functional MUR3, we took a genetic approach to reduce the amounts of XyG to undetectable levels in the mur3 3 mutant. Thus, we crossed mur3 3 with the xxt1 xxt2 double mutant, which has no detectable amounts of XyG in its cell wall ( Cavalier et al., 2008 ; Zabotina et al., 2012 ). The xxt1 xxt2 mutant grows somewhat more slowly than wild type plants but does not have a cabbage like phenotype ( Cavalier et al., 2008 ) or abnormal endomembrane aggregates ( Uehara et al., 2014 ), making it visibly distinct from the mur3 3 mutant ( Fig. 1C ). The xxt1 xxt2 mur3 3 triple mutant, which produces no discernible XXT1 , XXT2 , or MUR3 transcripts ( Supplemental Fig. S1A ), does not have a cabbage like phenotype and is visibly indistinguishable from the xxt1 xxt2 mutant ( Fig. 1C ). Toluidine blue stained cross sections of wild type, xxt1 xxt2 , and xxt1 xxt2 mur3 3 leaves are also visibly similar ( Fig. 1E ). Most of the mur3 3 cells are smaller than their wild type counterparts, a result that is in agreement with the proposal that these cells have lost the ability to expand normally ( Tamura et al., 2005 ). Glycome profiling ( Fig. 1D ) and immunocytochemistry ( Fig. 1E ) indicate that the XyG present in mur3 3 walls is not fucosylated, whereas wild type walls contain fucosylated XyG . No discernible amounts of XyG were detected in xxt1 xxt2 mur3 3 leaf cell walls ( Fig. 1, D and E ), nor were xyloglucan oligosaccharides ( XyGO s) detected after XyG  specific endoglucanase ( XEG ) treatment of the 1 and 4 n KOH soluble materials from xxt1 xxt2 mur3 3 root, leaf, and stem cell walls. Thus, the presence of XyG is strongly correlated with the cabbage like phenotype of the mur3 3 mutant. Our data suggest that the absence of the MUR3 galactosyltransferase leads to the formation of dysfunctional XyG , and that cellular processes are affected more by the presence of this dysfunctional xyloglucan than by eliminating XyG altogether.\n\nThe mur3 1 , mur3 2, mur3 3 , and mur3 7 Phenotypes Are Associated with Altered XyG Chemotypes Since the presence of dysfunctional XyG is correlated with the cabbage like phenotype of mur3 3 plants, we next determined the structural features of XyG that are associated with this phenotype. To this end, the XyG s from mur3 1 , mur3 2 , mur3 3 , and mur3 7 , each of which carries a different mutation in MUR3 ( Supplemental Fig. S1B ), were structurally characterized. The structures of these XyG s have not previously been compared, since only the distinguishing chemical structures of the mur3 1 XyG have been described ( Madson et al., 2003 ; Pea et al., 2004 ). Here, the XyGO s generated by XEG fragmentation of leaf XyG obtained from each mutant grown at 19 degreesC ( Fig. 2 ) were characterized using 1 H NMR spectroscopy ( Hoffman et al., 2005 ), matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight ( MALDI TOF ) mass spectrometry ( MS ), and high performance anion exchange chromatography ( HPAEC ) with pulsed amperometric detection ( PAD ; Tuomivaara et al., 2015 ). Figure 2. Open in a new tab The phenotypes of Arabidopsis plants carrying mutations in one or more of the genes encoding the xyloglucan specific galactosyltransferases MUR3 and XLT2. Plants were grown with a 14 h light (19 degreesC) and 10 h dark (15 degreesC) cycle or with a 14 h light (28 degreesC) and 10 h dark (24 degreesC) cycle. Images were taken when the plants were 4 weeks old. Homozygous mur3 3 and mur3 7 plants, respectively, carry a transfer DNA insertion in the region encoding the exostosin like domain and the protein's N terminus ( Tedman Jones et al., 2008 ; Supplemental Fig. S1B ). Both mutants produce no detectable MUR3 transcripts ( Supplemental Fig. S1A ) and have a cabbage like phenotype when grown at 19 degreesC in soil ( Fig. 2 ). These mutants are visibly distinct from the mur3 1 and mur3 2 mutants ( Fig. 2 ), both of which produce detectable amounts of the MUR3 protein ( Tamura et al., 2005 ). The 1 H NMR spectrum of the mur3 3 XyGO s contained no discernible signals corresponding to an F side chain at any position or to an L side chain adjacent to the unbranched Glc residue ( Fig. 3 ; Supplemental Table S1 ). MALDI TOF MS and HPAEC   PAD confirmed that the mur3 3 XyG is composed entirely of XXXG (63%) and XLXG (37%) subunits ( Fig. 4A ; Supplemental Fig. S2, A and B ). The mur3 7 XyG is also composed of XXXG (73%) and XLXG (27%) subunits ( Fig. 4A ; Supplemental Fig. S3 ). Overexpressing MUR3 under the control of a 35S promoter in the mur3 3 mutant rescued the cabbage like phenotype ( Supplemental Fig. S4 ) and led to the synthesis of XyG containing near wild type levels of XXFG and XLFG subunits ( Fig. 4A ; Supplemental Fig. S3 ). These analyses are in agreement with previous studies showing that MUR3 is a regiospecific galactosyltransferase that adds a Gal residue to the Xyl adjacent to the unbranched Glc in the XyG backbone ( Madson et al., 2003 ; Pea et al., 2004 ). Figure 3.

Plants were grown with a 14 h light (19 degreesC) and 10 h dark (15 degreesC) cycle. The residues corresponding to each group of proton resonances (e.g. 2 Xyl) are indicated at the top of the wild type spectrum. The location of these residues in a side chain (X, L, or F) is indicated. Figure 4. Open in a new tab The amounts and subunit compositions of the xyloglucan present in the leaf cell walls of wild type and selected mur3 mutant plants. A and B, The subunit compositions of XyG present in wild type and mutant leaves. XyG oligosaccharides were generated by XEG treatment of the 4 n KOH soluble materials from at least three individual plants and analyzed by MALDI TOF MS . HPAEC   PAD ( Supplemental Fig. S2 ) and 1 H NMR analyses ( Supplemental Table S1 ) indicated that XXLG and XLLG account for between 6% and 9% of the subunits in Col 0 and 35S pro MUR3 : mur3 3 XyG . These subunits were not detected in any of the other plants. C, The amounts of Driselase susceptible XyG in wild type and mutant leaves determined from the amounts of isoprimeverose released by Driselase treatment of the cell walls. In contrast to mur3 3 , the 1 H NMR spectra of the XyGO s generated from mur3 1 and mur3 2 XyG contained low intensity signals diagnostic of F side chains ( Fig. 3 ; Supplemental Table S1 ). Subunits containing F side chains were also discernible in the MALDI TOF MS and HPAEC   PAD profiles of the mur3 1 and mur3 2 XyGO s ( Fig. 4A ; Supplemental Figs. S2 and S4 ). Moreover, the MALDI TOF MS of the XyGO subunits generated by XEG treatment of mur3 1 and mur 3 2 cell walls contained low intensity ions corresponding to mono O  acetylated XXFG and XLFG subunits ( Supplemental Fig. S5 ). No O  acetylated XyG subunits were generated by XEG treatment of mur3 3 cell walls ( Supplemental Fig. S5 ). Such results are consistent with previous studies suggesting that the F side chain Gal accounts for the bulk of the O  acetylated glycoses in Arabidopsis leaf XyG ( Pauly et al., 2001 ; Perrin et al., 2003 ). Our NMR data indicate that mur3 1 and mur3 2 XyG s contain approximately 7% and 14%, respectively, of the F side chain present in wild type plants ( Supplemental Table S1 ) and are consistent with the results of recent studies indicating that small amounts of the F side chain are present in the xyloglucan isolated from the mur3 1 mutant ( Jensen et al., 2012 ; Schultink et al., 2013 ; Vinueza et al., 2013 ). Our data show that the S470L amino acid substitution in mur3 1 has a more severe effect on xyloglucan galactosylation than the A290V substitution in mur3 2 . Indeed, the mur3 1 and mur3 2 mutants are not identical, since the etiolated hypocotyls of mur3 1 are approximately 50% shorter than their mur3 2 counterparts ( Supplemental Fig. S6 ). Li et al. (2013) have reported that the roots of the mur3 1 and mur3 2 plants are somewhat less sensitive to salt stress than their rsa3 1 and kam1 3 counterparts and concluded that RSA3/MUR3/KAM1 is important in the salt stress tolerance pathway. We extend this notion by proposing that the phenotype of each mur3 mutant is determined in large part by the extent of residual xyloglucan galactosylation at the MUR3 specific position.\n\nXyloglucan Side Chain Extension Is Increased and the Cabbage Like Phenotype of mur3 3 and mur3 7 Plants Is Suppressed by Overexpression of XLT2 Our results indicated that reduced extension of XyG side chains is correlated with the cabbage like phenotype of mur3 3 and mur3 7 plants. To determine if this is the case, we overexpressed XLT2 in the mur3 3 mutant (see Supplemental Fig. S7 ). The 35S pro : XLT2 : mur3 3 plants (36 independent transgenic lines identified) are visibly indistinguishable from their wild type counterparts ( Fig. 5 ) and produce XyG containing less than 15% XXXG ( Fig. 4B ; Supplemental Fig. S4 ). Comparable results were obtained when XLT2 was overexpressed in mur3 7 plants. The ability of overexpressed XLT2 to significantly decrease the XXXG content of the XyG while suppressing the cabbage like phenotype is again consistent with the notion that this phenotype is correlated with the presence of dysfunctional XyG . Indeed, the mild dwarf phenotype of the xlt2 mur3 1 mutant is also rescued by extending the XyG side chains with arabinofuranosyl residues ( Schultink et al., 2013 ). Such data provide further evidence that XyG deficient in extended side chains is dysfunctional, and that the synthesis of dysfunctional XyG leads to abnormal growth. Figure 5. Open in a new tab The phenotypes of Arabidopsis plants carrying mutations in one or more of the genes encoding the xyloglucan specific galactosyltransferases MUR3 or the xylosyltransferases XXT1, XXT2, and XXT5. Plants were grown with a 14 h light (19 degreesC) and 10 h dark (15 degreesC) cycle. Images were taken when the plants were 4 weeks old.\n\nThe Phenotypes of mur3 3 and mur3 7 Plants Are Suppressed by Knocking out XXT2 or XXT5 Plants that had a wild type phenotype, yet were genotyped as XXT1 xxt2 mur3 3, were obtained during the generation of the xxt1 xxt2 mur3 3 triple mutant, which led us to suspect that abolishing the expression of specific XXT genes suppressed the cabbage like phenotype. To obtain experimental support for this hypothesis, we generated a series of double mutants by crossing mur3 3 and mur3 7 with the xxt1, xxt2, and xxt5 mutants (see Fig. 5 ), which themselves have wild type phenotypes ( Cavalier et al., 2008 ; Vuttipongchaikij et al., 2012 ; Zabotina et al., 2012 ). The xxt2 1 mur3 3, xxt2 2 mur3 7 , xxt5 mur3 3 , and xxt5 mur3 7 mutants were phenotypically comparable with wild type plants ( Fig. 4 ). The walls of these four double mutants contain 35% to 50% less Driselase susceptible XyG than the walls of the xxt1 mur3 3 , mur3 3 , and mur3 7 mutants ( Fig. 4C ; Supplemental Table S2 ). Notably, XLXG subunits accounted for at least 59% of the XyG in the normal looking xxt2 1 mur3 3, xxt2 2 mur3 7 , xxt5 mur3 3 , and xxt5 mur3 7 mutant plants ( Fig. 4B ; Supplemental Fig. S4 ). By contrast, the XLXG subunit accounts for 44% of the XyG from the xxt1 mur3 3 double mutant ( Fig. 4B ; Supplemental Fig. S3 ), which retained the cabbage like phenotype ( Fig. 5 ). Such data are again consistent with the notion that this phenotype is a consequence of the synthesis of XyG deficient in extended side chains. Tamura et al. (2005) have proposed that the cabbage like phenotype of kam1 / mur3 mutant plants is a consequence of abnormal endomembrane organization resulting from the absence of the MUR3 protein. However, the endomembrane aggregation phenotype observed in mur3 3 plants was largely suppressed in the xxt2 1 mur3 3 and xxt5 mur3 3 mutant plants ( Fig. 6A ) but not in the xxt1 mur3 3 mutant. Our data are thus consistent with the notion that XyG with a high proportion of unsubstituted XXXG subunits is dysfunctional, and that its presence, rather than the absence of a functional MUR3 protein, is strongly correlated with the presence of endomembrane aggregates. Swollen epidermal cells with endomembrane aggregates have been observed in the roots of plants lacking an isoform of UDP Glc 4 epimerase ( uge4 ; Uehara et al., 2014 ). The uge4 root XyG contains approximately 50% less Gal than wild type XyG ( Nguema Ona et al., 2006 ; Rsti et al., 2007 ). Membrane aggregation and cell bulging were suppressed by growing uge4 in the presence of Gal, which led to the suggestion that reduced galactosylation of XyG or arabinogalactan protein is responsible for endomembrane disorganization ( Uehara et al., 2014 ). Nevertheless, a direct causal relationship between endomembrane aggregation and plant growth is unlikely, as Arabidopsis plants carrying a mutation in the coat promoter complex II coat protein SECRETORY 24A have endomembrane aggregates comparable to mur3 3 but are not dwarfed ( Faso et al., 2009 ). Figure 6. Open in a new tab Endomembrane aggregation and intracellular accumulation of cell wall polysaccharides in mur3 3 plants. A, Endomembrane aggregation in mur3 3 plants is suppressed by knocking out XXT2 or XXT5 . Col 0 (wild type [WT]) and mutant plants were individually transformed with the SP 2SC GFP (for signal peptide of pumpkin 2S albumin followed by a linker of GGG and the C terminal 18 amino acid sequence of pumpkin 2S albumin) construct and grown with a 14 h light (19 degreesC) and 10 h dark (15 degreesC) cycle or a 14 h light (28 degreesC) and 10 h dark (24 degreesC) cycle. Images of epidermal cells of 14 d old cotyledons expressing the endomembrane targeted SP 2SC GFP were obtained using an inverted laser scanning confocal microscope. Bar = 10 um. B, Immunocytochemistry reveals intracellular aggregates (see arrows) containing XyG and pectin in mur3 hypocotyls. Top, Toluidine blue stained cross sections. CCRC M88 recognizes XyG , CCRC M1 recognizes fucosylated XyG , and CCRC M38 recognizes deesterified homogalacturonan. Bar = 50 um.\n\nIntracellular Aggregates Containing Xyloglucan and Pectin Accumulate in the Cells of mur3 3 Hypocotyls Pectic and hemicellulosic polysaccharides are believed to be synthesized in the Golgi apparatus and are then transferred from the trans Golgi network in vesicles that move to and fuse with the plasma membrane ( Bashline et al., 2014 ). The polysaccharides are then released into the apoplast and incorporated into the existing cell wall. Defects in trans Golgi network dependent secretion of polysaccharides in the echidna mutant have been shown to result in the accumulation of intracellular aggregates containing pectin and xyloglucan ( Gendre et al., 2013 ). Thus, we examined polysaccharide secretion in mur3 3 , as its cells contain abnormal endomembrane aggregates ( Fig. 6A ). Intracellular aggregates were clearly visible in the epidermal cells of a toluidine blue stained cross section of the mur3 3 hypocotyl ( Fig. 6B ; Supplemental Fig. S8A ). Smaller amounts of aggregates were also visible in mur3 1 hypocotyls ( Fig. 6B ). These aggregates were labeled with monoclonal antibodies that recognize xyloglucan and deesterified homogalacturonan ( Fig. 6B ). Few, if any, aggregates were discernible in mur3 2, wild type ( Fig. 6B ), or 35S pro MUR3:mur3 3 hypocotyls ( Supplemental Fig. S8B ). Taken together, these data provide evidence that, in mur3 3 hypocotyls and to a lesser extent in mur3 1 hypocotyls, cell wall matrix polysaccharides, including xyloglucan and pectins, are not properly secreted and instead accumulate within intracellular aggregates. These data again support the notion that the phenotype of each mur3 mutant is determined in large part by the amount of catalytically functional MUR3 protein it produces.\n\nTemperature Affects the Growth of mur3 Plants and the Catalytic Activity of the Mutated MUR3 Protein Early studies reported that mur3 1 XyG lacks F side chains ( Madson et al., 2003 ; Pea et al., 2004 ), although subsequent analyses indicated that fucosylated subunits account for up to 5% of the mur3 1 and xlt2 mur3 1 XyG s ( Jensen et al., 2012 ; Schultink et al., 2013 ; Vinueza et al., 2013 ). Nevertheless, those values are lower than the values we obtained ( Fig. 4A ). As our plants were grown at 19 degreesC rather than at 22 degreesC or 26 degreesC as in the earlier studies, we determined whether temperature affects the extent of XyG fucosylation or plant growth. There was an approximately 85% decrease in the relative abundance of the fucosylated subunits in the XyG from mur3 1 and xlt2 mur3 1 plants grown at 28 degreesC ( Fig. 7, A and B ; Supplemental Fig. S9 ). xlt2 mur3 1 mutants grown at 19 degreesC or 28 degreesC do not have a severe cabbage like phenotype but do have short petioles and slightly curved leaves, making them visibly distinct from wild type plants ( Fig. 2 ). The relative abundance of the fucosylated subunits in mur3 2 XyG was comparable at both growth temperatures ( Fig. 7 ; Supplemental Fig. S9 ). These data confirm that mur3 1 and mur3 2 plants retain a residual amount of MUR3 activity and show that, in plants with the allelic (S470L) MUR3 1 protein, XyG galactosylation at the MUR3 position is diminished by increasing growth temperature. Figure 7. Open in a new tab The effect of growth temperature on the xyloglucan subunit compositions of selected mur3 and wild type plants. A, XyG subunit compositions of plants grown with a 14 h light (19 degreesC) and 10 h dark (15 degreesC) cycle. B, XyG subunit compositions of plants grown with a 14 h light (28 degreesC) and 10 h dark (24 degreesC) cycle. XyG oligosaccharides were generated by XEG treatment of the 4 n KOH soluble materials from at least three individual plants and analyzed by MALDI TOF MS . HPAEC   PAD analyses indicated that XXLG and XLLG accounted for approximately 6% of the subunits in Col 0 XyG (see Supplemental Fig. S9 ). Somewhat surprisingly, the cabbage like phenotype is suppressed when mur3 3 and mur3 7 plants are grown at 28 degreesC ( Fig. 2 ; Supplemental Fig. S10 ), even though the cell walls of the mutants still contain XyG , in which the XXXG subunit predominates ( Fig. 7B ; Supplemental Fig. S9 ), and the endomembrane aggregates still exist ( Fig. 6A ). That mur3 3 and mur3 7 exhibit near normal growth at 28 degreesC is consistent with the temperature dependent changes in the rheological properties of Gal depleted XyG ( Shirakawa et al., 1998 ). Alternatively, the protective mechanisms activated in plants in response to heat stress ( Bita and Gerats, 2013 ) may suppress the effects of the dysfunctional mur3 3 XyG . Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which elevated temperature suppresses the cabbage like phenotype remain to be determined. It may well be the case that this phenotype results from an accumulation of temperature  and XyG structure dependent modifications that affect both cell wall structure and remodeling and endomembrane organization.\n\nDysfunctional Xyloglucan and Plant Growth Our data show that the extent of side chain galactosylation in mur3 3 and mur3 7 XyG is reduced by approximately 70% compared with the wild type. A probability analysis (see Supplemental Protocol S1 ) using the XXXG subunit abundance in the XyG from mur3 3 (63%), mur3 7 (73%), the wild type (25%), mur3 1 (48%), mur3 2 (47%), and 35S pro MUR3 : mur3 3 (29%) plants predicts that domains consisting of five or more tandemly repeated XXXG sequences comprise a much higher proportion of the XyG in mur3 3 and mur3 7 plants than in XyG from the other plants ( Supplemental Fig. S11 ). The existence of large tandemly repeated XXXG domains may lead to the aggregation or otherwise aberrant interactions of XyG with itself and/or with other wall polymers ( Shirakawa et al., 1998 ; Whitney et al., 2006 ; de Freitas et al., 2011 ). Such interactions together with the inability to extend the side chain adjacent to the unbranched Glc appear to be major factors in the dysfunctional properties of the mur3 3 and mur3 7 XyG and the cabbage like phenotype of these plants. The aggregation of the nascent mur3 3 and mur3 7 XyG s may prevent the normal movement of XyG through the Golgi and the packaging of XyG in vesicles for delivery to the apoplast, and may also account for the abnormal membrane organization and the accumulation of intracellular aggregates containing wall polysaccharides in mur3 3 plants. The differences in subunit composition of the mur3 3 and xlt2 mur3 1 XyG s ( Fig. 7 ) indicate that failure to extend the side chains next to the unbranched Glc is especially detrimental to XyG function and to plant growth. Most, if not all, of the galactosyl residues adjacent to the unbranched Glc are further extended with Fuc in the XyG present in the wall of xlt2 mur3 1 plants. Although XyG fucosylation is not in itself required for the normal growth of laboratory grown Arabidopsis plants ( Vanzin et al., 2002 ), there is evidence that fucosylation does have a role, albeit less than galactosylation, in the formation of XyG  cellulose composites ( Whitney et al., 2006 ). Dysfunctional xyloglucan may disrupt wall remodeling that is required for plant cells to expand and grow ( Pea et al., 2004 ; Park and Cosgrove, 2012a , 2012b ). For example, the results of in vitro studies suggest that the decreased solubility of Gal depleted XyG reduces its accessibility to the action of XyG endotransglucosylases/hydrolases (XTHs) that are believed to be involved in wall remodeling during cell growth ( Pea et al., 2004 ). Li et al. (2013) have reported that the expression of XTH18 is increased 2 fold in rsa3 1 . Thus, the cabbage like phenotype may result at least in part from the reduced susceptibilities of the XyG to XTH. These authors also reported a 12 fold increase in the expression of the gene encoding the wall associated kinase WAK1 ( Li et al., 2013 ). Since WAKs are likely involved in wall sensing, cell expansion, and responses to pathogens and environmental signals ( Kohorn and Kohorn, 2012 ), they may have a role in communicating changes in wall properties to the cells of the mur3 mutants. Our data favor a model that invokes a dysfunctional xyloglucan structure as the most direct cause of the growth defects of plants carrying loss of function mutations in MUR3 . Nevertheless, the possibility cannot be discounted that other cellular mechanisms are responsible. For example, the phenotypes observed in plants lacking the MUR3 protein may be a consequence of an XyG biosynthesis complex ( Chou et al., 2015 ; Lund et al., 2015 ) that becomes dysfunctional when no MUR3 protein is present. In this scenario, the mur3 1 and mur3 2 mutants are not cabbage like because the residual MUR3 may still be capable of forming a nondysfunctional XyG biosynthetic complex. However, to be consistent with our data, XLT2, which has 42% amino acid sequence identity with MUR3, must be able to substitute for MUR3 to form a nondysfunctional complex when XLT2 is expressed at sufficiently high levels. XLT2 does not replace MUR3 when expressed at normal levels. This model also requires that the direct effects of the putative dysfunctional biosynthetic complex are suppressed by eliminating the XXT2 or the XXT5 protein in mur3 3 or mur3 7 plants. The xxt2 mur3 3 and xxt5 mur3 3 double mutants have near wild type morphology and produce xyloglucan with less than 50% unsubstituted XXXG. Models that invoke a dysfunctional biosynthetic complex as the direct cause of the mur3 3 phenotypes are thus complicated by several difficult to reconcile requirements.",
    "conclusion": "We have shown that Arabidopsis mutants devoid of the F side chain galactosyltransferase MURUS3 form xyloglucan that lacks F side chains and contains much less galactosylated Xyl than wild type xyloglucan. This xyloglucan structure is dysfunctional, as it leads to mutants that exhibit numerous growth defects. Near normal growth is restored by eliminating the xyloglucan altogether or by increasing the extent of its galactosylation. The altered growth of themur3family of mutants and their responses to temperature, pathogens (Tedman Jones et al., 2008), and salt stress (Li et al., 2013) reveal how modifying one element of a biochemical network, in this case, xyloglucan biosynthesis, may disturb diverse cellular and physiological processes. Such data provide additional evidence in support of the notion that altering wall structure affects numerous aspects of plant life (Seifert and Blaukopf, 2010). Thus, themur3mutants provide a unique opportunity to increase our understanding of how changes in cell wall biosynthesis and structure affect plant growth and development as well as disease resistance and responses to environmental stimuli."
