    "abstract": "Spaceflight missions can cause immune system dysfunction in astronauts with little understanding of immune outcomes in deep space. This study assessed immune responses in mice following ground based, simulated deep spaceflight conditions, compared with data from astronauts on International Space Station missions. For ground studies, we simulated microgravity using the hindlimb unloaded mouse model alone or in combination with acute simulated galactic cosmic rays or solar particle events irradiation. Immune profiling results revealed unique immune diversity following each experimental condition, suggesting each stressor results in distinct circulating immune responses, with clear consequences for deep spaceflight. Circulating plasma microRNA sequence analysis revealed involvement in immune system dysregulation. Furthermore, a large astronaut cohort showed elevated inflammation during low Earth orbit missions, thereby supporting our simulated ground experiments in mice. Herein, circulating immune biomarkers are defined by distinct deep space irradiation types coupled to simulated microgravity and could be targets for future space health initiatives.\n\nSubject Areas:Immunology, Space Sciences",

    "results": "Mice were exposed to acute, 0.5 Gy simplified GCR simulation (GCR sim), 1 Gy SPE simulation (SPE sim), or 5Gy gamma irradiation, singly or in combination with HU (14 days total) and were weighed on days  3, 0, 7, and 14 (Figure1A). Gamma irradiation was included to calculate the RBE of GCR sim and SPE sim. As charged particles generally have a higher RBE than photons (gamma irradiation) we used an elevated dose of 5 Gy. The results revealed significant difference in body weight across GCR and SPE irradiation combined with HU groups at 24h post irradiation exposures (i.e., day 14) (Figure1B). Euthanasia was performed on day 14, and select immune organs were collected and weighed to determine if spaceflight exposures caused weight differences. Interestingly, all irradiation groups with HU had a significant decrease in spleen weight, compared to NL Sham controls with intergroup comparisons between GCR and gamma (Figure1C). For the thymus, SPE irradiation in combination with HU groups were significantly reduced in weight, along with both NL  and HU gamma cohorts, compared with NL Sham controls (Figure1D). To address whether there are fewer white blood cells (WBCs) circulating within blood, which may result in weight disparities in the immune organs, common leukocyte antigen (CD45), which labels all leukocytes, was analyzed by flow cytometry within the total doublet discriminated (DD) events (Figures 1E 1G). The results showed reduced CD45+circulating leukocyte populations within DD events following all exposures, compared to NL Sham controls (Figures 1F and 1G). Collectively, these results indicate that 24h following combined exposures, there are immune system decrements, in both primary (thymus; SPE irradiation) and secondary (spleen; GCR and gamma irradiation) immune organs, which may be associated with reduced circulating leukocytes.\n\nImmune Organs and Total Leukocyte Populations Display Disparities following Simulated Deep Space Exposures\n\n(A) Experimental plan timeline: 15 week old female C57BL/6J mice were cage acclimated for 3days (day  3) before experimental initiation (0). Mice were either normally loaded (NL, shaded) or hindlimb unloaded (HU, not shaded) for 14days. On day 13 mice were whole body irradiated with Sham (0 Gy, green), galactic cosmic rays (GCR, 0.5 Gy, blue), solar particle events (SPE, 1 Gy, red), or gamma (5 Gy, yellow) irradiation types (formulas described inMethods). 24h post irradiation (day 14), mice were euthanized and blood and tissues were collected. Body weights were measured on days  3, 0, 7, and 14. Tissue weights were measured on collection day 14.\n\n(B G) (B) Body weights were measured on days  3, 0, 7, and 14. Immune organ weights of the spleen (C) and the thymus (D) were performed on collection day 14 and normalized to total body weight (g/g). Flow cytometric gating scheme to collect singlets, remove doublets, (\"DD\" denotes doublet discrimination), and identify CD45+events (E). Percent (%) (F) and absolute counts (G) of total leukocyte populations (CD45+/all doublet discriminated events, DD) displayed for each exposure group. A Grubbs test was performed on all datasets followed by testing for normal distribution via a Kolmogorov Smirnov test. If data were normally distributed, a one way ANOVA Dunnett test was performed to compare NL and HU controls to all groups and a parametric unpaired t test with Welsh's correction was performed to compare between similar irradiation groups. If normality was not passed, both a non parametric Kruskal Wallis test with a Dunn's posthoc analysis to compare NL and HU controls with all groups and a non parametric Mann Whitney U test comparing between similar irradiation groups were performed. Data in (B) represent a scatterplot. (C and D) Data represent a box and whiskers plot with minimum and maximum data points. (F and G) Bar graphs data represent means+/  SEM (p< 0.05, n= 8 10 per group). \"\" denotes significant difference between NL Sham and associated groups, \"#\" denotes significant difference between HU Sham and associated groups, and intergroup \"brackets with a &\" denotes significant difference between each group. Filled circles, boxes, and bars denote normal loaded (NL), and non filled circles, boxes, and bars denote hindlimb unloaded (HU).\n\nSubgroups of leukocytes were analyzed to determine the profile of innate immune cells following 24h of acute, simulated GCR, SPE, or gamma irradiation exposures, singly or in combination with HU (14days). Gating schemes within CD45+events displayed neutrophils (Ly6ghighCD11b+), eosinophils (Ly6glowCD11b+), monocytes (Ly6g CD11b+), B cells (CD20+NK1.1 /CD45+) (Figures 2A,3A, andS1A S1C), and NK/NKT cells (CD20 NK1.1+/CD45+) (Figures 3A, 3C andS1D). The results revealed elevated neutrophil populations in HU Sham,   SPE, and gamma irradiation in combination with HU groups, compared with NL Sham controls (Figure2C). No significant differences were seen between monocytes (Figure2B) or neutrophils (Figure2C) with GCR or SPE irradiation alone compared with NL Sham controls. There were no differences noted across all innate immune groups following GCR irradiation, singly or in combination with HU (Figures 2B 2D and3C). Interestingly, a significant elevation in eosinophils (Figure2D) and NK/NKT (Figure3C) cells was observed in single SPE and gamma irradiation, that was suppressed in combination with HU, which indicates SPE and gamma irradiation selectively targets these cell types compared to NL Sham controls. Moreover, these results also indicate suppressed inflammation in response to combination SPE and gamma irradiation with HU. Interestingly, gamma irradiation alone induced all innate immune profiles, compared with NL Sham controls, which was reduced in combination with HU (Figures 2B 2D and3C), indicating suppressed inflammation in gamma irradiation in combination with HU. Collectively, these trends suggest that higher doses of ionizing irradiation may be more toxic, causing heightened immunogenicity.\n\nInnate Immune Profiles Reveal Elevated Populations in SPE and Gamma Irradiation that Are Selectively Suppressed in Combination with HU, No Difference in Population with GCR Irradiation +/  HU\n\n(A D) (A) Representative flow plots are displayed for percentage CD45+CD11b cells (bottom left box), monocytes (bottom right box), neutrophils (top right box), and eosinophils (between right boxes). Percentage (%) of monocytes (Ly6g CD11b+/CD45+) (B), neutrophils (Ly6ghighCD11b+/CD45+) (C), and eosinophils (Ly6glowCD11b+/CD45+) (D), are displayed within each exposure group. Bar graph data represent means+/  SEM (p< 0.05, n= 8 10 per group). Statistical tests and labels are the same asFigure1.\n\nB and NK/NKT Cells Reveal Differential Population Percentages following Deep Space Exposures\n\n(A) Representative flow gating for B and NK/NKT cells percentages.\n\n(B) Percentage (%) B cells (CD20+NK1.1 /CD45+) are displayed within total leukocyte populations.\n\n(C) Median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of cell surface expression of CD20 on all CD45+cells.\n\n(D) Percent (%) of NK/NKT cells (NK1.1+CD20 /CD45+).

Statistical tests and labels are the same asFigure1.\n\nLymphocytes are sensitive to ionizing irradiation exposures, whereby irradiation initiates DNA damage triggering apoptosis (Schaue and McBride, 2012). To assess the effects of deep space relevant exposures on lymphocyte profiles we first assessed B cell populations. The gating scheme for B cells is displayed inFigure3A.Although no difference was revealed for GCR irradiation alone, compared with NL Sham controls, all other irradiation groups, singly or in combination with HU resulted in significant reduction of B cells, compared to NL Sham controls (Figures 3B andS1E). These results suggest possible impairments in antibody producing, plasma cell differentiation. To confirm impaired B cell differentiation median fluorescent intensity (MFI) of cell surface CD20 was assessed, as CD20 expression levels are reduced during B cell maturation into plasma cells (Robillard etal., 2014;Styles etal., 2017). There was no reduction in B cell surface expression of CD20 (Figure3C), suggesting B cell differentiation processes are impaired with GCR and SPE irradiation, singly or in combination with HU, compared with NL Sham controls. Tcell lineages were also characterized by flow cytometry in blood following space relevant conditions, including T helper (Th, CD8 CD4+/CD3+) and T cytotoxic (Tc, CD8+CD4 /CD3+) lymphocytes (Figure4A). The results revealed GCR irradiation singly and in combination with HU significantly reduced circulating Thand Tclymphocytes, compared to NL Sham controls, whereas no significant effects in Tcell populations were observed with gamma irradiation (Figures 4B 4E). In addition, SPE irradiation exposures (single and combination groups) also reduced Tclymphocyte numbers (Figures 3C and 3E). Collectively, these results indicate impairment in B cell and effector/central memory Tcell adaptive immune responses following deep space relevant exposures, which can pose a major health risk limitation on future human exploration missions.\n\nLymphocyte Immune Profiles Indicate T Cytotoxic and T Helper Effector Cells Are Reduced following GCR and SPE Irradiation\n\n(A E) (A) Representative flow gating for T cytotoxic (Tc) and T helper (Th) cells within CD3+doublet discriminated events. Percentage (%) and absolute counts of T helper (Th) cells (CD4+CD8 /CD3+) (B and D, respectively) and T cytotoxic (Tc) cells (CD4 CD8+/CD3+) (C and E, respectively) are displayed. Bar graph data represent means+/  SEM (p< 0.05, n= 7 10 per group). Statistical tests and labels are the same asFigure1.\n\nTo assess the mechanisms involved in reduced Tcell percentage, we characterized the cell surface expression of IL 7R on circulating lymphocytes (Figures 5A and 5B). IL 7R expression varies throughout Tcell development, whereby it is expressed on single positive naive Tcells, but not activated Tcells, and then is re expressed on memory Tcells (Mazzucchelli and Durum, 2007). Furthermore, elevated IL 7R has been linked to multiple inflammatory diseases (Anderson etal., 2011;Belarif etal., 2018;Willis etal., 2012). The results revealed cell surface IL 7R median fluorescence intensity (MFI) was elevated in HU Sham, compared to NL Sham controls, which suggests enhanced inflammation following HU for 14days (Figure5C). GCR and SPE irradiation, singly and in combination with HU, resulted in no significant differences in IL 7R expression, compared to NL Sham alone, other than GCR irradiation with HU, suggesting GCR irradiation in combination with HU may have induced Tcell activation (Figure5C). Percentage (%) lymphocytes (SSC A versus CD45+, plot example inFigure1G) further supports the damaging effects of GCR and SPE irradiation on these population types (Figure5D). Elevated neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), a clinical biomarker forPaul et al., 2020inflammation (Isaac etal., 2016), was elevated in HU Sham controls, and in all irradiation only groups, compared to NL Sham controls, with partial reduction in combination with HU (Figure5E). Collectively, these results suggest select Tcell activation and inflammation following deep space simulation.\n\nDifferential Expression of IL 7R Surface Expression and Elevated Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) in Simulated Deep Space Exposures\n\n(A and B) Representative flow plot (NL Sham control only) for lymphocytes within all events that have been doublet discriminated (DD) (A) and IL 7R median fluorescent intensity (MFI) histograms (NL  and HU Sham only) within lymphocytes (B).\n\n(C) MFI of IL 7R within lymphocytes is shown.\n\n(D) Percentage (%) lymphocytes are displayed (SSC A versus CD45+), as shown inFigure1G.\n\n(E) Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), a measurement of subclinicalPaul et al., 2020inflammation (Isaac etal., 2016), is shown. (C E) Bar graph data represent means+/  SEM (p< 0.05, n= 6 10 per group). Statistical tests and labels are the same asFigure1.\n\nSelect cytokine biomarkers consisting of pro  and anti inflammatory markers were assessed in whole blood by qPCR. The cytokine panel includedIfn gamma,Il 4,Il 1beta,Tnf ,iNOS,Il 6, andIl 10, and showed that unique cytokine profiles are induced in each exposure group (Figure6A).Il 1beta, a pro inflammatory cytokine and marker of the inflammasome complex (Rathinam and Fitzgerald, 2016), displayed elevated expression following SPE irradiation in the single exposure group, compared to NL sham controls (Figure6B). GCR irradiation displayed significant suppression ofIl 1betain combination with HU, compared to GCR irradiation alone (Figure6B). These results suggest combined simulated deep space exposures may have suppressed inflammation.Il 6, another pro inflammatory cytokine well known for its involvement in the acute phase response (Tanaka etal., 2014), was induced in HU, compared with NL Sham controls (Figure6C), suggesting exposure to simulated microgravity may induce inflammation. Interestingly, GCR irradiation in combination with HU resulted inIl 6suppression (Figure6C), supporting suppression of inflammation in combined deep space conditions of GCR irradiation and HU.Ifn , is a cytokine produced by Tccells, Th1 cells, NK/NKT cells, and innate lymphoid cells 1 subtype 1 (ILC1) (Colonna, 2018). It has been associated with NK cell activity (Lusty etal., 2017) and improved macrophage antigen presentation (Kak etal., 2018). We found in comparison to NL sham controls,Ifn gammawas significantly upregulated in both GCR irradiation exposure groups, singly or combined with HU (Figure6D). Furthermore, gamma irradiation resulted in increased expression ofIfn gammain combination with HU, compared with gamma irradiation alone (Figure6D). IL 4 is typically produced by Th2 and T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, and its primary role promotes cellular survival (Keegan and Zamorano, 1998). We found significant fold elevation ofIl 4in all irradiation groups in combination with HU, compared to NL Sham controls (Figure6E), suggesting this cytokine may be critically involved in promoting cell survival in the remaining pool of cells following space relevant exposures. Collectively, these results suggest unique cytokine signatures are produced following different simulated deep space exposures.\n\nCytokine Profiles Are Distinct following Simulated Deep Space Exposures\n\n(A E) (A) Heatmap generated log fold change quantitative PCR transcript values for the cytokinesIfn gamma,Il 4,Il 1beta,Tnf ,iNOS,Il 6, andIl 10. Bar charts are shown for cytokines, includingIl 1beta(B), Il 6(C), Ifn  (D), andIl 4(E) using relative fold change (RFC) andGapdhas the normalization gene.Figures 6B 6E bar graph data represents means+/  SEM (p< 0.05, n= 4 10 per group). Statistical tests and labels are the same asFigure1.\n\nmiRNAs are non coding RNA interference molecules involved in silencing post transcriptional gene expression (O'Brien etal., 2018). Due to their important role in gene expression regulation (O'Brien etal., 2018), contribution to immunity (Tsitsiou and Lindsay, 2009), and importance for therapeutic purposes (van Rooij and Kauppinen, 2014), we sought to assess the circulating miRNA profile expressed in the plasma following simulated deep space exposures. We focused on miRNAs in plasma, as we have demonstrated that the immune system dysregulation is systemic and circulating (Beheshti etal., 2017,2018,2019;Mehta and Baltimore, 2016;Montagner etal., 2013;Schwarzenbach and Gahan, 2019). To determine the overall impact that miRNAs have on the immune system, we first predicted gene ontology (GO) terms with an false discovery rate< 0.05 from processed miRNA sequenced plasma data for all conditions and filtered for specific immune GO terms (Figure7). The GO immune terms were categorized by utilizing the GO Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) information for specific GO immune terms (Smith and Eppig, 2009). An Upset plot (FigureS2) shows general up and down immune pathways in each listed condition and the overlapping pathways between conditions. Overall, majority of the immune pathways are downregulated. Pathways related to humoral immune responses were the exception and predicted to be upregulated due to miRNAs, as miRNAs in general can elevate humoral immunity (Danger etal., 2014;O'Connell etal., 2010). A more detailed analysis of the specific GO immune terms (Figure7A) revealed specific pathways clustering together following specific irradiation exposures. We confirmed this pattern of immune dysregulation in deep space exposure groups in Hallmark pathways/gene sets (Liberzon etal., 2015) regulated by miRNAs, which showed distinct patterns within each group (Figure7B). Collectively, these results confirmed that distinct immunogenic impairment following simulated deep space exposures may be regulated by circulating factors, specifically miRNAs.\n\nGene Ontology (GO) Analyses of miRNA Terms Display Select Exposures Caused Differential Immunogenic Responses\n\nGO terms with a false discovery rate <0.05 cutoff were considered significant. Specific immune related GO terms were mapped to the GO Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) and were plotted with R packages. Biological and molecular immune pathways engaged following ionizing irradiation exposures, singly or in combination with HU.\n\n(A) Heatmap comparison of GO terms determined by expressed miRNAs.\n\n(B) Heatmap comparison of Hallmark terms determined by expressed miRNAs.\n\nCharacterization of biomarkers of inflammation during spaceflight is critical for understanding human adaptation to spaceflight. Although ionizing irradiation exposures in LEO are not at the same as doses experienced in deep space, health risks associated with these doses are still considerable, and career limiting. To characterize inflammation experienced on orbit, we re purposed retrospective data from ISS crewmembers participating in three experiments: Nutritional Status Assessment (2006 2012), Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect Against Changes in Bone Metabolism During Space Flight and Recovery (Pro K) (2010 2015), and Biochemical Profile (2013 2018). Subsets of these data have been previously published (Crucian etal., 2014;Smith etal., 2015).\n\nPro inflammatory IL 1beta and IL 1alpha and pleiotropic insulin like growth factor (IGF) 1 and IL 1 receptor antagonist (RA) were analyzed. The results showed that IGF 1 was induced at in flight day 15 and remained persistent through flight and during post flight return (Figure8andTable S1). Cytokines IL 1beta and IL 1alpha were also inconsistently elevated during flight, compared with preflight, whereas both returned to pre flight levels upon return to Earth, suggesting ground readaptation (Figure8). In addition, IL 1RA was also elevated in flight, and returned to pre flight baseline controls (L 45,Figure8), indicating homeostatic inhibition of IL 1alpha and/or IL 1beta may also be regulated in flight. As both pro inflammatory IL 1alpha and IL 1beta levels are elevated in flight, along with their inhibitor IL 1RA, it indicates that other factors involved in pro inflammatory cytokine expression supersede IL 1RA inhibition. These studies, and others (Buchheim etal., 2019;Garrett Bakelman etal., 2019), indicate that inflammation is induced in LEO, although mechanisms are also in place to maintain homeostasis, which may also apply during missions beyond LEO.\n\nElevated Markers of Inflammation in Astronauts on 4  to 6 Month ISS Missions\n\nBlood samples were collected at launch minus (L ) 45days, on Flight Day (FD)15, FD30, FD60, FD120, and FD180; post flight samples were collected in the first 24h after landing and again 30days later . Inflammatory markers were analyzed in plasma for IGF 1, IL 1beta, IL 1alpha, and IL 1RA. Repeated measures analysis of variance was conducted to test for differences during and after flight compared with preflight, and comparisons among time points were made using a Bonferroni t test. Multiple comparisons were accounted for. Data represent means+/  SEM (p< 0.001, n= 59 crewmembers; 47 males, 12 females). Subsets of these data have been previously published (Crucian etal., 2014;Smith etal., 2015).\n\nHerein, the results revealed that at 14days post HU and 1day post acute irradiation exposure, total body and immune organ (spleen and thymus) weights were reduced, which was accompanied by reduced total leukocytes in combination exposures, compared to NL Sham controls. Most strikingly, reduced frequency of T effector lymphocytes (i.e., T helper, Thand T cytotoxic, Tccells) and B lymphocytes in the presence of combined conditions, compared to NL Sham controls, were noted indicating the potential for impaired adaptive immunity. Furthermore, differential cytokine profiles were also characterized, which displayed the potential for Th2 lineages to develop, while Gene Ontology (GO) and Hallmark terms determined by circulating miRNAs displayed similar immune deviations in mice. Similarly, astronaut data revealed inflammation occurs in LEO missions, analogous to our ground based results in mice. Collectively, these results demonstrate that differential immune profiles are probable throughout the course of long duration, exploratory missions in deep space and describe circulating immune biomarkers (i.e., select cell types and miRNAs) as potential therapeutic targets to regulate immunity.",
    "discussion": "Utilizing the recently developed simplified version of the NASA consensus formula of five different ions to simulate GCR and SPE irradiation at NSRL, our study sought to investigate the immediate early immune effects following acute simulated deep space exposures of ionizing irradiation, singly or in combination with simulated microgravity in mice. We also sought to describe the contributing role of circulating miRNAs on the immune profile, as miRNAs have been identified as regulators of immunity (Baker etal., 2019;Danger etal., 2014;Mehta and Baltimore, 2016;Montagner etal., 2013;O'Brien etal., 2018;O'Connell etal., 2010;Tsitsiou and Lindsay, 2009). Known effects of ionizing irradiation can cause immunogenic responses (Baselet etal., 2019;Li etal., 2014;Teresa Pinto etal., 2016). Indeed, high LET irradiation causes more damaging tracks and elevates apoptosis, compared to low LET irradiation (Niemantsverdriet etal., 2012). Yet, comprehensive immune studies on the effects of acute high  and low LET irradiation are limited (Gridley and Pecaut, 2006). Therefore, characterizing immune profiles and circulating miRNAs following distinct ionizing irradiation types are essential for successful missions to the lunar surface and Mars.\n\nIn our study, both GCR and SPE irradiation exposures in the presence or absence of HU in mice caused a significant reduction in total leukocytes (Figures 1F, 1G, andS1), in particular Thand Tccells (Figures 4B 4E). Whole body weights were significantly reduced in GCR and SPE irradiation groups in combination with HU (Figure1B) along with reduced spleen weights in GCR and gamma irradiation (Figure1C), which may be due to reduced circulating leukocytes (Figures 1F and 1G andS1). Furthermore, reduced thymus weights in HU combination groups with SPE irradiation (Figure1D) implies reduced clonal diversity of lymphocytes during deep space exposures, which can affect adaptive immune responses against future challenges. In line with this, miRNA immune GO terms revealed reduced spleen and thymus development following all irradiation groups, further supporting that deep space exposures can impair immune organ development (Figure7A). Thus, two possible outcomes are postulated: (1) delayed lymphocyte proliferation or (2) elevated apoptosis of both dividing and non dividing cells. In addition, B cell differentiation and humoral immunity were also affected in GCR and SPE irradiation groups, compared with NL Sham controls (Figures 3B and 3C) that may be partially dependent on cytokine signals (Figure6) and Thcell populations (Figures 4B and 4D). Innate immune profiles were also differentially affected following distinct exposures, adding another layer of complexity to this model. Nonetheless, these results collectively indicate unique immunogenic profiles following different ionizing irradiation exposures, in the presence or absence of simulated microgravity that may be useful for future space bioscience studies to expand upon.\n\nAlong with different HU cage conditions/designs, head down tilt angles (degrees of cephalad fluid shifting) used to simulate microgravity may cause distinct immune results. For instance, Wei etal. reported reduced thymic and spleen weights are due to lymphocyte apoptosis induced through elevated stress responses and corticosterone production on day 10 of HU exposure (25 degrees 30 degrees head tilt angle) (Wei etal., 2003). However, Ferreira etal. showed no difference in body or adrenal weights following 14 or 28days (15 degrees head tilt angle) of HU (Ferreira et al., 2011). Furthermore, work by Tahimic etal. revealed spleen weights were reduced at 30days (30 degrees head tilt angle) of HU, which may have partially depended on the number of circulating Thcell populations (Tahimic etal., 2019). In our study, reduced thymus, but not spleen, weights were noted in HU Sham, compared with NL Sham controls (30 head tilt angle) (Figures 1C and 1D). Furthermore, there was no significant difference between Tcor Thpopulations following 14days of HU, compared with NL Sham controls (Figures 4B 4E), but there were significant reductions in total leukocyte populations (Figures 1F and 1G) and B cells (Figure3B). Therefore, reduced thymus weights in HU Sham compared to NL Sham controls may be due to overall reduced leukocyte populations. Inflammation following simulated microgravity has been recorded in multiple studies (Cavey etal., 2017;Li etal., 2015;Zhang etal., 2010,2014), with an associated mechanism of elevated neutrophil counts (Dumont etal., 2007,2008;Frenette etal., 2002;Tahimic etal., 2019) leading to uncontrolled musculoskeletal damage (Dumont etal., 2008;Frenette etal., 2002). In our study, there were elevated neutrophils (Figure2C), NLR (Figure5E), andIl 6(Figure6C) after 14days of HU, suggesting neutrophil persistence, as IL 6 protects neutrophils from apoptosis (Asensi etal., 2004). Certainly, inflammatory neutrophil persistence can be damaging if not adequately controlled (Mortaz etal., 2018). Therefore, these results indicate HU, dependent on cage conditions/designs, may promote inflammation.\n\nInnate immune populations were also evaluated. For one, SPE irradiation alone resulted in significant elevation of eosinophils (Figure2D) and NK/NKT cell (Figure3D) percentages, compared to NL Sham controls. Interestingly, ionizing irradiation can cause cardiovascular complications (Puukila etal., 2017), while elevated NK cells (Ong etal., 2017) and eosinophils (Sgula etal., 2015) can contribute to these pathologies. Gamma irradiation alone resulted in a significant elevation in monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, and NK/NKT cell percentages, compared with NL Sham controls (Figures 2B 2D andFigure3D), suggesting distinct immune profiles are generated between different ionizing irradiation types. Indeed, gamma irradiation had considerable effects on innate immune cell recruitment into blood circulation, compared with GCR and SPE irradiation, indicating different mechanisms of immunogenicity following irradiation damage, which may be a factor of the high dose of gamma irradiation. Indeed, overall cell numbers were reduced within all radiation exposures, compared to NL Sham controls, indicating the damaging effects of ionizing irradiation on the immune system (Figures 1F, 1G, andS1). However, for the purpose of establishing the RBE in this study, gamma was used at a higher dose to make comparisons between charged particles (GCR, SPE) and photons (gamma). In addition, there are qualitative differences between the biological effects of each, such that gamma irradiation serves as a useful high ionization control. Interestingly, all four innate populations studied are inflammation producing cells upon activation and were suppressed when gamma irradiation was combined with HU, indicating the potential for inhibited inflammation. Similar impairment was observed in SPE irradiation in combination with HU groups in terms of reduced eosinophil (Figure2D) and NK/NKT cell percentages (Figure3D). As such, a reduced number of select innate immune cells 24h following distinct irradiation treatments in combination with simulated microgravity, may be a result of impaired innate immune cell recruitment. In addition, miRNA immune GO term analyses indicated a general reduction in myeloid cell differentiation and FcR mediated signaling in all exposure groups, suggesting distinct biological pathways involved in phagocytosis (Koenderman, 2019) are suppressed during simulated deep space exposures (Figure7A). Collectively, impairment in both leukocyte recruitment and phagocytic function can result in inefficient innate responses against challenges, i.e., microbial or viral. In line with this, astronauts on board the ISS experience immune dysregulation and heightened infections (Cervantes and Hong, 2016;Crucian etal., 2015;Mehta etal., 2017;Nash, 2000), which may be a result of poor immunogenic innate immune responses and recruitment. However, furtherstudies with these distinct deep space relevant exposures, circulating miRNAs, and cell types are required.\n\nAside from elevatedIfn gammain GCR irradiation exposure groups, compared to NL Sham controls (Figure6D), GCR irradiation in combination with HU displayed reduced inflammation compared with GCR irradiation alone, as measured by the pro inflammatory cytokines,Il 1betaandIl 6. These results suggest simulated microgravity suppressed inflammation in combination with GCR irradiation (Figures 6B and 6C). Indeed, this may partially explain reduced B cell percentage in GCR irradiation with simulated microgravity (Figure3B), as IL 6 is a plasma cell differentiator that enhances humoral immunity (Dienz etal., 2009). Furthermore, IL 6 differentiates naive Tcells into T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, which drives B cell maturation into plasma cells (Crotty, 2014). IL 1beta has also recently been characterized to play an important role in Tfheffector cell development as well (Ritvo and Klatzmann, 2019). Therefore, reduced expression of both of these cytokines in combined GCR irradiation with HU may be indirectly linked to reduced B cell differentiation. In line with this, both GCR irradiation groups displayed a significant reduction in Thcells compared to NL Sham controls (Figures 4B and 4D). Although distinct effector Tcell profiles, including Tfh, were not thoroughly characterized, Tfheffector cell lineage would have been included in these overall Thcell populations. Additionally, CD20 surface molecule expression on B cells is reduced during B cell maturation into plasma cells (Robillard etal., 2014;Styles etal., 2017). However, we did not see any difference in cell surface expression of CD20 MFI (Figure3C), suggesting B cell differentiation into antibody secreting plasma cells may be impaired in GCR and SPE irradiation groups, compared to NL Sham controls. As B cell numbers are reduced (with no difference in CD20 surface expression) within GCR and SPE in combination with HU groups, there is a lower pool of antibody production vehicles essential for effective humoral immunity. miRNA GO immune terms displayed reduced B cell differentiation and homeostasis in SPE irradiation and gamma irradiation, compared with HU Sham controls, but was no different with GCR irradiation groups (Figure7A), further suggesting distinct immune related pathways are regulated following deep space simulations. Of interest, robust gene expression ofIl 4(Figure6E), which is produced by Th2 and Tfhcells, directly promotes B cell maturation to plasma cells and ultimately the release of antibodies. Therefore, although initial B cell populations are reduced, functional output may be compensated for via robust expression ofIl 4. LEO spaceflight missions have described minimal differences in B cell numbers and antibody production of IgG or IgM; however, IgA levels in flight were significantly upregulated compared with ground controls (Spielmann etal., 2019). This effect may be explained by the general effects of circulating miRNAs, as humoral immunity is predicted to be elevated by miRNAs (Danger etal., 2014;O'Connell etal., 2010). In our study, general upregulation of humoral responses are shown, yet multiple miRNA GO terms revealed that the humoral immune responses mediated by circulating Igs and B cells were suppressed with GCR combined with HU, compared to HU Sham controls, further supporting humoral immunity may be dysregulated following deep space simulations (Figure7A). Future studies addressing the level of Ig antibodies, B cell/plasma cell distribution, and circulating miRNAs involved during deep space missions would provide further insight into mechanisms involved in humoral immunity.\n\nA principal finding in our study was reduced expression of Thand Tccells, compared to NL Sham controls. As main components of the adaptive immune system, both Thand Tccells provide the advantage of immunological memory and assist with humoral immunity, which are important to prevent recurrent infections and tumor development. This becomes particularly important during long duration missions, where medial intervention is limited. Indeed, infectious agents such as herpes simplex virus reactivate during LEO spaceflight and are dependent on impaired cytotoxic Tcells (Mehta etal., 2017;Nash, 2000). Furthermore, previous reports have indicated ionizing irradiation activates Tcells (Schaue and McBride, 2012). However, the overall effect of ionizing irradiation on lymphocyte outcomes (i.e., activation or apoptosis) depends on multiple factors, most notably the dose and dose schedule (MacLennan and Kay, 1978;Schaue and McBride, 2012). For instance, preconditioning mice, i.e., irradiation for graft transplantation, relies on lethal bone marrow irradiation doses and fractionations to reduce lymphocyte counts (Bagley etal., 2002). In our study, GCR irradiation caused extensive reduction in both Thand Tccells, compared with SPE or gamma irradiation (Figures 4B 4E), indicating GCR irradiation produced more damaging effects on these cell types. Inhomogeneous dose depth between charged particles (GCR, SPE) and photon (gamma) tracks may be involved in this effect, as gamma irradiation exposure groups did not significantly affect Thor Tcnumbers, compared with SPE and GCR irradiation groups. Thus, GCR and SPE irradiation may target deeper immune tissues, such as lymph nodes, where the majority of T naive and circulating T effector cells reside when not trafficking in the bloodstream (Hunter etal., 2016). The radiosensitivity of lymphocytes is dependent on the speed of DNA repair mechanisms relative to division, as non proliferating cells are more radioresistant (Schaue and McBride, 2012). Radioresistance is observed in non dividing cells as these cells are in G0 stage, during which DNA is compact and stable, protein protected heterochromatin (Falk etal., 2008;Karagiannis etal., 2007). Proliferating lymphocytes, on the other hand, have exited the G0 stage and are in the DNA synthesis phase, which makes them more vulnerable to irradiation damage (Falk etal., 2008;Karagiannis etal., 2007). Cellular division requires correct, undamaged DNA to be copied to their progeny, and if repair mechanisms are not fast enough, elevated apoptosis results (Niemantsverdriet etal., 2012). Indeed, miRNA Hallmark terms for DNA repair are upregulated, indicating after exposure to deep space simulations, circulating miRNAs are involved in DNA repair machinery, whereby DNA damage has occurred (Figure7B). Although we did not measure apoptosis directly, miRNA Hallmark terms also identified select apoptosis pathways were engaged during GCR irradiation exposures, compared to HU Sham controls (Figure7B), suggesting elevated DNA damage may be beyond repair, leading to apoptosis, following GCR irradiation conditions.\n\nWe further assessed lymphocyte surface receptor expression of IL 7R. As described above, IL 7R is expressed on naive Tcells, but not activated Tcells, and then is re expressed on memory Tcells (Mazzucchelli and Durum, 2007). Indeed, IL 7R MFI was reduced in GCR irradiation combined with HU, compared to NL Sham controls, suggesting Tcell activation (Figure5C). In line with this,Il7Rknockout mice have significantly reduced developmental T and B cells, and are similar phenotypically as SCID mice, which are immunocompromised (Peschon etal., 1994). This may somewhat explain overall reduced lymphocyte populations following simulated spaceflight exposures, along with reduced thymic and splenic weights, as well. Interestingly, miR 199a and miR 142 3p targetIl7R(Luo and Fu, 2018), reducing its expression levels; however, in our report, mechanisms of this requires further investigation. Conversely, elevated IL 7R has been linked to multiple inflammatory diseases (Anderson etal., 2011;Belarif etal., 2018;Willis etal., 2012). For example, blocking IL 7R inhibited JAK/STAT, ERK, and PI3K signaling of IFN gamma from memory cytotoxic Tcells, limiting chronic inflammation (Belarif etal., 2018). In line with this, miRNA Hallmark terms displayed general reduction of PI3K/AKT signaling and inflammatory response pathways across all simulated deep space exposures, indicating miRNA involvement in suppression of these pathways (Figure7B). Alternatively, HU Sham groups had elevated IL 7R MFI, which suggests elevated inflammation. Indeed, miRNA Hallmark terms displayed elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) across all exposure groups, and HU Sham controls displayed heightened ROS expression levels (Figure7B). Heightened ROS can cause inflammation both in spaceflight and on Earth (Crucian etal., 2018;Garrett Bakelman etal., 2019;Nguyen etal., 2017), which may be an associated mechanism involved during heightened inflammation in the HU Sham groups. Therefore, IL 7R, along with neutrophil counts (Figure2C), NLR (Figure5E),Il 6expression (Figure6C), and ROS Hallmark terms regulated by miRNAs (Figure7B) are all elevated in HU Sham mice, further supporting inflammatory outcomes following prolonged microgravity. In line with this, ISS LEO crew member data displayed inflammation via elevated IL 1beta and IL 1alpha compared with pre flight controls (Figure8,Table S1). Importantly, these molecules were induced early (day 15) during spaceflight, whereby the effects of ionizing irradiation exposures would have been minimal (Figure8,Table S1), confirming inflammation is induced in LEO astronauts, similar to our ground HU model.\n\nLymphopenia, or reduced T and B cell counts, poses a problem for adequate immunological protection against challenges (Schaue and McBride, 2012). Furthermore, lymphopenia recovery results in immune profiling changes that may be either detrimental or helpful to the host. In this report, compared to NL Sham controls, robust induction ofIl 4following all ionizing irradiation groups combined with HU was noted. IL 4 is typically associated with Th2 effector cells, which are chiefly involved in allergic inflammation, including asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis, atopic dermatitis, and eosinophilic gastrointestinal inflammatory disease (Nakayama etal., 2017). Interestingly, during spaceflight astronauts experience elevated allergic like symptoms including rashes (Dunn et al., 2018) and hypersensitivity episodes (Voorhies etal., 2019). Therefore, Th2 immunity may be the principal immune response generated during deep space exposures; however, further evaluation of the type of Thcell subtypes produced in response to simulated deep space exposures are necessary.\n\nDeep spaceflight exposures present immunologically complicated outcomes. Synergistic inflammatory or immunogenic responses were variable in some, but not all, measurements, and in some cases were non productive. Furthermore, circulating miRNAs (cell to cell transfer via exosomes) (Montagner etal., 2013;Schwarzenbach and Gahan, 2019) contribute to unique immune profiles, therefore miRNAs may be important for immune targeted therapies. Although not studied in this report, added complexities involving combined types of ionizing irradiation, as well as protracted versus acute irradiation exposures that would also be experienced during deep spaceflight, are necessary to consider in future studies. Furthermore, only a small snippet into the immune response was assessed in this study; therefore, longitudinal responses and functional consequences are also required in future studies. Nonetheless, we found distinct immune profiles and miRNA signatures are produced by each irradiation exposure group, singly or in combination with HU in mice. Therefore, selective countermeasures targeting distinct immune responses in crew members may be required during long duration exploratory missions to the lunar surface and Mars.\n\nIn this study, we report the immune and miRNA differentials of mice following ground based simulations of deep spaceflight, along with analyses of crew member inflammation in LEO. As this study utilized ground based simulations in mice, deep spaceflight comparisons would be required to confirm similar profiles. Additionally, interpretation of whole blood transcriptomics to specific cell types is limited in this study; however, these data provide insight into the overall cytokine profile induced by each condition that is independent of cell frequency. Furthermore, the contribution of miRNAs to the generated immune populations is described; however, an understanding into mechanism and/or functional outcomes would fully elucidate their role to overall immunity. In addition, the time point of collections was at an immediate response, yet the long term response would also be of benefit, in particular, for long duration missions. Finally, the comparisons between the immune differentials in mice and humans is a limitation; however, this study can give some insight into the significant immune population changes (i.e., T cytotoxic lymphocytes) that can be studied in humans during deep spaceflight mission in the near future.\n\nFurther information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to the Lead Contact, Afshin Beheshti, PhD (afshin.beheshti@nasa.gov).\n\nThis study did not generate any unique reagents.\n\nThe plasma miRNA seq raw fastq files can be found on Database: NASA's GeneLab data repository/platform (https://genelab.nasa.gov/).
