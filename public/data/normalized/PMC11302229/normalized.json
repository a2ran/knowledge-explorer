    "abstract": "In the wild,C. elegansare emersed in environments teeming with a veritable menagerie of microorganisms. TheC. eleganscuticular surface serves as a barrier and first point of contact with their microbial environments. In this study, we identify microbes fromC. elegansnatural habitats that associate with its cuticle, constituting a simple \"skin microbiome.\" We rear our animals on a modified CeMbio, mCeMbio, a consortium of ecologically relevant microbes. We first combine standard microbiological methods with an adapted micro skin swabbing tool to describe the skin resident bacteria on theC. eleganssurface. Furthermore, we conduct 16S rRNA gene sequencing studies to identify relative shifts in the proportion of mCeMbio bacteria upon surface sterilization, implying distinct skin  and gut microbiomes. We find that some strains of bacteria, includingEnterobactersp. JUb101,are primarily found on the nematode skin, while others likeStenotrophomonas indicatrixJUb19 andOchrobactrum vermisMYb71 are predominantly found in the animal's gut. Finally, we show that this skin microbiome promotes host cuticle integrity in harsh environments. Together, we identify a skin microbiome for the well studied nematode model and propose its value in conferring host fitness advantages in naturalized contexts.\n\nThe genetic model organismC. eleganshas recently emerged as a tool for understanding host microbiome interactions. Nearly all of these studies either focus on pathogenic or gut resident microbes. Little is known about the existence of native, nonpathogenic skin microbes or their function. We demonstrate that members of a modifiedC. elegansmodel microbiome, mCeMbio, can adhere to the animal's cuticle and confer protection from noxious environments. We combine a novel micro swab tool, the first 16S microbial sequencing data from relatively unperturbedC. elegans, and physiological assays to demonstrate microbially mediated protection of the skin. This work serves as a foundation to explore wildC. elegansskin microbiomes and useC. elegansas a model for skin research.\n\nKEYWORDS:Caenorhabditis elegans, skin microbiota, microbiome, 16S RNA",
    "methods": "Strains were ordered from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center and include the following: wild type N2; CB130dpy 8 (e130); VC2985dpy 10 (gk3075) II; CB6627srf 3 (e2689) IV; CB6177bus 8 (e2883) X. All animals were grown at 20 degreesC under standard conditions to adulthood (52). NGM plates were seeded with eitherE. coliOP50 or mCeMbio strains, unless noted of a specific bacterium. For all experiments, L4 animals are placed on lawns and removed ~12 hours later, leaving only offspring behind. Experiments are then performed on the offspring, unless otherwise noted.\n\nIndividual isolates of \"CeMBio\" bacteria, referred to as mCeMbio (gift from H. Schulenberg, available now through CGC as CeMbio, see note below in Identification of mCeMbio) and CBX151 (a gift from Marie Anne Flix), were streaked onto LB agar plates, and individual colonies were picked and grown in LB growth media. Individual bacteria (12 mCeMbio strains, CBX151, and OP50) were allowed to grow for 2 4 days, with shaking at 4 x g at 20 degreesC. Bacteria were maintained and prepared to OD600= 0.2 by dilution in additional LB or centrifuging at 1,800 x g for 5 minutes to remove excess LB to increase the concentration of slow growing isolates. To make mCeMbio, each of the 12 bacteria were combined at equal ratios. Two hundred microliters of the bacteria was pipetted on 6 cm NGM plates and evenly spread across the agar plate using a sterile L spreader (VWR 490007 358). Bacterial plates were left to dry in a laminar flow hood for 2 days. If not used immediately, seeded plates were stored at 4 degreesC. We maintain glycerol stocks of each bacterium at  80 degreesC, and these were used for each new batch of each mCeMbio strain, OP50, or CBX151 bacteria.\n\nTheLelliottia amnigena,JUb66, genome sequenced in Houston by Buck Samuel's group and the JUb66 genome sequenced in Kiel by Heinrich Schulenburg's group are different. The bacterial sample deposited at the CGC as part of the CeMbio consortium is the JUb66 from the Samuel Lab (JUb66 Houston), and the one from the Schulenburg lab is now known as JUb101. We acquired our strains from the Schulenburg lab. These two genomes have identical 16S rRNA representative sequences and the same number of 16S repeats. A whole genome comparison of JUb66 Houston and JUb101 (formerly known as JUb66 Kiel) shows only 84% similarity. To determine the identity of our CeMbio strain, formerly known as JUb66 Kiel, we used the following PCR primers and standard NEB Taq protocols.\n\nJUb66 2270FTTGCTTCGGGTGGTGGTATCJUb66 2827RCCATGGAACTCACCCCTGTC\n\nJUb101 1377FGAGGATGGGTATGCAGACCGJUb101 2375RGGGATCGCAATCTGACGGAT\n\nTherefore, we call our mixture mCeMbio, a modified CeMbio consortium.\n\nAnimals were reared on mCeMbio bacterial lawns for 48 82 hours after hatching. Bacterial plates (n= 3 for each group) were flooded with M9 and 30 animals were picked off with a glass pipette and placed into an Eppendorf tube. For unbleached animals, tubes were washed with M9 +T [M9 +25 mM tetramisole hydrochloride (Sigma Aldrich L9756)] five times, allowing 4 minutes for animals to sink to the bottom of the tubes between each wash. For bleached animals, tubes were washed with M9 +T two times and then washed with surface sterilizing bleaching solution (M9 +T + 2.5% hypochlorite +1M KOH) for 4 minutes. These tubes were rinsed with M9 +T twice for 4 minutes each. After washes, animals were allowed to sink to the bottom of the tube. All but 100 uL of media was removed in the final wash, and the tubes were frozen on dry ice and stored at  80 degreesC. For \"lawn\" plates, 1 mL of M9 was added to the plate, and the bacterial lawns were scraped with a sterile L spreader (VWR 490007 358). Bacterial slurry was pipetted and centrifuged at 13,000 x g for 4 minutes. All but 100 uL was removed, and the pellet was frozen on dry ice and stored at  80 degreesC. DNA was extracted following the standard NucleoSpin Tissue Kit (Macherey Nagel 740952) protocol for animal tissue with 1 hour of incubation for the first lysis step. DNA was stored at  20 degreesC.\n\nFor each experiment, an amplicon library targeting the V4 V5 hypervariable region of the 16S gene was generated via one step PCR using the Azura TruFi DNA Polymerase PCR kit, and the 515 F (GTGYCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA) and 926R (CCGYCAATTYMTTTRAGTTT) primer set was used (53). Each reaction was performed with an initial denaturing step at 95 degreesC for 1 minute, followed by 30 cycles of 95 degreesC for 15 seconds, 56 degreesC for 15 seconds, and 72 degreesC for 30 seconds. Two and a half microliters of each PCR reaction was run on a 1.8% agarose gel to confirm amplification. PCR products were purified using Beckman Coulter AMPure XP following the standard 1 x PCR clean up protocol. PCR quantification was performed in duplicate using the Invitrogen Quant iT PicoGreen dsDNA Assay kit. Samples were then pooled in equal proportions (20 ng DNA per sample), followed by another AMPure XP PCR purification. The final libraries were evaluated on an Agilent 2200 TapeStation (D1000 ScreenTape), quantified with the Qubit HS dsDNA kit, and each library was sequenced at the University of California, San Diego IGM Genomics Center on a single Illumina MiSeq lane with a 25% PhiX spike in.\n\nAmplicons were analyzed with QIIME2 v2019.10 (54). Briefly, demultiplexed paired end reads were trimmed to remove adapter and primer sequences with cutadapt (55). Trimmed reads were then denoised with DADA2 to produce amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) (56). Taxonomic annotation of ASVs was conducted with the q2 feature classifier classify sklearn nave bayes classifier (57,58), both the genome derived reference 16S sequences of CeMbio strains (33) and the SILVA database (v138) (59). ASVs were then aggregated by the bacterial strain, and reads were normalized by the 16S gene copy numbers estimated by their genome assemblies (33). Bray Curtis dissimilarities, Shannon indices, and tests of statistical significance were then calculated with the QIIME2 diversity plugin on the normalized relative abundance count data (60,61). Raw sequence data are deposited in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under the BioProject accessionPRJNA979901. Data are sorted into experiment 1 and experiment 2 \"combine,\" in which all wild type, hermaphrodite samples, regardless of date of extraction or age, were included if they met the category \"bleached\" or \"unbleached\" (serially washed). These data are displayed inFig. 2and sorted by experiment. Fig. S2 displays data from combining experiment 1 and experiment 2, but only the samples in which the bleached and unbleached (serially washed) samples were prepared as a matched set on the same day and at day 1 of adulthood.\n\nTo prepare the micro swab, a glass capillary tube (World Precision Instrument Thin Wall Glass Capillaries TW100 4 or similar) was pulled apart over a small flame into two pieces. Heat was used to create a small closed bulb at the pulled end of each piece, ensuring there were no crevices in which bacteria or liquids may accumulate, and then the glass was allowed to cool. Then, using 600 grain sandpaper, the bulb was lightly scored to make a textured surface (~10 small circles on each side and tip). To sterilize, the swab is dipped in 70% ethanol and air dried.\n\nTo swab a lawn, the micro swab is dipped into the lawn on which the animals were reared and then immediately swirled in the appropriate LB containing wells. To swab an animal with the condition \"crawl,\" a single animal is placed on an empty NGM agar plate using an eyelash pick and allowed to crawl for 30 seconds. Using a dissecting microscope, the animal was gently swabbed using the bulbous end from head to tail 10 times. The bulb was then dipped and swirled around in 10 circles into 200 uL of LB in a 96 well plate (CoStar 96 Flat Black). Animals that were washed once \"1 x wash\" were washed in M9 +T and allowed to sink to the bottom of a tube. This was repeated two more times for \"3 x wash.\" For animals in the \"bleach\" group, they were first washed with M9 +T three times, then once with surface sterilizing bleaching solution (M9 +T + 2.5% hypochlorite +1M KOH), and once more with M9 +T. Once washed or bleached, the animals were then pipetted onto a sterile NGM plate in a small volume and allowed to crawl out of the drop before being swabbed. Once all animals were swabbed, the OD600was measured using a Molecular Devices SpectraMaxPlus with absorbance = 600 nm, manually taking measurements during standard work hours. To generate the curves inFig. 1D, F and 3B, D and F,Fig. S1A through D and Fig. S3A through F, the individual replicate OD600values at each timepoint were averaged in each condition within an experiment. Our methods make use of area under the curve analyses, which can be used to compare and quantify data from multiple growth curves (62,63).\n\nAnimals were reared to day 1 of adulthood on chosen bacteria. Fifty adult worms were transferred to a 2 mL tube containing 100 uL M9 and 10 20 1 mm zirconium beads (Beadbug Z763780). Each tube of worms was washed three times for 3 minutes each with 750 uL M9 +tetramisole (25 mM), removing all but 100 uL liquid with a new pipette tip each time, allowing animals to sink to the bottom of the tube by gravity. We separated half of the tubes to be \"bleached\" groups, which are subjected to a 4 minute wash with surface sterilizing bleaching solution (M9 +T + 2.5% hypochlorite +1M KOH). Bleached animals are washed for 3 minutes x 2 using M9 T to remove the bleach. On the final wash, 100 uL of the supernatant from each bleached tube is removed. Unbleached samples are washed for 3 minutes x 2 using M9 T, and 100 uL of the supernatant is removed for each unbleached tube. Each sample is homogenized using a Fisher Mixer Mill at Level 4 for 30 seconds for four cycles, totaling 2 minutes of bead beating. The homogenate was then serially diluted (1 in 100, 1000, 10000, and 100000 for each tube of 50 worms) in M9. One hundred microliters of each dilution was plated and spread with a sterile L spreader on LB agar plates. The previously removed supernatants were also diluted in M9 and plated. Plates were dried and left to grow for 48 hours. Finally, bacterial colonies were counted to quantify the original bacterial colony counts in each sample (unbleached, bleached, and supernatant of both bleached and unbleached samples).\n\nFifteen microliters of strong bleach solution (1M KOH and ~5% hypochlorite) is pipetted onto a single day 1 adult animal after it has crawled on a clean NGM plate for ~10 seconds. Under a dissecting microscope, the time to burst open (cuticle loses integrity) is recorded.\n\nFig. 1, 3, 4; Fig. S1 to S4 and their statistical analyses were completed in GraphPad Prism. Ungrouped two samplet tests were used when determining the statistical significance during comparisons of two groups. With three groups and more, an ANOVA test was performed for determining significance values. When appropriate, corrections were performed for multiple comparisons or unequal variances. AnyPvalue smaller than 0.05 was considered significant. The statistical tests used inFig. 2are described under \"16S rRNA Amplicon Sequencing and Analysis.\"",
    "results": "We sought to directly identify the existence of a resident skin microbiome on theC. eleganscuticle. However, existing microbiological techniques on the nematode are designed to isolate the entirety of the animal's microbiota rather than skin microbes. We postulated that the entire microbiota consists of gut resident and surface resident microbes and that these parts can be separated with varying intensities of surface washing steps (Fig. 1A). For instance, surface sterilization, hereafter referred to as \"bleaching,\" removes all skin bacteria and isolates gut resident bacteria (Fig. 1A). Moreover, we hypothesize that animals with more skin resident bacteria will demonstrate larger decreases in bacterial counts following bleaching. Using a colony forming unit (CFU) assay, we assessed the existence of surface adherent microbes on animals reared on OP50 or mCeMbio. First, we observe greater CFUs from animals reared on mCeMbio compared to OP50 (Fig. 1B). We also observe no significant difference between the number of CFUs from whole animal lysates that were serially washed or bleached after being reared on OP50 (<103bacteria per worm,Fig. 1B). However, we observe a significant decrease in the number of CFUs from whole animals after bleaching (<104bacteria per worm) compared to serially washed animals (>106bacteria per worm). From these data, we find that animals reared on mCeMbio, but not OP50, harbor skin resident bacteria. Moreover, to account for free living bacteria that are not in contact with the skin, we analyzed the CFUs from supernatants after a series of washes. We observe that there are OP50 and mCeMbio bacteria present in the supernatant after washing three times, which might reflect transient gut or skin microbes that have been shed, and highlight the limited extent of these methods for identifying skin resident microbes.\n\nColony Forming Unit (CFU) analysis and novel skin swab protocols reveal that abundant bacteria persist on theC. eleganssurface (A) Diagram showing analysis of CFUs from washed animals, bleached animals, and liquid supernatants roughly estimates skin resident bacterial abundance.

This reusable glass tool is swabbed across the length of each animal (Fig. 1C). To eliminate non adherent, free living microbes and enrich for putative skin resident microbes, we compare unwashed animals (\"crawl\") to animals that have been washed once or three times. As a negative control, we include animals that have been bleached. Swabs from animals reared on OP50 indicate that OP50 grows from lawns and unwashed animals, but even washing once eliminates all skin associated OP50 bacteria (Fig. 1D; Fig. S1A and C). Specifically, growth curves of OP50 from singly (1X) and triply (3X) washed animals are indistinguishable from the swabs from bleached animals (Fig. 1E). Swabs from animals reared on mCeMbio indicate that viable bacteria can be isolated from lawns and unwashed animals as well as animals that have been washed up to three times (Fig. 1F; Fig. S1B and D). Growth curves of mCeMbio from animals washed up to three times had ~7 fold higher levels of bacteria compared to bleached animals (Fig. 1G). These findings suggest that there are significant populations of adherent mCeMbio bacteria on theC. eleganscuticle that are removed by standard bleach based surface sterilization protocols.\n\nWe sought to define the species of mCeMbio bacteria that reside on theC. eleganscuticle and determine whether they are distinct from the microbiota of the gut and the surrounding environment. We performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing on bleachedC. elegans, serially washedC. elegans, and their bacterial lawns. In two separate experiments, we discovered that the bacterial communities of bleached animals have a microbiota that is distinct from those of animals that have been serially washed. In bleached animals, we observed significantly higher levels ofStenotrophomonas indicatrixJUb19 andOchrobactrum vermisMYb71, while unbleached animals contain moreEnterobacter sp. JUb101 andSphingobacterium multivorumBIGb0170 (Fig. 2A through C). Despite significant differences between the relative abundance of bacteria across experiments 1 and 2 (Fig. S2A through C), we observe consistent differences in microbiota composition of bleached and serially washed animals, both of which are distinct from bacterial lawns (Fig. 2E and F). These data suggest that bacterial communities of bleached animals are significantly different than those of serially washed animals, as evidenced by Bray Curtis distances (PERMANOVA,Fig. 2G and I). Furthermore, within sample alpha diversity, expressed as the Shannon index, of each treatment group is similar, but mCeMbio bacterial lawns display greater diversity than bleached or serially washedC. elegansin experiment 2 (Fig. 2H and J). Our data suggest that the composition of theC. elegansskin microbiome is stable over time; we observe that only one bacterial species shows a significant change in abundance between 2 and 8 day old washed (unbleached) animals, while the microbiome composition between 2 and 8 day old bleached animals shows reduction in only two species (Fig. S2D and E). Collectively, we suggest that the microbiota ofC. eleganswith an intact skin microbiota is distinct from the microbiota of theC. elegansgut and further distinct from the environment on which the animals were raised. Specifically, we hypothesize that species more abundant in bleached animals (JUb19 and MYb71) are more gut specific, whereas species more abundant in serially washed animals (JUb101 and BIGb0170) are more skin specific.\n\nSurface sterilization alters the relative proportion of mCeMbio bacteria.

JUb101 is the only predominantly skin resident microbe on whichC. elegansdevelop at similar rates to those of OP50 and mCeMbio ((33) and our observations), and JUb19 is the gut resident microbe with the highest relative abundance (Fig. 2C and D).\n\nAs inFig. 1, we performed CFU analysis on the microbes of interest in this study. We observe more CFUs from lysates of serially washed animals reared on JUb101 (>106bacteria per worm) than lysates of serially washed animals reared on JUb19 (<105bacteria per worm) (Fig. 3A). There is no statistically significant difference between the number of CFUs from lysates of serially washed or bleached animals reared on JUb19, although JUb19 is still found on the surface. This is indicated by ~104CFU per worm found in and on serially washed animals, compared to the ~102CFU per worm found in bleached animals (Fig. 3A). Conversely, in animals raised on JUb101, there is a statistically significant decrease in the number of CFUs from whole animals after bleaching (~102bacteria per worm) compared to serially washed animals (>106bacteria per worm), indicating the presence of JUb101 as a persistent and abundant skin resident microbe that is removed with surface sterilization protocols, but not serial washes (Fig. 3A). To account for free living bacteria that are loosely attached to the cuticle or transient within the worm, we analyzed the CFUs from supernatants following serial washes. We observe that JUb101 and JUb19 are both present in these supernatants, but in lower abundance when compared to washed groups.\n\nJUb19 and JUb101 display variable strengths of cuticle attachment (A) Average colony forming units per worm in each sample type.

Error bars are SEM. *P< 0.05, **P< 0.05, ***P< 0.001, and ****P< 0.0001.\n\nTo directly compare JUb19 and JUb101 as putative gut and skin resident microbes, respectively, we swabbed animals reared on JUb19, JUb101, or CBX151. We include CBX151 (Leucobacter celersubsp.astrifaciens, Verde1) as a control bacterium that is known to strongly adhere to theC. eleganscuticle (44). We hypothesized that the patterns observed in the growth curves of swabbed skin resident bacteria should more closely resemble those of CBX151 and mCeMbio animals (Fig. 1G), whereas the patterns observed in the growth curves of swabbed gut resident bacteria should resemble those of OP50 (Fig. 1E). As expected, swabs from animals reared on CBX151 grow regardless of the number of washes (Fig. 3B). After 72 hours of growth, no discernable differences between swabs from animals that were unwashed (\"crawl\"), washed once, or washed thrice after exposure to CBX151 were observed (Fig. 3C; Fig. S3A and B). Similarly, swabs from animals reared on JUb101 grow regardless of the number of washes (Fig. 3D). After 72 hours of growth, swabs from JUb101 reared animals that have been washed once are not distinct from those of unwashed JUb101 reared animals, but are distinct from those of bleached animals (Fig. 3E; Fig. S3C and D). Conversely, swabs from animals reared on JUb19 indicate that bacterial growth from unwashed \"crawl\" animals is distinct from animals washed once or thrice (Fig. 3F and G). Swabs from JUb19 animals washed once or thrice are indistinguishable from swabs of bleached animals (Fig. 3G; Fig. S3E and F). Together, the patterns observed in JUb101 growth curves resemble those of CBX151, suggesting that JUb101 is also likely a cuticle resident microbe.\n\nGiven that mCeMbio contains both skin  and gut resident bacteria, with variable strengths of attachment on the nematode cuticle, we sought to observe a potential role for skin adherent bacteria. We hypothesized that bacteria associated with the cuticle (JUb101, BIGb0170, and CBX151 as a known skin adherent control) would protect animals from noxious environments more than gut associated ones (JUb19 and MYb71). To test this, we performed a cuticle resistance assay by treating animals with a harsh (5%) bleach solution (Fig. 4A). In this assay, the time to burst is a readout of cuticle integrity and a potential indication of the protective roles that bacteria may have on worm physiology (45,46). We found that wild type animals reared on CBX151 and mCeMbio community take significantly longer to burst compared to OP50 controls and therefore exhibit greater cuticle resistance (Fig. 4B). Animals were also reared on mCeMbio isolates individually, and we observed a range of impacts on cuticle integrity. Some bacterial species, including gut residentOchrobactrumMYb71, significantly promoted cuticle integrity with longer times to burst. Other bacteria, including the skin associated JUb101 and gut associated JUb19, did not alter animal burst times compared to OP50.SphingomonasJUb134 was the only mCeMbio strain to significantly decrease host cuticle integrity, further supporting that most mCeMbio strains are nonpathogenic in this context (33). However, neither JUb101 nor JUb19 consistently changeC. eleganscuticle burst time on their own (Fig. 4B). This suggests that interspecies interactions present in mCeMbio may promote cuticle protection or the N2 wildtypeC. elegansstrain lacks sensitivity in this assay and masks the subtle impact on the cuticle.\n\nCBX151, mCeMbio, and some individual species protect wild type and mutantC. elegansfrom harsh bleach solution (A) Schematic of the bleach sensitivity assay using harsh bleach solution.

We tested animals with mutations in cuticle related genes:bus 8, dpy 8, srf 3,anddpy 10(Fig. S4A; Table S1). All genes are known to affect cuticle integrity.Bus 8is predicted to encode a glycosyltransferase, enabling proper cuticle molts and leading to disordered epidermal morphogenesis in strong mutants (26,45).Dpy 8anddpy 10are collagen genes that, upon disruption, cause loss of cuticular annuli structures (27).Srf 3encodes a nucleotide sugar transporter, and mutants have altered cuticle surface compositions that confer biofilm resistance (28). Previous studies have demonstratedbus 8 (e2698) mutants as more sensitive (45) in the cuticle resistance assay, whiledpy 10mutants have been shown to be more stiff than wild type animals (47) and express the innate immune genenlp 29at high levels constitutively (48), while also being more permeable to a Hoescht staining protocol (27), suggesting a multifaceted role fordpy 10in protection and permeability. Cuticle burst times of OP50 rearedbus 8mutants are significantly shorter (time to burst = 25 seconds) than of N2 animals (time to burst = 93 seconds), as previously observed in literature (45) (Fig. 4C and D; Fig. S4A). Despite a disordered epidermal morphology and disrupted cuticle integrity inbus 8animals, mCeMbio consistently promotes cuticle integrity (time to burst = 39 seconds) compared to OP50 (time to burst = 25 seconds) (Fig. 4D). To normalize across multiple experiments and variable times to burst, we evaluated the fold change in burst time compared to animals raised on OP50. We observed significant differences in the fold change in burst time ofbus 8animals raised on mCeMbio and JUb19 compared to animals raised on OP50, with mCeMbio providing 1.4 fold increases in burst time and JUb19 providing a 1.3 fold increase; JUb101 does not significantly increase the fold change in burst time but shows variability between experiments (Fig. S4B through D). Interestingly, the cuticle adherent CBX151 caused either parental death or suppressed growth inbus 8animals, preventing us from testing this condition consistently in this cuticle mutant background. Cuticle burst times of OP50 reareddpy 10mutants are significantly longer (time to burst = 145 seconds) than of N2 animals (time to burst = 93 seconds) (Fig. 4C and E).Dpy 10animals raised on CBX151 (time to burst = 457 seconds), mCeMbio (time to burst = 302 seconds), JUb19 (time to burst = 219 seconds), or JUb101 (time to burst = 291 seconds) display noticeably longer cuticle burst times compared todpy 10animals raised on OP50 (time to burst = 145 seconds) (Fig. 4E). This relationship is consistent with the fold change over OP50 observed for animals raised on CBX151 (3.9 fold), mCeMbio (2.3 fold), JUb19 (1.9 fold), and JUb101 (2.2 fold) (Fig. S4D). Given the consistency of increased cuticle integrity in both wild type and cuticle mutants reared on mCeMbio compared to OP50, bacteria bacteria interactions likely impactC. elegansbleach sensitivity. Moreover,dpy 10mutants reared on JUb101 or JUb19 promote cuticle protection compared to OP50, unmasking a subtle yet consistent impact of these bacteria on the cuticle. Despite being a single species, CBX151 is also a consistent promoter of cuticle integrity, suggesting a role for adherence to cuticle structures still present ondpy 10andbus 8mutants.\n\nInterestingly, these cuticle structures may be critical for the adherence of some of the mCeMbio strains. We performed 16S sequencing on these sensitized strains to observe the composition of mCeMbio species present on the surfaces of theC. elegansmutants. We show the composition of serially washed (unbleached)bus 8, dpy 10,dpy 8, andsrf 3mutants compared to wild type controls collected alongside them. We observe thatbus 8, dpy 10,dpy 8, andsrf 3mutants all display reduced abundance of JUb101, the candidate skin adherent bacterial species in this study (Fig. S4E and F). Moreover,bus 8, dpy 8, andsrf 3mutants have increased abundance of JUb19, the putative gut resident microbe in this study (Fig. S4E and F). These results allow us to begin to associate some cuticle structures with bacterial adherence.",
    "discussion": "Bacteria host interactions are complex and known to impact many aspects of host biology. Consequently, the study of ecologically relevant bacterial communities is often traded for the simplicity of single species. In this study, we demonstrate the importance of ecologically relevant communities of bacteria and uncover aC. elegansskin resident microbiome. We reared animals on a naturalC. elegansmicrobiota, mCeMbio, and discovered that most of the mCeMbio bacteria can be removed by bleaching protocols, suggesting that these bacteria may reside on the cuticle surface (Fig. 1A and B). We observed that our surface sterilized worm CFU counts match those in previous findings (33), whereas serially washed, unbleached worms have significantly more bacteria (Fig. 1B and 3A). We conjectured that there are abundant skin resident bacteria, approximating counts from simplified arithmetic of [# unbleached CFU]   [# bleached CFU]   [# supernatant CFU] (Fig. 1A). To supplement this finding, we developed and implemented a novel micro swab to isolate skin microbes fromC. eleganscuticles. We measured the growth of swabbed OP50 and mCeMbio bacteria fromC. eleganscuticles and observed distinct and repeatable patterns of relative growth between washing conditions (Fig. 1D through G); more washes are required to remove mCeMbio bacteria from the cuticle, implying that mCeMbio contains surface adherent bacteria.\n\nWe then conducted 16S rRNA gene sequencing to define strain level microbial differences among serially washed and bleached animals. From these data emerged candidate gut  (StenotrophomonasJUb19 andOchrobactrumMYb71) and skin dominant bacteria (EnterobacterJUb101 andSphingobacteriumBIGb0170). Although our two independent sequencing experiments revealed different proportions of microbes (Fig. S2A and C), both experiments suggest that there are distinct communities in animals with intact microbiomes compared to those without surface microbes (Fig. 2C through J; Fig. S2B). Importantly, the microbiomes from animals with cuticle adherent microbes are distinct from those of their bacterial lawns (Fig. 2G and I), indicating some level of selection on the surface of the cuticle. Although we cannot confirm whether the composition of the supernatant from washed animals, which is composed of loosely attached bacteria, is similar to or distinct from the environment or animal surface, we focused on the more strongly attached bacteria. We further confirmed the persistence of skin resident microbes compared to more gut resident microbes by measuring bacterial growth from skin swabs of animals reared on these species (Fig. 3D through G). We hypothesize that multiple species within mCeMbio may also associate with theC. eleganscuticle to varying degrees.\n\nNone of the mCeMbio bacteria are known to be pathogenic, although the individual isolates demonstrate varying effects on host developmental rates (33). Given the symbiotic nature of these bacteria and our parallel lines of validation of surface adherent bacteria, we hypothesized that the mCeMbio community serves a role in cuticle protection against environmental stressors. We conducted a well established cuticle fragility assay and observed the consistent role of mCeMbio and CBX151, a known cuticle adherent bacterium, to promote cuticle integrity in the host, which varies across the individual bacterial species in mCeMbio (Fig. 4A and B). From these data, we demonstrate the importance of studying community effects and the effects of single bacterial species on cuticle integrity. Put together, we uncover a protective effect for animals reared on a consortium of ecologically relevant bacteria.\n\nThe data from our study do not differentiate between the combinatorial effects of the mCeMbio bacteria on the skin and in the gut, and the mechanism of this protection requires further examination. Several species of bacteria found in association withC. elegansare known to, directly and indirectly, protect against pathogens in the worm intestine (49). Other protective benefits may be derived from diverse nutritional or metabolic mechanisms unique to the mCeMbio bacteria (33). This may provide an indirect mechanism by which gut dominant bacteria, like MYb71, are able to protect the cuticle. Moreover, both known skin resident bacteria and members of the mCeMbio consortium have been shown to prime the cuticle against other infections (50). This protection may even be attributed to the potential hydrogen peroxide degrading capabilities of the mCeMbio consortium, which have been observed in strains ofE. coli(51). Importantly, we sought to examine skin enriched microbes and the mCeMbio consortium as a whole, which involves both bacteria bacteria and host bacteria interactions. This is highlighted by greater cuticle resistance in animals raised on the mCeMbio community (time to burst = 277 seconds) compared to all but one of the individual mCeMbio members, the gut enriched strainOchrobactrumMYb71 (Fig. 4B). This suggests that most single host bacteria interactions may not fully recapitulate the extent of interactions in our system and demonstrates the importance of studying communities of ecologically relevant microbes.\n\nIn an effort to developC. elegansas a model for understanding skin and associated diseases, we must make use of sensitized and protective strains. To do this, we usedC. elegansmutants with varying levels of disordered cuticle structure and function. We found that mCeMbio, JUb19, JUb101, as well as the known skin adherent microbe CBX151 increase protection in nearly all sensitized and protective mutants (Fig. 4C through E; Fig. S4A through D;Table 2). However, we have not confirmed that these mutant animals can be vessels for bacterial growth on their skin, given their disrupted state. We see effects on these sensitized mutants and correlate those effects to the presence of skin microbes. It is also plausible that, similar to our findings in wild type animals, these effects could be due to nutritional supplementation from mCeMbio bacteria or otherwise mediated through the gut.\n\nAll cuticle burst timesa\n\nAverage time to cuticle burst for nine animals from each genotype (N2,bus 8,anddpy 10) raised on OP50, CBX151, mCeMbio, JUb19, or JUb101. Set 1 is shown inFig. 4C through E. All data are shown in Fig. S4 B through D.\n\nNA, Not available because that group was not tested in that individual experiment.\n\nInterestingly, the washed (unbleached)C. eleganswith mutations in cuticle genes display 16S profiles different from those of the washed (unbleached) wild type animals. These differences are most starkly observed in the decreased abundance of putative skin adherent microbe, JUb101, and increased presence of JUb19 across nearly all of the sensitized cuticle mutant strains. We do not have data for bleached cuticle mutant strains; due to their sensitized nature, the standard bleaching protocol was too harsh for most of the animals. Therefore, we are unable to compare between washed and bleached conditions. However, we observe that mCeMbio is able to rescue the cuticle mutants, which suggests that even small populations of the strains are protective or that the protection comes from aforementioned indirect influences.\n\nGiven the symbiotic nature of the mCeMbio bacteria, which includes 11/12 published CeMbio strains; unique cuticle structures of the nematode skin such as the annuli, alae, or invagination sites; and community effects on promoting barrier function, our data support the existence of and role for a previously unappreciatedC. elegansskin microbiome. Our work supports the continued efforts to make the study ofC. elegansmore ecologically relevant and suggests that we continue to understand and increase environmental enrichment to improve the relevance of this model system.",
