    "abstract": "The International Space Station (ISS) stands as a testament to human achievement in space exploration. Despite its highly controlled environment, characterised by microgravity, increased CO2levels, and elevated solar radiation, microorganisms occupy a unique niche. These microbial inhabitants play a significant role in influencing the health and well being of astronauts on board. One microorganism of particular interest in our study isEnterobacterbugandensis, primarily found in clinical specimens including the human gastrointestinal tract, and also reported to possess pathogenic traits, leading to a plethora of infections.\n\nDistinct from their Earth counterparts, ISSE.bugandensisstrains have exhibited resistance mechanisms that categorise them within the ESKAPE pathogen group, a collection of pathogens recognised for their formidable resistance to antimicrobial treatments. During the 2 year Microbial Tracking1 mission, 13 strains of multidrug resistantE.bugandensiswere isolated from various locations within the ISS. We have carried out a comprehensive study to understand the genomic intricacies of ISS derivedE.bugandensisin comparison to terrestrial strains, with a keen focus on those associated with clinical infections. We unravel the evolutionary trajectories of pivotal genes, especially those contributing to functional adaptations and potential antimicrobial resistance. A hypothesis central to our study was that the singular nature of the stresses of the space environment, distinct from any on Earth, could be driving these genomic adaptations. Extending our investigation, we meticulously mapped the prevalence and distribution ofE.bugandensisacross the ISS over time. This temporal analysis provided insights into the persistence, succession, and potential patterns of colonisation ofE.bugandensisin space. Furthermore, by leveraging advanced analytical techniques, including metabolic modelling, we delved into the coexisting microbial communities alongsideE.bugandensisin the ISS across multiple missions and spatial locations. This exploration revealed intricate microbial interactions, offering a window into the microbial ecosystem dynamics within the ISS.\n\nOur comprehensive analysis illuminated not only the ways these interactions sculpt microbial diversity but also the factors that might contribute to the potential dominance and succession ofE.bugandensiswithin the ISS environment. The implications of these findings are twofold. Firstly, they shed light on microbial behaviour, adaptation, and evolution in extreme, isolated environments. Secondly, they underscore the need for robust preventive measures, ensuring the health and safety of astronauts by mitigating risks associated with potential pathogenic threats.\n\nDownload video stream.\n\nVideo Abstract\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s40168 024 01777 1.\n\nKeywords:Pangenome analysis,Enterobacterbugandensis, Metabolic modelling, ISS metagenomics",
    "methods": "In this study, we utilised publicly available annotated genomes ofE.bugandensis(NCBI taxonomic ID 881260) from the NCBI GenBank sequence database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/, accessed on July 17, 2023) using command line tools NCBI Entrez Direct (EDirect) and bit[56]. We downloaded 211 genomes, including 12 genomes of ISS strains and one MAG generated from the metagenome during the Microbial Tracking 1 mission. To identify the source of these isolates, we manually explored the NCBI BioSample database and classified them into four consistent categories Human, Non human/ Environmental, ISS, and Unknown isolates. To ensure taxonomic identification and relatedness of the genomes, we employed the FastANI v.1.33 tool to calculate pairwise ANI for each downloaded genome[57]. The reference strain used for ANI calculation was theE.bugandensistype strain EB 247T(NCBI assembly ID GCF_900324475.1, available athttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/SAMEA104711314/), which was originally isolated from the neonatal blood of a patient in Tanzania[14].\n\nWe used the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based command line tool, GToTree v.1.6.31[58], to construct the phylogenetic tree of theE.bugandensisgenomes. The tree was built at strain level using the single copy gene (SCG) set HMM ofGammaproteobacteriatargeting 172 marker genes. We subsequently employed interactive Tree Of Life (iTOL) v.6.7[59] for visualisation and annotation of the tree. We excluded strain e1342 (NCBI assembly ID GCF_900075565.1) from our further analyses, as it appeared as an outlier in the phylogenetic tree.\n\nFor the ISS strains and its close Earth bound isolates (as shown in Fig.2, we computed the SNPs through a core SNP set using Snippy v.4.6.0 (https://github.com/tseemann/snippy) by mapping assembled contigs to annotated type strain. Snippy uses Burrows Wheelers Aligner and SAMtools v.1.3.1 for alignment and FreeBayes to identify variants across the provided genomes. We further ran Gubbins v.3.2.1 for recombination removal and FastTree v.2.1.11 with the generalised time reversible (GTR) model for tree building on the output from Snippy to produce the phylogenetic tree shown in Supplementary Fig.1A.\n\nTo identify and annotate the ORFs in the genomes ofE.bugandensis, we utilised Prokka v.1.14.6, which employs Prodigal for gene prediction[60]. Prokka's standard automated pipeline annotated the genomes based on multiple reference databases. We employed the Python package cogclassifier v.1.0.5 (https://pypi.org/project/cogclassifier/) to identify and classify COGs (Clusters of Orthologous Genes) from the Prokka annotated genomes. We applied the graph based algorithm Panaroo v.1.3.2 in strict mode, employing specific parameters (including a sequence identity threshold of 0.7, a core genome sample threshold of 0.95, no paralog splitting, and the \"Clustal\" aligner) and constructed a pan genome[61]. Subsequently, we used IQTREE v.2.2.27 on the Panaroo core alignment output, with the GTR+G model in fast mode, to build an alternative phylogenetic tree[62]. For gene level genome wide association analysis, we employed Scoary v.1.6.16, using the gene presence absence matrix generated by Panaroo[63]. This analysis enabled us to identify associations between all genes in the accessory genome and the traits of interest.\n\nTo identify the presence of antibiotic resistance genes and markers in the isolated genomes and MAGs ofE.bugandensisfrom the ISS, we employed the Resistance Gene Identifier (RGI) v.6.0.2, a command line tool using the CARD (Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database) v.3.2.6[22]. Matches were restricted to \"Perfect\" and \"Strict\" matches only, ensuring high confidence in the identified antibiotic resistance genes and markers.\n\nWe downloaded the 42 paired end metagenomics reads of the environmental samples from ISS during the MT 1 mission from NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) with the project accession PRJNA438545[19]. The metadata for all the samples, including the run ID, sample size, and sample name, is available in Supplementary Table2. We used the MetaSUB Core Analysis Modular Pipeline (CAMP) (https://github.com/MetaSUB CAMP) to preprocess the samples and predict the taxonomic profiles of the metagenomic samples. Within the CAMP pipeline, the quality of the reads was assessed using FastQC v.0.12.0, following which low quality reads were filtered out using fastp v.0.22.0 and adapter sequences were removed using AdapterRemoval v.2.3.3. Subsequently, host reads were removed after aligning it to the human genome (GRCh38, without alternate contigs) using Bowtie2 v.2.4.5. Sequencing errors were corrected using Tadpole v.8.22.\n\nWe further employed the CAMP short read taxonomy pipeline to generate taxonomical classification and relative abundance data for all metagenomic samples with non human reads. The pipeline uses BBMask within BBMap v.35.85 to mask the metagenomes to prevent false positives in low complexity or highly conserved regions in bacterial genomes. We then ran Kraken2 v.2.1.2, with a read length cut off of 150, to classify reads and determine the closest matching species. We used Bracken v.2.7 on the output of Kraken2 to estimate the relative abundance of species in each sample.\n\nTo gain insights into the microbial interactions ofE.bugandensisin the ISS, our primary focus was on identifying the viable microbiome associated with this bacterium. To achieve this, we analysed samples treated exclusively with propidium monoazide (PMA), which retains only viable and intact cells. For our analysis, we specifically considered only those samples containingE.bugandensis. Additionally, we limited our study to bacteria that coexist withE.bugandensis, having a relative abundance of >1% among all bacteria present at the respective location.\n\nWe obtained representative genome sequences of the co existing bacteria from the GenBank sequence database. To construct the Genome scale metabolic models (GSMMs), these genomes were processed through KBase (https://www.kbase.us/). The bacterial genomes were initially annotated using the RASTtk toolkit v1.073[64]. Subsequently, the Build Metabolic Model v.2.0.0 app was used to reconstruct the models based on the ModelSEED pipeline[65]. Appropriate templates, such as Gram positive or Gram negative, were selected for the reconstruction process. We further gap filled the models using RefGlucoseMinimal medium from the KBase public media database, with a maximum uptake of Glucose to 10 mmol/gDW h. These resulting models were then utilised for both graph theoretic and constraint based analyses.\n\nWe simulated genome scale models using a comprehensive set of metabolites believed to be necessary for the growth of the microbial community aboard the ISS. This metabolite set combines the minimal medium of each metabolic model with essential cofactors and coenzymes, as reported previously[13]. To determine the minimal media for microbial communities, we employed the minimal_media_from_cobrapy function from MetQuest v.2.0, which ensures the necessary components for a minimum growth rate of 0.1 h 1of all members in the community[66].\n\nWe further used MetQuest v.2.0 for constructing bipartite graphs that represent the metabolic framework of microorganisms. These graphs represent the interplay of reactions within the microbial community and helped us identify active and stuck reactions for the given set of metabolites using a guided breadth first search approach. The extent of metabolic benefit for each pair in the community was measured using the Metabolic Support Index (MSI) according to the following equation:\n\nHere,nstuckAandnstuckA|ABare the numbers of stuck reactions in the wild type and pair wise community structures. The metabolic dependencies were quantified based on the number of stuck reactions that were relieved by the developed community networks.\n\nTo predict the nature of microbial interactions, we employed SteadyCom, an optimisation framework for rapid linear programming problem solving. This framework allowed us to estimate the biomass production rates of every microbial member in the community in a time averaged, steady state manner[24]. The pairwise effect of microbes in any given community was expressed through the equation:\n\nHere,vbio,Bandvbio,ABare the biomass production rate of the organism B (wild type) and the community (AB), respectively. For SteadyCom simulation, the same media as before was used, with a constrained uptake rate of  10 mmol/gDW h. We considered a significant change in growth when there was a 10% difference in the growth rate of an organism within the community compared to its individual growth rate. Based on the calculated values from the equation (i.e. the effect of A on B and the effect of B on A), we classified microbial interactions into six broad types: mutualism (+,+), parasitism (+, ), commensalism (+,0 or 0,+), amensalism ( ,0 or 0, ), competition ( , ), and neutral (0,0).",
    "results": "We obtained 211 assembled genomes, annotated asE.bugandensis, from the publicly available National Center for Biotechnology Information's (NCBI) GenBank sequence database[20]. Among these genomes, 12 were isolated from three different locations aboard the ISS during the first Flight of the MT 1 mission: four from the Air Control (AC) samples, one from the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED), and seven from the Waste and Hygiene Compartment (WHC). Additionally, one metagenome assembled genome (MAG) was recovered from the WHC samples. To ensure the taxonomic affiliation of these genomes, we calculated the average nucleotide identity (ANI) by comparing them to theE.bugandensistype strain EB 247T(= DSM 29888T)[14]. The ANI values of all 211 strains examined ranged from 97.74 to 100%, confirming their species level taxonomic affiliation (>95%)[21]. The genomes isolated from the ISS exhibited an average ANI of 98.61%. Furthermore, we observed thatE.bugandensiswas predominantly isolated from human hosts, accounting for approximately 81% of all isolates, followed by non human hosts/environmental sources (11%). Detailed information on the genomes, including their isolation sources, ANI, as well as other relevant aspects, are presented in Supplementary Table1.\n\nWe employed four different phylogeny construction methods, including single copy core gene based (n= 172 marker genes) and SNP based approaches and found that the ISS genomes formed a separate clade from strains present in other Earth environments and hosts (Figs.2and3, Supplementary Fig.1). Notably, one strain, AR1358 from Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Zhejiang, China, clustered closely with the ISS isolates across all trees. To investigate deeper into the ISS strains' placement, we compared them to theE.bugandensistype strain EB 247Tand closely related human isolate, AR1358, at the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and other mutational levels. The ISS isolates showed an average of 36,044 (s.d. = 24.04) SNPs compared to the type strain. We found that ISS strains had significantly more SNPs (Wilcoxon rank sum test,p value = 0.019) than the closely associated human isolates (strains in the right panel of Fig.2). A comparative analysis of ISS strains with the closest Earth strain, AR1358, revealed significant differences of 3238 SNPs, 14 indels, and 578 complex mutations on average. However, these genetic variations were evenly observed among the isolates. An SNP based tree showed the ISS isolates form a separate clade even from the closest Earth strain, indicating isolates from other sources (e.g. leaves, human urine, seawater) did not cluster with ISS strains in our SNP based analysis (Supplementary Fig.1). These results reveal thatE.bugandensisstrains from the ISS show notable genetic differences compared to their Earth counterparts. This prompted us to investigate deeper into the comparative genomics, antimicrobial traits, and functional features of ISS strains, especially in relation to other microorganisms they coexist with.\n\nPhylogenetic tree ofE.bugandensisconstructed using 172 marker genes ofGammaproteobacteriashowing the distinct clade of ISS isolates/MAG apart from the other Earth based isolation sources. The clade with 32 genomes, which includes 12 ISS isolates and one MAG, is highlighted in the right side panel\n\nHierarchical clustering visualisation depicting the functional profiles ofE.bugandensisbased on COG annotations. In this figure, columns represent COGs, and rows represent individual samples. The pointed yellow box indicates the COGs specifically present in the genomes of the ISS strains\n\nWe identified and annotated every open reading frame (ORFs, i.e. coding sequences of isolated genomes) in each of the 211 genomes/MAG. Our analysis yielded a total of 945,562 coding sequences (CDS) with 2660 distinct Clusters of Orthologous Gene (COG) annotations. Although the above mentioned phylogenetic analyses suggested genetic variations in theE.bugandensisstrains from the ISS, they did not clarify how these variations translate into functional changes. A comparative analysis of COGs across all 211 genomes revealed that the ISS genomes exhibited a relatively higher average gene count in categories such as amino acid transport and metabolism, mobilome (prophages and transposons), and transcription factors (Supplementary Table1). To better understand these COG patterns, we constructed a presence absence matrix for unique COGs across the genomes, followed by hierarchical clustering. This approach also identified a distinct clade formed by the ISS genomes, indicating not only genetic divergence but also functional distinctiveness compared to otherE.bugandensisstrains (Fig.3). We further identified 14 COGs exclusively present in the ISS genomes (100%) while being rarely detected in Earth genomes (<10%). These encompass a range of functions, including amino acid transport and metabolism (COG2423), cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis (COG0464, COG4678), mobilome elements (COG3335, COG3600, COG5545), transcription (COG0454, COG0864), and others with yet unknown or predicted functions.\n\nFor a comprehensive understanding, we constructed a pan genome comprising 13,936 gene clusters, including 3836 core and 10,100 accessory gene clusters across all isolatedE.bugandensisstrains (Supplementary Fig.2). The ISS genomes exhibited an average of 4568 genes, a significantly higher count than the average of 4416 genes found in the Earth genomes. Focusing on the additional genes, we similarly identified a distinct subset exclusively present in the ISS genomes (100% present in ISS genomes and <10% in Earth genomes). This subset comprised 82 non hypothetical genes, though annotations for these genes remained limited. This subset included genes such as alanine racemase, biosynthetic (alr), lysine/arginine/ornithine binding periplasmic protein (argT), fragments of the astCADBE operon, and others pivotal in amino acid transport and metabolism. Additionally, a prevalence of transcriptional regulator genes observed, including HTH type transcriptional repressors (comR,rspR,yahB,nimR,yhjB,yybR), transcriptional repressor PifC, and pentachlorophenol (PCP) degradation transcriptional activation protein. We also noticed the presence of essential elements such as the two component regulatory system BvgAS, known for its pivotal role in controlling the expression of virulence factors and genes crucial for bacterial adaptation and pathogenicity. Furthermore, stress associated genes like antitoxin components of the type II toxin antitoxin (TA) system (antitoxin HigA, antitoxin SocA, antitoxin ParD1, toxin ParE1) and SOS response systems (LexA repressor, ATP dependent zinc metalloprotease FtsH 4) were notable findings. Transporters also featured prominently in that gene set, encompassing histidine transport system permease proteins (hisM,hisP,hisQ), octopine transport system permease protein occM, inner membrane transport protein YdhP, and glutamine transport ATP binding protein GlnQ (glnQ).\n\nThese observations motivated a comprehensive gene level pan genome association study with the aim of unravelling the genes linked withE.bugandensisin the ISS. Effectively accounting for population stratification due to shared lineages, we performed genome wide associations among 4696 gene sequences, ranging from 5 to 100% occurrence across all genomes. Importantly, our study further underscored the significant association of previously identified genes, from the pan genome study, with ISS adaptation after adjustments for false discovery rates (pBH<0.001) (Supplementary Table1).\n\nIn theE.bugandensisgenomes collected from the ISS, we looked for antibiotic resistance genes using the CARD database[22] and calculated sequence identity with the reference databases (Supplementary Table1). We found that these genomes harbour resistance to 23 different multidrug classes, including cephalosporin, cephamycin, fluoroquinolone, and nitroimidazole antibiotics. Notably, a gene from the ACTbeta lactamase family (ACT 77) was present across all 13 genomes, exhibiting 99.48% sequence identity and 100% coverage. Additionally, we identified other MDR genes, such as cyclic AMP receptor protein (Crp), fosfomycin resistance gene (fosA2), and histone like protein H NS (H NS), showing sequence identities of 99.05%, 96.45%, and 95.59%, respectively. Further, a total of 35 antibiotic resistance ontologies (ARO) were predicted across almost all the ISSE.bugandensisgenomes.\n\nWe then looked into the mechanism of antibiotic resistance and identified four mechanisms: antibiotic target alteration, antibiotic efflux, reduced permeability to antibiotics, and antibiotic inactivation. Moreover, certain organisms utilised combinations of these mechanisms to gain resistance against the antibiotics. However, these genes and mechanisms are not exclusive to ISS strains and are found in other Earth species as well (Supplementary Fig.3). Since the ISS genomes are closely associated with the human isolates (Fig.2), these findings raise concerns about potential significant antibiotic resistance within the ISS environment.\n\nNext, we focused on investigating the potential succession ofE.bugandensisin the challenging environment of the ISS. To achieve this, we conducted a detailed analysis of metagenomic reads derived from 42 samples collected during the MT 1 mission and assessed the abundance ofE.bugandensisin the ISS (details in the \"Methods\" section). Further, we segregated the samples into two groups based on the samples treated with and without propidium monoazide (PMA). Our analysis revealed the evidence of potential succession ofE.bugandensisacross the environments within the ISS during multiple flights (Fig.4, Supplementary Fig.4). Being interested in understanding microbial interactions, we focused on the samples treated with PMA, to account only for viable and intact microorganisms[23]. During Flight1,E.bugandensisdemonstrated substantial abundance in four distinct locations (1, 2, 3, and 5). This prevalence underwent a reduction during the subsequent Flight2, with only two locations (3 and 5) displaying its presence. We further noticed a resurgence in the prevalence ofE.bugandensisduring the third flight, being present in all sampled locations. The highest abundance ofE.bugandensiswas observed in Location2 (forward side panel wall of the WHC) during Flight1 (relative abundance = 86.7%). However, the median of the absolute read counts forE.bugandensiswas less during Flight1 (1530) when compared to Flight2 (1698) and Flight3 (2673). Sampling at precise locations identified during Flight 1 facilitated continuity in the microbial monitoring carried out in Flights 2 and 3. This approach was instrumental in decoding the microbial succession patterns on the surfaces within the ISS. The emergence of novel microbial populations may correlate with the crew transition from Flight 2 to Flight 3. An earlier study by Checinska et al.had reported that no environmental parameters had been altered during the flights[1].\n\nMetagenomic analysis reveals the prevalence ofE.bugandensisand other Enterobacteriaceae within the ISS environment.AVariation in the abundance ofE.bugandensisis shown across flights and treatment categories (PMA vs. non PMA), aggregating all locations.BComparison betweenE.bugandensisreads (in blue) and other Enterobacteriaceae reads (in red) across distinct locations of ISS (with a confirmed presence ofE.bugandensis)\n\nMoving forward, we probed into the microbial communities coexisting withE.bugandensiswithin the ISS environments. We focused on bacteria that displayed a relative abundance of >1% alongsideE.bugandensisin the metagenomic samples. This analysis revealed several patterns in the microbial co occurring networks, as shown in Fig.5. During Flight1, we observed distinct microbial dominance among the four locations whereE.bugandensiswas prevalent. For instance, Location1 was characterised by a prevalence ofKlebsiella, Location3 byMethylobacterium, and Location5 byPantoea, whileE.bugandensisitself held dominance in Location2. However, during Flight2,E.bugandensispresence was limited to Locations 3 and 5. In Location3, we noticed an exciting abundance of Gram positive bacteria, includingCorynebacteriumsp. sy039,Cutibacterium acnes,Paenibacillus polymyxa,Staphylococcus epidermidis, andStreptococcussp. oral taxon 431. In contrast, Location5 was dominated by members of the Erwiniaceae family, such asErwiniaandPantoeaspecies. While the abundance profile ofE.bugandensisremained almost consistent across ISS flights, during Flight3,E.bugandensisshowed its adaptability, occupying nearly all ISS locations (Fig.4B). A family level diversity analysis highlighted the continued dominance of the Erwiniaceae family, particularly thePantoeagenus, in most locations (Supplementary Fig.4). Nevertheless, Location3 exhibited significant abundance of Staphylococcaceae. The details of absolute and relative abundances of organisms and their co presence network are provided in Supplementary Table2.\n\nThe panel illustrates the co presence networks ( n = 3) of microorganisms that inhabit locations with a relative abundance >1%. The hexagonal nodes represent ISS locations, while circular nodes symbolise the microorganisms. Microbial nodes are colour coded with grey, indicating microorganisms present in multiple locations. The size of the node corresponds to the number of locationsE.bugandensis)\n\nWe further investigated the metabolic interactions among these co occurring microorganisms ofE.bugandensis. For this, we constructed 47 genome scale metabolic models and simulated them on the described media (details in the \"Methods\" section). To evaluate the effect of the surrounding bacteria onE.bugandensismetabolism, we calculated the pairwise Metabolic Support Index (MSI) for 957 identified communities. MSI is a directional measure that indicates the gain in metabolic potential of a microorganism while in a community compared to its isolated state.\n\nIn our findings, we observed 645 nonzero MSI interactions ranging from 0.069 to 1.061%. Specifically focusing on the predicted interactions involvingE.bugandensis, we noticed that it can provide significant metabolic benefits to Gram positive microorganisms (Fig.6A). Notably,Staphylococcus saprophyticusfrom Flight1, Location1, received the highest MSI of 1.06% among others, followed closely byStaphylococcus hominis(0.96%) at Flight3, Location2, andStaphylococcus epidermidis(0.96%) during Flight2, Location3. Additionally, we observed a slight metabolic advantage for organisms from the Erwiniaceae family in their interactions withE.bugandensis. The genusMethylobacteriumreceived an average MSI of 0.11%. Furthermore,E.bugandensisdid not derive significant metabolic benefits (< 0.1%) from any coexisting organisms. This suggests thatE.bugandensispossibly maintains metabolic competitiveness within these communities.\n\nMicrobial interactions involvingE.bugandensisand other community members.AThe heatmap presents the span of pairwise Metabolic Support Indices (MSI) provided byE.bugandensis(left panel in blue) as well as MSI values received byE.bugandensis(right panel in orange) from the community members. These values are expressed as percentages.BThe network diagrams provide insight into the type of key interactions involvingE.bugandensisand specific coexisting microorganisms: (i)Pantoeaspecies, (ii)Methylobacteriumspecies, (iii)Klebsiellaspecies, and (iv) Gram positive species. The colour and direction of the arrowheads on the edges signify the type of observed interaction provided in the legend. The edge labels indicate the Flight Locationwhere the specific interaction type was observed. For clarity, the nodes representingE.bugandensishave been distinguished\n\nTo investigate the impact of the microbial community on microbial growth, we employed the constraint based method SteadyCom[24] to analyse the interactions betweenE.bugandensisand its coexisting microbiota. Based on the changes in growth rate as compared to wild type conditions, we classified the interactions into six types (described in the \"Methods\" section). Our analysis predicted a total of 947 pairwise interactions across seven locations during three flights of the MT 1 mission. Among these interactions, we observed a prevalence of \"negative\" interactions, such as parasitism (441) and amensalism (412), followed by 34 mutualistic, 31 competitive, 26 commensalistic, and three neutral interactions. Focusing onE.bugandensis, we explored 126 interactions with its coexisting microorganisms. Among these, 63 were parasitic, whereE.bugandensispredominantly acted as the parasitic organism while reaping benefits from other organisms. Additionally, we noted 45 amensalism, 12 mutualistic, four commensalistic, and two competitive interactions involvingE.bugandensis.\n\nNotably,Pantoeaspecies were prominent in interactions withE.bugandensisduring all three flights. WhilePantoeawas mainly present in Location5 during flights 1 and 2, it appeared in almost all ISS locations during Flight3.E.bugandensissignificantly reduced growth rates for severalPantoeastrains, includingPantoeaagglomerans,Pantoea alhagi,Pantoea dispersa625,Pantoea rwandensis,Pantoeasp. At 9b,Pantoeasp. CCBC3 3 1,Pantoeasp. PSNIH1,Pantoeasp. SO10,Pantoea stewartii, andPantoea vagans, suggesting its parasitic role. However, one exception wasPantoea ananatisPA13, which showed mutualism withE.bugandensis, leading to a significant growth advantage for both microorganisms (Fig.6B). Moreover, in the family Erwiniaceae, microorganisms likeErwinia gerundensis,Mixta calida, andMixta gaviniae, displayed parasitism, whileMixtatheicoladisplayed amensalistic interactions, favouring growth advantage forE.bugandensis.Escherichia colialso interacted amensalistically withE.bugandensisat Location1 during Flight1, leading to its significant growth reduction. Another group of pathogenic species,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Klebsiellaquasipneumoniae,Klebsiellasp. LY, andKlebsiella variicola, coexisted withE.bugandensisduring Flight1 and 3 in several locations.E.bugandensisexhibited amensalistic interactions withKlebsiellaspecies, leading to a negative growth rate forKlebsiella. Conversely,E.bugandensisdisplayed parasitism towardsK. aerogenes(Fig.6B).\n\nE.bugandensisalso displayed positive associations with certain Gram positive bacteria.Paenibacilluspolymyxa, present in Locations3 and 5 during Flight2, showed commensalism in the presence ofE.bugandensis, resulting in a growth advantage. Additionally,StaphylococcusepidermidisandStaphylococcussaprophyticusexhibited mutualism, whileStreptococcussp. oral taxon 431 displayed commensalism.E.bugandensisdemonstrated competitive interaction against closely associated species Enterobacteriaceae bacterium S05 and amensalisitic toEnterobactercloacaewith a negative effect onE.bugandensis.\n\nInterestingly, in Location3 of Flight1, we observed that severalMethylobacteriumspecies interacted withE.bugandensisin a parasitic manner. This facilitated an increased growth forMethylobacteriumand subsequently a decreased growth forE.bugandensis(Fig.5B).Methylobacterium phyllosphaeraehad the most significant effect from this interaction. However, a fewMethylobacteriumspecies, includingMethylobacteriumaquaticum,Methylobacterium brachiatum,Methylobacterium durans, andMethylobacterium mesophilicumSR1.6/6, showed commensalistic, mutualistic, mutualistic, and amensalism interactions, respectively. Detailed information on the nature of interactions for all pairs can be found in Supplementary Table3.",
    "discussion": "In this study, we discussed the adaptation of a multidrug resistant, nosocomial BSL 2 pathogen,E.bugandensis, in the unique built environment of the ISS, and its potential succession. Several studies have highlighted the prevalence of microorganisms on ISS surfaces associated with humans, including opportunistic pathogens and discussed the importance of studying them[1,3].E.bugandensis, which is also an opportunistic pathogen, was observed to be present in the ISS during the cataloguing of viable microbial communities[1,19]. Such organisms pose potential threats to astronauts on the ISS, though the exact mechanisms behind their behaviour in space remain unknown. The impact on astronaut health would likely depend on individual health status and how these microorganisms function in extreme space environments. Hence, it is crucial to explore genomic and metabolic studies to understand the functionality of these microorganisms and their potential implications for astronaut well being. While some attempts have been made to understand the effect of pathogens likeA. pittii[25] andK. pneumoniae[13,26] under stress conditions on the ISS, there is still much more to explore.\n\nIn this study, we have not limited our analyses to a mere comparison between Earth and ISS isolates ofE.bugandensis. Instead, we adopted a unique threefold approach to unravel the potential succession ofE.bugandensisin the ISS. Firstly, we conducted a comprehensive genome wide analysis to identify the genomic and functionality changes acquired byE.bugandensisduring its adaptation to the extreme space environment. Secondly, we quantified the abundance ofE.bugandensisin the ISS across multiple flights of the MT 1 mission. Additionally, we looked into the coexisting microbial population ofE.bugandensisthrough a detailed metagenomic analysis. Lastly, we elucidated the metabolic interactions of these organisms and how they contribute to shaping the community structure within the ISS. Through this multi faceted approach, we were able to explain the survival and dynamics ofE.bugandensisin the ISS environment.\n\nRecent studies have also indicated the potential role of increased amino acid biosynthesis in the successful colonisation of stressed environments by bacteria such asSalmonella, which is also from the Enterobacteriaceae family[27]. Another operon, astCADBE, known to be involved in arginine and ornithine transport and metabolism, was present in ISS strains and plays a significant role in virulence in enteric pathogens through arginine catabolism[28]. Furthermore, we identified the gene encoding alanine racemase, a key enzyme transforming L alanine to D alanine an essential step in cell wall biosynthesis. Under stress, this enzyme might play a pivotal role in bacterial adaptation and survival by facilitating D alanine production for cell wall repair and maintenance[29]. Moreover, the higher prevalence of genes in ISS genomes than their Earth counterparts strongly suggests that ISS strains were able to acquire essential accessory genes through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events. This hypothesis is further reinforced by the increased abundance of COGs related to mobilome elements (COG3335, COG3600, COG5545).\n\nFurther, our analysis revealed the presence of genes associated with SOS response systems, including the LexA repressor and ATP dependent zinc metalloprotease FtsH 4. LexA, notably prevalent in ISS but scarce in Earth strains (<10%), suggests potential selection pressure onE.bugandensis's DNA damage response, likely induced by the elevated radiation levels and other adversities experienced aboard the ISS. InE. coliand various bacteria, the LexA protein plays a pivotal role in regulating the SOS response to DNA damage, influencing cellular adaptation to stress[30]. We also noted the existence of toxin antitoxin systems (TAs), which are widely distributed among bacteria and play a critical role in the evolution and propagation of antibiotic resistance, such as the maintenance of multi resistant plasmids and the induction of persistence[31]. A subset of genes related to type II toxin antitoxin (TA) systems, including antitoxin components (HigA, SocA, ParD1) and toxin ParE1, participates in plasmid maintenance[32], stress response[33], and biofilm production[31], thereby enhancing bacterial resilience and virulence. Additionally, the presence of the BvgAS two component regulatory system, typically observed inBordetellaspecies, is of interest. This system, often referred to as the \"master virulence regulator\", controls the activation of virulence genes in variousBordetellaspecies through its components: the histidine kinase BvgS and the response regulator BvgA[34]. Our findings also highlighted the presence of Imm (Colicin E2 immunity protein), a crucial element providing immunity to colicin E2, which are antimicrobial proteins produced byE. coliunder stress conditions as a defence mechanism[35,36]. Through a comprehensive genome wide association study, we systematically assessed the identified genes from the pan genome for their potential links to observed phenotypic traits, considering population stratification. We identified certain genes from our study that are exclusively present in organisms associated with the ISS, but not in their terrestrial counterpart. These include inner membrane protein YbjJ inBacilluscereusfrom the ISS[37], transcriptional repressor LexA, and ATP dependent zinc metalloprotease FtsH 4 inAcinetobacterpittiifrom the ISS[25], as well as the bvgAS system inCupriavidusmetalliduransCH34, known for its resilience in harsh environments and also observed in the ISS[38]. These genes could potentially serve as valuable targets for therapeutics against pathogenic microorganisms in the unique environment of the ISS. This analysis demonstrated a distinct association of the identified genes with ISS isolates, further corroborating their relevance to the specific environmental conditions aboard the ISS.\n\nThe antimicrobial resistance profile is also of interest, mainly due to the fact that ISS strains exhibit distinct phenotypes compared to their Earth based counterparts yet display similar antimicrobial resistance signatures (Supplementary Fig.3). Moreover, Singh et al.[19] have indicated a significant increment in antimicrobial resistant genes during Flight3 compared to Flights 1 and 2, highlighting the potential persistence of opportunistic pathogens in Flight3 samples, which is also shown in our study. We have identified multiple MDR gene classes (14 in total) within the ISS strains. Among these, the presence of ACT (AmpC type cephalosporinase)beta lactamase genes is interesting. Although previous studies have reported the presence of blaCTX M 55, blaNDM 5, and blaIMI 1in the broaderE.bugandensispopulation[39], our analysis did not reveal these specific genes within the ISS strains. Additionally, we identified thevanGgene, typically associated with Vancomycin Resistance Locus primarily observed inEnterococcus faecalis[40]. Another finding was the presence of KpnEF, a cell envelope stress response regulon, and an SMR type efflux pump associated with broad spectrum antimicrobial resistance, commonly observed inK. pneumoniae[41]. Considering the close genetic proximity to Earth strains, especially hospital isolates like AR1358, these MDR genes and associated mechanisms raise concerns. These genetic elements are likely acquired byE.bugandensisthrough horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events, potentially contributing to their MDR capabilities.\n\nNext, we set out to estimate the abundance ofE.bugandensisin the ISS metagenomic samples. Our findings revealed thatE.bugandensisexhibits prevalence and varying relative abundance across different locations within the space station. There were no significant differences in the absolute abundance ofE.bugandensisbetween PMA  and non PMA treated samples, suggesting that the DNA retrieved from this opportunistic pathogen residing on ISS is viable and intact.E.bugandensiswas found to be persistent across the ARED (Location3) and the Zero G Stowage Rack (ZSR; Location5) throughout all three flights of the MT 1 mission (Fig.5). Despite its presence in all locations, the relative abundance ofE.bugandensiswas generally low, except for a substantial burden observed at Location2 during Flight1 (Supplementary Table2). These observations further motivated us to examine the associated microbiota co existing withE.bugandensison the ISS.\n\nOur analysis found thatE.bugandensiscoexists with a group ofPantoeaspecies at multiple locations across all flights, particularly in the ZSR (Location5). Although bothEnterobacterandPantoeabelong to the family Enterobacteriaceae, they exhibit high diversity[42] and have been reported to coexist in other environments, including hospital ICUs[43] and sugarcane tissues[44].E.bugandensisalso interacted with severalKlebsiellaspecies within the same family Enterobacteriaceae, mainly at the Cupola (Flight1) and ARED (Flight3).E.bugandensisis a common human commensal[45,46] but can act as an opportunistic pathogen, co infecting immunocompromised individuals (e.g. COVID infected patients)[47], and have the ability to transfer plasmids through HGT events[48,49]. Studies have also demonstrated the co presence ofEnterobacter,Klebsiella,Paenibacillus, andPantoeaas bacterial endophytes in cereals andEnterobactersp.,Mixtasp., andPantoeasp. in germinating seeds[50]. To further explore and quantify their interaction patterns, we employed two widely applied computational approaches: (i) graph theoretical approach to estimate metabolic dependencies and (ii) constraint based modelling to examine the nature of their interactions.\n\nOur study, while informative, does come with certain limitations. In our comprehensive genomic exploration ofE.bugandensis, we uncovered genes linked to the ISS environment. Firstly, the limited number ofE.bugandensisgenomes collected from the ISS, in comparison to Earth isolates, may impact the robustness of our genomic findings. One challenge we encountered was the presence of numerous genes with inadequate annotations, many of which were hypothetical proteins. A comparative study by Lobb et al.[48] reported that Prokka, a widely used annotation tool, demonstrated a mean proteome annotation coverage of 52 +/  9%. However, it is essential to note that Prokka's functional annotation parameters are stringent, relying solely on reference proteins with experimental evidence for functional assignments. Moreover, while our study strongly suggests adaptation and a \"potential\" succession ofE.bugandensisin the ISS environment, we acknowledge that true succession assessment would ideally involve techniques such as qPCR or ecological scale analyses. However, we strengthened our hypothesis for the likelihood of adaptation based on multiple converging analyses employing diverse approaches. Furthermore, the metabolic models we constructed are draft models generated from representative type strains of the organisms. Although we employed default gap filling options using ModelSEED, these models may still have gaps and could differ from the actual isolates. Despite these limitations, such automated reconstruction models are widely used for studying metabolic characteristics and predicting microbial interactions[51]. Also, our models were simulated under minimal medium conditions along with specific cofactors, thereby representing environmental communities with limited rich medium contents. Although some microbial interactions might remain stable in various nutrient rich settings, others may vary based on the distinct metabolic capacities of the interacting pairs.\n\nWhile exploring microbial interactions in extreme communities, we employed a graph based approach for exploring the metabolic dependencies among the members. Our findings suggested that Gram positive organisms (e.g.Staphylococcus) often rely on metabolic support from Gram negative counterparts such asEnterobacter,Pantoea, andKlebsiellagenera. Moreover, studies from the ISS surface microbiome of the US module as well as the Japan module have shown that microorganisms belonging to the family Staphylococcaceae and Enterobacteriaceae were the most dominant organisms on ISS surfaces[1,52]. Focusing onE.bugandensis, we observed that it receives limited metabolic support from coexisting microorganisms, suggesting its positioning as a higher level contributor within the community's food chain. In contrast, most community members appear to derive some form of metabolic support fromE.bugandensis, albeit nominal in most instances. This finding is consistent with recent research indicating the significance of Enterobacteriaceae in facilitating beneficial interactions among microorganisms, whereas families like Erwiniaceae and Staphylococcaceae contributed less to metabolic support[13]. However, these interactions provide a static snapshot of metabolic interaction potential and do not really capture the nature of interactions. Thus, we introduced a complementary constraint based method to predict the nature of interactions based on growth rates. This combined approach offers a more comprehensive view of microbial interactions. Our investigation extended to the specific impact ofE.bugandensison other microorganisms. We elucidated possible effects on plant associated microbes, such asPantoeaandMethylobacterium, suggesting a potential overlap in resource utilisation for growth (Fig.6B). The prevalence ofMethylobacteriumacross the ISS, known for its resilience in challenging environments, underscores its adaptability to extreme conditions from NASA spacecraft assembly clean rooms[53] to hospital intensive care units (ICUs)[54]. Additionally, our study highlighted the reciprocal influence betweenE.bugandensisandKlebsiellaspecies, suggesting a potential reduction in the growth rate forKlebsiella(Fig.6B). A recent study indicated the interaction betweenEnterobacterspecies and clinical isolates ofK.pneumoniaeand their implications for antibiotic resistance patterns[55]. This study also illustrated how the presence ofE.bugandensisinfluences Gram positive organisms (Fig.6B). Nevertheless, while our metabolic modelling approach predicts antagonistic and parasitic behaviours, further experimentation is required to validate these predictions against other opportunistic microbial pathogens.",
    "conclusion": "In this study, we presented a robust and comprehensive methodology to decipher the survival mechanisms of the clinically significant microorganism,E.bugandensis, within the challenging environment of the ISS. Through a synergistic integration of genomics, metagenomics, and metabolic modelling, we unravelled the potential strategies employed byE.bugandensisfor adaptation and persistence in the unique ISS ecosystem. Our approach holds promise for broader applications, especially in terrestrial controlled settings such as hospital ICUs and surgical theatres. Ultimately, our findings pave the way for a deeper understanding of microbial dynamics in extreme environments, laying a solid foundation for future hypotheses and expanding the horizons of microbial ecology research."
