    "abstract": "Water unavailability is an abiotic stress causing unfavourable conditions for life. Nevertheless, some animals evolved anhydrobiosis, a strategy allowing for the reversible organism dehydration and suspension of metabolism as a direct response to habitat desiccation. Anhydrobiotic animals undergo biochemical changes synthesizing bioprotectants to help combat desiccation stresses. One stress is the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this study, the eutardigradeParamacrobiotus spatialiswas used to investigate the occurrence of ROS associated with the desiccation process. We observed that the production of ROS significantly increases as a function of time spent in anhydrobiosis and represents a direct demonstration of oxidative stress in tardigrades. The degree of involvement of bioprotectants, including those combating ROS, in theP. spatialiswas evaluated by perturbing their gene functions using RNA interference and assessing the successful recovery of animals after desiccation/rehydration. Targeting the glutathione peroxidase gene compromised survival during drying and rehydration, providing evidence for the role of the gene in desiccation tolerance. Targeting genes encoding glutathione reductase and catalase indicated that these molecules play roles during rehydration. Our study also confirms the involvement of aquaporins 3 and 10 during rehydration. Therefore, desiccation tolerance depends on the synergistic action of many different molecules working together.\n\nSubject terms:Evolution, Zoology",
    "methods": "The eutardigradeParamacrobiotus spatialisGuidetti et al. 2019 was used as target species. Specimens were collected from hazel leaf litter at Formigine (80m a.s.l.; 44 degrees 34.253 N, 10 degrees 50.892 E, Modena, Northern Italy). Leaf litter was immersed in tap water and then animals were extracted from their substrate by means of sieves, picked up with a glass pipette under a stereomicroscope and stored in tap water and natural mineral water 1:1 (rearing water) at 16 degreesC for 24h before their use10,31.\n\nAnimals were desiccated using a climate chamber (CHL, Angelantoni Industrie, Milan, Italy) that allows to control air temperature and relative humidity (RH) of the air. Animals were placed on a blot filter paper with a drop of rearing water and kept at 18 degreesC and 80% RH for 4h, then to 50% RH for 4h, and finally at 20 degreesC and 0 3% RH overnight41. At the end of these steps, the tardigrade body has the typical compact tun shape structure of a desiccated/anhydrobiotic tardigrade (Fig.1d).\n\nTo rehydrate desiccated tardigrades, small amounts of rearing water were slowly added on each filter paper every 10min for a total of 60min, this rehydration step is here termed the \"rehydration process\". Rehydrated tardigrades were maintained at 16 degreesC and observed under a stereomicroscope. Coordinated and active movements of the body (locomotion performance) constituted the criterion to evaluate tardigrade motility (survival). Locomotion performance was evaluated right after the rehydration process (t0) and after 1h (t1) and 24h (t24) (see Altiero et al.34).\n\nThe production of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) was detected after specimens ofP. spatialiswere kept in a desiccated state for 1 and 20days (see above protocol) at 16 degreesC and 0 3% RH. In particular, ROS production was evaluated in coelomocytes (storage cells) 3 and 12h after the rehydration process. As control, specimens kept in rearing water were used.\n\nFor each experimental conditions and controls, 2 5 animals were used, and for each animal 6 45 singular storage cells randomly chosen were analysed (TableS1).\n\nThe fluorescent probe 2,7 dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH2 DA) diluted in methanol was used. It is the most common probe to detect overall level of intracellular ROS55,56. Preliminary tests evidenced that tardigrades survive when kept for 45min in methanol used for dilution (methanol: distilled water, 1:10).\n\nEach tardigrade was sonicated for 90s in rearing water to allow the entrance of the probe in the tardigrade, and then incubated in 1ml of 10uM DCFH2 DA in methanol for 45min at 20 degreesC in the dark. After these steps, each tardigrade was washed with rearing water, mounted on a slide with rearing water as mounting medium. Then, the animal was gently broken with a pressure on cover slip to obtain the release of isolated storage cells. Cells were observed using Leica TCS SP2AOBS spectral confocal scanner microscope mounted on a Leica DM IRE2inverted fluorescence microscope, with an Ar excitation laser (exc=488nm) for DCFH2 DA (em=543nm) available at Centro Interdipartimentale Grandi Strumenti (CIGS) of University of Modena and Reggio Emilia.\n\nThe ROS signal was measured quantifying the intensity of the fluorescence signal of each storage cell using the program ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). The fluorescence intensity of storage cells was standardised removing the storage cell size effect and the background signal.\n\nThe following formula was used:\n\nIntensity of the storage cell signal=total fluorescence intensity of storage cell [(x/y)z].\n\nIn which: x=mean of two areas of the fluorescence intensity, y = mean of two background areas, z = storage cell area.\n\nThe mean value of fluorescence intensity of all previously measured storage cells was considered for each experimental condition (TableS2).\n\nThe statistical comparisons of ROS signals among the different experimental groups and controls were evaluated through the analysis of variance (one way ANOVA) with a Tukey post hoc test, using the program SPSS 23 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL. USA).\n\nThe RNA interference technique was utilised to target eight tardigrade genes. The genesgpx,gr,gst,cat,sodandtps(encoding the enzymes glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glutathione transferase, catalase, superoxide dismutase, and trehalose 6 phosphate synthase, respectively), andaqp 3andaqp 10(encoding the membrane channel aquaporin proteins 3 and 10) were targeted in order to disrupt their function. To verify the involvement of these target genes in the desiccation tolerance ofP. spatialis,three groups of animals were used: 1. uninjected control animals (control 1); 2. control animals injected with RNase free water (control 2); 3. injected animals with the dsRNA of a target gene (experimental group). For each target gene, three replicates each of 10P. spatialisspecimens (experimental group) were used. Each animal was injected with the dsRNA of a single target gene at the concentration of 4ug/ul (see paragraph below). For both control groups, three replicates each of 10 animals were used.\n\nThe methodological steps applied to animals were: injection (except for control 1), desiccation, rehydration, and check of animal motility. The injection was performed following the protocol by Tenlen et al.57with slight modifications. In particular, injection needles were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries 1B100F 4 (Word Precision Instruments,Inc.) using a PC 10 Puller (Narishige). Injection slides were prepared as indicated by Tenlen et al.57. Injections of the animals were performed using an inverted microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE300) and a manual micromanipulator (Leitz Wetzlar) linked to a Hamilton Microliter syringe. Needle tips were broken by gently stroking the tips against the edge of a triangular coverslip piece to obtain an opening in the needle tip of 2 3um in diameter. The successful injection of dsRNA or RNAfree water into the body cavity of tardigrades was confirmed by the swelling of the body as indicated by Tenlen et al.57.\n\nAll injected tardigrades were transferred in rearing water and left overnight to allow the dsRNA to disrupt the gene function, as indicated by Boothby et al.24. Therefore, they were individually desiccated as described above, kept desiccated for 2days, and rehydrated using the protocol described above. Tardigrade motility was recorded using the criterion of locomotion performance, which was evaluated right after the rehydration process (t0) and after 1h (t1), 24h (t24) and 48h (t48).\n\nThe Kruskal Wallis test was applied to compare the percentage of motile tardigrades (with locomotion performance) injected with dsRNA with respect to those of controls 1 and 2 at t0, t1, t24and t48. Thetpsgene was chosen as a further control (Control 3) to exclude the possibility that the injection of large amount of dsRNA is harmful forP. spatialis, since animals targeted for this gene exhibited negligible effects on the motilities at every time of rehydration. The Kruskal Wallis test was applied to compare the motility percentages of tardigrades injected withtpsdsRNA with respect to those of animals injected with dsRNA of other target genes at t0, t1, t24and t48. The statistical analysis was performed with the program SPSS 23 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).\n\nThe transcriptome ofP. spatialis24,86was compared with the transcriptome of the eutardigradeHypsibius exemplarisGsiorek, Stec, Morek & Michalczyk, 201824and with sequences of the nematodeC. elegansMaupas, 190087contained in WormBase and GenBank. Obtained sequences were aligned using the program BLAST to design gene specific primers (TableS4). Genomic DNA was extracted from five specimens ofP. spatialisusing the Worm Lysis Buffer57. Gene specific primers (TableS4) were used to amplify the target sequence with these cycles: first denaturation step for 2min at 95 degreesC, at least 15 cycles with 30s at 95 degreesC, annealing at 70 degreesC for 1min with a decreasing rate of 1 degreesC/cycle until the melting temperature (Tm; TableS4) of the tested primers is reached, 2min at 72 degreesC, 30 cycles with 30s at 95 degreesC, annealing at Tmof the tested primers for 1min, and 2min at 72 degreesC, with a final elongation step at 72 degreesC for 5min. PCR products of each target gene were directly inserted into a plasmid vector (pCR  Blunt II TOPO vector) and cloned using the Zero Blunt TOPO PCR Cloning Kit (Thermo Fisher). The recombinant vector was then used to transform competent Mach1 T1Rcells ofEscherichia coli(Thermo Fisher). To verify if the target gene has been inserted in the vector, a PCR reaction was performed using the purified plasmid DNA as a template and gene specific primers, with this cycle: 30 cycles with denaturation at 95 degreesC for 30s, annealing at 53 degreesC for 30smin, and elongation at 72 degreesC for 1min, with a final elongation step at 72 degreesC for 5min. After successful control of the amplification, several clones were sequenced for each gene, using gene specific primers. After sequencing, the plasmid sequence was aligned with the target gene sequence using the program BLAST to check the real insertion of the target gene in the plasmid and the absence of introns in the sequence. New primers were designed by adding the sequence of promoter T7 (5 TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GG 3) to the 5 portion of each original gene specific primer sequence (TableS4) and they were used to synthesize dsRNA from theP. spatialisgenomic DNA, using the T7 RiboMAX Express RNAi System (Promega), following the manufacturer's protocol. Following ethanol precipitation, dsRNA of each target gene was resuspended in nuclease free water and was ready to be used in RNAi. The targeted genes and their sequence references are reported in TableS2. The list of targeted sequences is reported in the supplementary section.\n\nA protocol was designed to verify if RNAi led to a decrease of each target gene expression level. A new group of five specimens ofP. spatialiswere injected with each target gene specific dsRNA, then individually desiccated, and rehydrated following the protocols described above. At t0(after the rehydration process), total RNA was extracted from each animal using the MasterPure Kit (Epicentre), and then used to synthesise cDNA using the SuperScript III First Strand Synthesis System for RT PCR (Thermo Fisher), following the manufacturer's protocol. Then, each target gene was amplified using the specific primers designed onP. spatialistranscriptome (TableS4) and applying the same thermal cycling conditions described above. As a PCR control, the same RNA extracted from each individual tardigrade was used to amplify the DNA polymerase II, which was used as control gene (accession number: GFGY01000030; position: 7492 7959; length: 468bp; targeted sequence in supplementary section). For this gene, specific designed primers (F  5 GTC ACG GAC GAA GGA GAA TTT A 3; R  5 ACG TGA AGA TGG GCG TAT TG 3) were used.",
    "results": "The overall level of intracellular Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) was assessed using the fluorescent probe 2,7 dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH2 DA)55,56. The ROS production in anhydrobiosis was determined measuring the intensity of the fluorescent signal emitted by storage cells of the desiccation tolerant tardigradeP. spatialis. Storage cells are particularly useful as they are numerous as well as the only cell type within the tardigrade body cavity. Storage cells are also easy to obtain and manipulate, whereas other tissues in tardigrades are more difficult to obtain and work with (Fig.1c,d). Figure2shows the fluorescence signals detected respectively 3h and 12h after the rehydration process in tardigrade storage cells previously kept in a desiccated state for 1day and 20days, and in the animals kept in a hydrated state as control.\n\nStatistical comparisons (one way ANOVA, Tukey post hoc test) among fluorescence signals emitted by the storage cells ofParamacrobiotus spatialisat different experimental conditions.\n\nThe total number (n) of measured cells is: Control, n=138; D 1 R 3, n=46; D 1 R 12, n=78; D 20 R 3, n=78; D 20 R 12, n=36 (see TableS1).\n\nD 1=animals kept in a desiccated state for 1day, D 20=animals kept in a desiccated state for 20days, R 3=3h after the rehydration process, R 12=12h after the rehydration process, n.s.=not significant.\n\nIntensity of fluorescence signal emitted by storage cells of the tardigradeParamacrobiotus spatialisas a marker of ROS production, detected 3h and 12h after the rehydration process (R) in animals kept in a desiccated state (D) for 1day and 20days, using the fluorescent probe 2,7 dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH2 DA).

Different letters above each column indicate significant differences in the fluorescence signals among the different experimental conditions. a.u.=arbitrary unit.

The storage cells of desiccated animals always emitted an intense fluorescence signal, while those of control ones emitted a faint spotted fluorescence signal (Fig.2). The intensity of the fluorescence signal emitted by the storage cells of desiccated animals was always significantly higher than the fluorescence intensity detected in cells of control animals (Fig.2; Table1; one way ANOVA: n=485;p<0.001). Moreover, the intensity of the fluorescence signal was at its highest level in the coelomocytes of animals kept desiccated for 20days, while the lowest signal was recorded in cells of tardigrades kept desiccated for 1day (Fig.2; Table1).\n\nRNA interference (RNAi) was used to disrupt the function of genes encoding proteins potentially involved in desiccation tolerance in the tardigradeParamacrobiotus spatialis.RNAi has previously been characterized in tardigrades and is known to target specific gene products for destruction both in adults during desiccation and in embryos during development24,57. Similarly, it has been shown that large amounts of non specific dsRNA (e.g.double stranded RNA targeting GFP) do not affect tardigrade survival24nor embryo viability and development57. In this study, the eight genes targeted by RNAi were:gpx,gr,gst,catandsod, encoding for enzymes (glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glutathione transferase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase, respectively) that counteract reactive oxygen species;tps, encoding for the enzyme trehalose 6 phosphate synthase, involved in the pathways of trehalose production;aqp 3andaqp 10, encoding for aquaporin proteins 3 and 10, which are presumably involved in the rapid transport of water through cell membranes.\n\nThe involvement of these target genes was verified by comparing the motilities ofP. spatialisanimals that have exited tun belonging to three groups: 1. uninjected control animals (control 1); 2. injected with RNase free water control animals (control 2); 3. injected animals with the double stranded RNA (dsRNA) of the target gene (experimental group). The motility of the animals after a period of anhydrobiosis was evaluated by monitoring locomotion performance (i.e. coordinate movements of the body) immediately after the rehydration process (t0), 1h (t1), 24h (t24), and 48h (t48) later.\n\nAdditionally, five specimens ofP. spatialiswere individually injected with dsRNA of each target gene, desiccated, and then rehydrated. A reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR) showed a marked decrease in the expression level of each target gene in comparison to DNA polymerase II (DNA pol II) used as a control gene (Fig.S1), indicating that RNA interference led to a decrease in the targeted gene's expression level.\n\nThe assessment of motility in both control 1 (uninjected) and control 2 (water injected) animals always resulted 100% (Fig.3a,b), since all animals are alive at each time point assayed after the rehydration process. These data demonstrate that the desiccation protocol was suitable forP. spatialis, and that the injection alone does not affect survival of the tardigrades during anhydrobiosis. On the other hand, significant differences were recorded between the motility percentages of both controls and most experimental groups (Fig.3; Kruskal Wallis test: number of pairwise comparisons=132;p<0.001). For treatments targeting antioxidant enzymes, specimens injected with dsRNA ofgpxshowed significantly lower motilities with respect to both types of controls at every time after the rehydration process (t0:p<0.001; t1:p<0.01; t24:p<0.01; t48:p<0.01; Fig.3c). In animals injected with dsRNA for genes ofgr,catandsod, significant differences with respect to both types of controls were only observed between the percentages of animal motilities recorded at t0(immediately after the rehydration process) (gr:p<0.01;cat:p<0.01;sod:p<0.01; Fig.3d,f,g). Significant differences in the motility percentages with respect to both types of controls were also evidenced at t0, t1and t24in animals injected with dsRNA ofaqp3(t0:p<0.01, t1:p<0.05; t24:p<0.05; Fig.3i) and at t0, t1and t24in animals injected with dsRNA ofaqp10(t0:p<0.001, t24:p<0.01; t48:p<0.01; Fig.3j).The motility percentages of animals injected with dsRNA of thegstandtpsgenes did not show significant differences with respect to both types of controls (uninjected and water injected) at every time after the rehydration process (Fig.3e,h). Since RNAi knockdown of thetpsgene resulted in negligible effects on the animal motilities at all times following rehydration, and since thetpsdsRNA was the largest used in our study (TableS2), we consider this gene as a further control (control 3), and further evidences that the injection of large amount of dsRNA is not harmful forP. spatialis. The motility percentages of animals injected with dsRNA targeting thetpsgene compared with the motility percentages of animals injected with dsRNA of other target genes shows significant differences (TableS3). These statistical differences are consistent with the scored significances of comparisons between controls (non injected and water injected) and target genes, except for motility at t0of animals injected withsoddsRNA, motilities at t1and t24of animals targeted foraqp3and motilities at t24and t48of animals targeted foraqp10(Fig.3; TableS3). Therefore, only for these exceptions is it possible to presume an effect onP. spatialismotilities was due to injection of large dsRNA.\n\nPercentages of tardigrades with motility recorded immediately after the rehydration process (t0), 1h (t1), 24h (t24) and 48h (t48) later in control animals and in specimens ofParamacrobiotus spatialisinjected with dsRNA of the target genes.

    "discussion": "This study provides an evaluation of oxidative stress production during desiccation in tardigrades through the direct assessment of the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in storage cells. In addition, this study assesses the degree of involvement of various bioprotectants in anhydrobiotic survival of tardigrades using RNA interference to perturb gene functions inParamacrobiotus spatialis.\n\nStorage cells are singular free floating cells accumulating polysaccharides, lipids, and proteins49,50,58. The faint spotted fluorescence emitted by the storage cells of the control specimens ofP. spatialisdenotes that in metabolically active animals there is a regular, but small, production of ROS due to the standard metabolic reactions. This has been reported in all living organisms, not only related to anhydrobiosis (see Frana et al.9; Kranner & Birti43; Boveris & Chance59). The storage cells of desiccated specimens ofP. spatialisemitted an intense fluorescence, demonstrating that anhydrobiosis causes a significant increase in ROS production and consequently of oxidative stress.\n\nPrevious reports evaluated the oxidative stress associated with desiccation in tardigrades indirectly, by assessing the antioxidant defences mounted in response to drying in whole animals22,46, or by evaluating the ROS damaged proteins that can accumulate as carbonylated products during the anhydrobiotic period60. Evidence of the production of free radicals (and consequently of oxidative stress) in anhydrobiosis has been found in other organisms, such as cyanobacteria (see Potts61), the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae(see Pereira et al.62),intertidal seaweeds (see Flores Molina et al.63), the mossFontinalis antipyretica(see Cruz de Carvalho et al.64) and the shrimpMarsupenaeus japonicas(see Duan et al.65).\n\nIn tardigrades, ROS production occurs both during desiccation, and while in a desiccated state. These data can explain the increase in mortality and/or in a long recovery time (i.e. time to recover active life after desiccation) measured inP. spatialisspecimens after extended periods in a desiccated state10. These two phenomena are directly proportional to the time spent in a desiccated state, since molecular damages are accumulated with time because metabolism is arrested, and repair systems are not working10. Oxidative stress leads to a long recovery time and to the death of tardigrades since the animals need more time to repair oxidation damages.\n\nThe glutathione pathway, including the enzymes glutathione peroxidase, glutathione transferase and glutathione reductase, is an important antioxidant system involved in the scavenging of ROS13. In this pathway, the glutathione peroxidase and glutathione transferase act by removing hydrogen peroxide, while the glutathione reductase reduces the glutathione disulphide to glutathione9,43. Targeting a gene encoding the antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase, which is induced by desiccation, compromised survival during desiccation, providing evidence for this gene's role in tardigrade desiccation tolerance. Targeting ofgpxby RNAi in the tardigradeP. spatialisresulted in a significant lower percentage of tardigrades with motility (i.e. lower survival) at every time after the rehydration process with respect to control animals kept hydrated and metabolically active (Controls 1 and 2) and with respect to animals targeted fortps(non effective gene, Control 3). The effects on the percent motility observed in animals injected with dsRNA ofgpxare enhanced by the presence of low copies of this gene in tardigrades25. A similar pattern was obtained with the knockdown of glutathione peroxidase transcripts by RNAi in the nematodePanagrolaimus superbus, which led to a decrease survival post desiccation66. The glutathione peroxidase enzyme has a crucial role during anhydrobiosis ofP. spatialis, since animals targeted forgpxdo not recover their motility indicating that other antioxidant enzymes or other endogenous molecules cannot fully replace essential roles of glutathione peroxidase. The important role of this molecule in desiccation tolerance ofP. spatialisextend the previous results of Rizzo et al.22, where glutathione peroxidase was one of the enzymes with the higher enzymatic activity. This enzyme is utilised to counteract ROS not only during the dehydration process, but also probably plays a vital role during the rehydration phase22and thus the enzyme encoded bygpxis essential for tardigrade anhydrobiosis. The crucial role of glutathione peroxidase in tardigrades is in line withits role in counteracting oxidative stress caused by desiccation in other organisms: e.g. in transgenic tobacco plants67, in the larvae of the midgeP. vanderplanki11, in the dauer larvae of the nematodeCaenorhabditis elegans68, and other species of nematodes66,69,70.\n\nThe targeting of glutathione transferase (gst) had no effects on the motilities of injected animals at any time following rehydration. GSTs have been seen to exist in high copy number in several tardigrade species25,71, implying thatP. spatialismay also have a high copy number of these genes. If this is the case, the knockdown of a single putative gene ofgstmight not be sufficient to perturb anhydrobiosis in this species.\n\nThe data obtained onP. spatialisspecimens targeted for glutathione reductase (gr) gene indicate that this molecule plays a role in the course of rehydration. Indeed, tardigrades targeted for this gene are immobile immediately after the rehydration process (t0), but then they recover their motility (t1 t48). Thegrmight eliminate the ROS accumulated during desiccation, but when it is targeted the ROS production is not completely counteracted and the targeted animals need more time to recover motility. Therefore, it is possible to presume that other endogenous molecules not targeted in these specimens take on the activities made by thegrduring rehydration, and therefore allow animals to recover their motilities.\n\nAnother defence counteracting the ROS toxicity involves the system made up by superoxide dismutase and catalase. The first destroys free radical superoxide converting it in H2O2which is then reduced by catalase72. The data obtained on specimens ofP. spatialiswhose for catalase (cat) gene had been perturbated by RNAi indicate that this molecule plays a role in the course of rehydration. Indeed, tardigrades targeted for this gene are immobile immediately after the rehydration process (t0), but then they recover their motility (t1 t48). Since the action of catalase is similar with that of glutathione peroxidase, it is probable that in animals targeted for catalase, the glutathione peroxidase takes on its function during rehydration. In other species of tardigrades and in other desiccation tolerant animals, experiments confirm the role of this enzyme in the desiccation process to prevent oxidative stress11,47,68,73,74. An upregulation of catalase gene during anhydrobiosis was detected in the tardigradeH.exemplaris(see Yoshida et al.47), in the midgesBelgica antarcticaandP. vanderplanki(see Cornette & Kikawada11; Lopez Martines et al.73) and in the nematodesAphelenchoides fragariaeandC. elegans(see Erkut et al.68; Fu et al.74). Targeting superoxide dismutase (sod) via RNAi did not negatively affect the motility percentages of injected animals at any time of rehydration. Comparing the gene repertoire of different tardigrade species, the duplication ofsodgenes was observed as a common characteristic of anhydrobiotic tardigrades25,71. SinceP. spatialisis a good anhydrobiont10,48, it is possible that itssodgenes are duplicated as well, and therefore, the targeting of a singlesodgene might not be enough to affect the motilities of injected tardigrades, even though thesodgenes could play a useful role during desiccation.\n\nThe trehalose 6 phosphate synthase (TPS) enzyme is involved, together with the enzyme trehalose 6 phosphate phosphatase, in the biosynthesis pathway of the sugar trehalose. This sugar acts as a common water replacement molecules and stabilizer of biological structures by protecting cellular systems from dehydration and preventing protein aggregation and eliminating ROS1,27,37,75. Despite most anhydrobiotic metazoans, such as the midgeP. vanderplankiand the cysts ofArtemiaspp., use trehalose as a protective mechanism1,38 40, not all tardigrade species produce this sugar, and when they produce it, the amount of trehalose differs among species and it is always very low in comparison with other anhydrobiotic animals20,39,76. The detection of trehalose inParamacrobiotusspecies20and of thetpsgene inP. spatialis77, allowed us to target this gene in this study, demonstrating that its targeting did not significantly affect animal motility after a cycle of desiccation/rehydration. In line with this, a recent study showed the presence of three TPS TPP genes inParamacrobiotussp.78, and probably the targeting of a single copy oftpsgene cannot be sufficient to have an effect on the motilities of injected animals. Our results demonstrate that trehalose is not the only molecule involved in desiccation tolerance, in line with the concept suggested by Hibshman et al.27that in desiccation tolerance of some tardigrades other molecules must have protective effects that substitute for the function of trehalose. Therefore, trehalose represents only one possible evolutionary pathway towards desiccation tolerance, and probably, is not the most crucial biochemical adaptation to protect cell during desiccation in tardigrades. This agrees with other completely desiccation tolerant organisms, namely bdelloid rotifers, that are unable to produce trehalose79. Rotifers protect the cells under desiccation stress utilizing different types of molecules, such as LEA proteins, hydrophilins, chaperones (i.e. Heat Shock proteins), antioxidants, and molecules involved in DNA repair6.\n\nAquaporins are integral membrane proteins present in all domains of life, ranging from archaea and bacteria to eukaryotes80. They play an intrinsic role in the physiological movements of water across cell membranes, and consequently through the entire organism11,81. They could be an adaptive response to changing water abundance and osmolality in the organism's habitat82, and to water loss regulation during anhydrobiosis15. Their possible role in anhydrobiotic animals was hypothesized by the discovery in the midgeP. vanderplankiof the aquaporin PvAQP145that rapidly increase its expression at the onset of anhydrobiosis and it is thought to be required to remove the water from the body of the midge larvae11,23,45. Similarly, in the larvae of the goldenrod gall flyEurosta solidaginis,the AQP3 protein which allows water and glycerol to cross the cell membrane is upregulated following desiccation, indicating that the larva is preparing itself for the osmotic stress associated with desiccation83. In tardigrades, the involvement of aquaporins during anhydrobiosis is supported by the expression of AQP4 inM.cf.tardigradum, at higher levels in the desiccated animals with respect to the active ones84. In the latter tardigrade species, eleven AQP transcripts (denoted MtAqp 1 through MtAqp 11) were identified85, with a high transcript abundance of MtAqp 3,  4,  5,  10. Our study provides evidence for the involvement of aquaporin 3 and aquaporin 10 during rehydration in tardigrades since the targeting for these two aquaporins inP. spatialisby RNAi has negative effects on animal motility immediately after rehydration process (t0). Since animals targeted for aquaporins are able to restore their motility in the course of the rehydration process (t1 t48),P. spatialiscan desiccate even if the aquaporins are targeted. However, during rehydration tardigrades need more time to recover their motility, suggesting that aquaporins have a role during rehydration.\n\nAlthough the molecular mechanisms underpinning anhydrobiosis are not yet completely understood, it seems clear that desiccation tolerance depends on the synergic action of an array of many different molecules working together. Our investigation supports this hypothesis and agrees with previous studies demonstrating that tardigrades species have a comprehensive number of genes encoding proteins involved in antioxidant defence25. Future studies on anhydrobiotic animals will further help in understanding the protectants and the mechanisms that contribute to their desiccation survival and could provide avenues for pursuing biotechnologies for the preservation, storage and distribution of human tissues and cells.",
